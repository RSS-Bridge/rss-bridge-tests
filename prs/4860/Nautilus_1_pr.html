The personality characteristics that affect dogs’ suitability for such tasks have life-and-death implications. But, with the myriad modern breeds, what makes for the best scent-detection dog?</p>            <p>A <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0339379" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new study</a> published in <em>PLOS One</em> figured out the ideal dog characteristics for scent detection, based on structured interviews with experts. Veterinary researchers from Utrecht University in the Netherlands interviewed 87 professional Dutch scent dog handlers and trainers, along with a control group of 23 civilian dog owners. The participants were asked to imagine that they could create their “ideal scent detection dog, as if it were a robot created in a laboratory.” They then scored their imaginary ideal dogs on 24 dog characteristics on a scale of zero (preferably not present in the dog) to 100 (preferably present).</p><p>Most dog handlers and trainers concurred that the ideal scent detection dog is confident, persistent, and resilient, with little neuroticism or insecurity. Confidence gives a scent dog the courage to deal with new environments; persistence keeps the dog on task until a scent is identified; and resilience confers an ability to rebound from unexpected stressors that may surface in the types of settings scent dogs face (for example, war zones, loud airports, and disaster sites).</p>           <p><strong>Read more: “<a href="https://nautil.us/the-doctor-will-sniff-you-now-238116/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Doctor Will Sniff You Now</a>”</strong></p><p>Handlers were also queried about how much deviation was acceptable from their idealized scent dog’s characteristics. Which characteristics could they concede on, and which were deal breakers?</p><p>The favored characteristics of “confidence,” “persistence,” and “resilience” were deemed deal-breakers for which the imaginary dog could deviate little or none. Most of the professional participants also refused to make concessions on “scent-oriented,” “independent,” and “imperturbable.”</p>           <p>“These characteristics [for which no concessions were made] are regarded as part of a dog’s personality and thus not easily influenced by training and/or management,” wrote the study authors. Even the characteristic of “scent-oriented behavior” arguably stems from a desire to seek out and investigate odors that is innately heightened in some dogs. </p><p>Professional handlers and trainers, on the other hand, were more willing to concede on the characteristic “precise” for their ideal dogs than civilians. The research hypothesized, from informal interview data, that professionals believed they could improve a dog’s precision through training, while civilians didn’t. Professionals also ranked “possessiveness” as a positive and required characteristic. In contrast, civilians tended to view “possessiveness” as negative, and assessed “impulsiveness” and “excitability” as less desirable characteristics. </p><p>So, while anyone handling a dog would like to see confidence, persistence, and resilience, the ideal scent dog to be handled by professionals should also be scent-oriented, independent, and basically unflappable. <img decoding="async" class="wp-image-13765" style="width: 14px;" src="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/nautilus-favicon-14.png?fm=png" alt=""></p>           <p><em>Enjoying  </em><a href="https://nautil.us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nautilus</a><em>?

It’s equipped with an iron-reinforced radula for eating, a series of plates on its back, and a fleshy foot. Like all members of the genus <em>Ferreiraella</em>, its posterior is home to worms that feed on its excrement. In other words, there was a lot for Ze Frank’s followers to work with. They submitted more than 8,000 names for SOSA scientists to choose from. </p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G7HkBBJO7ZU?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://nautil.us">https://www.youtube.com/embed/G7HkBBJO7ZU?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://nautil.us</a> </div></figure>           <p>“We were overwhelmed by the response and the massive number of creative name suggestions!” SOSA co-chair Julia Sigwart said in a statement.

We’ve used it to cook our food, temper our tools, warm our bodies, and ward off predators. It’s not overstating things to say it’s fueled our evolution, but has our exposure to it changed our genes?</p>            <p>It’s an intriguing proposition. After all, fire is an indispensable tool but also a dangerous one. Before we developed antibiotics, even a small burn could become a mortal wound. So it stands to reason that after such a long period of our history living by the fireside, natural selection would have granted us some resiliency. </p><p>To investigate, Joshua Cuddihy of the Imperial College London worked alongside a team of burn-injury experts, evolutionary biologists, and geneticists to identify burn-response genes for signs of positive selection. This week they <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bies.70109" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published</a> their findings in <em>BioEssays</em>. </p>           <p><strong>Read more: “<a href="https://nautil.us/wildfires-are-changing-animal-evolution-357151/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wildfires Are Changing Animal Evolution</a>”</strong></p><p>To identify possible burn-injury response genes, researchers examined the transcriptomes (the genes expressed) in both burnt and unburnt skin from humans and rats. Examining the gene sequences, they discovered a subset of burn response genes that showed evidence of accelerated evolution. </p><p>So what do these genes do? </p>           <p>They’re primarily involved in wound closure, inflammation, and immune system response. Unfortunately these genes also respond to general tissue damage, so the team was unable to rule out positive selection in response to other human endeavors, like tool use or fighting. Still, researchers stress that these genes aren’t exhaustive, and they illustrate how fire could have imprinted its unique brand on our genome.  </p><p>In the future, the team hopes this new framework will help connect evolutionary biology with medicine, changing how we study and treat burn injuries and even help to explain why animal models of burns often produce results that translate poorly to humans. <img decoding="async" class="wp-image-13765" style="width: 14px;" src="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/nautilus-favicon-14.png?fm=png" alt=""></p><p><em>Enjoying  </em><a href="https://nautil.us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nautilus</a><em>?

Shortly after, the moon and sun cut off his head. His immortal noggin pursued them in order to eat them, and eclipses occur whenever he’s able to grab and feast on them. “Since his head was cut off, the sun or moon just falls out the hole where his neck used to be,” <a href="https://blogs.loc.gov/folklife/2017/08/solar-eclipse-awe-wonder-and-belief/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to</a> an article in the Library of Congress. </p><p>Other moon-eating tales have come from China and Korea, where dogs are seen as the culprit.</p><p>Christianity also offers unique perspectives on the blood moon. During the First Crusade, for instance, at the end of the 11th century A.D., historian Albert of Aachen claimed that the crusaders saw a blood moon on their way to Jerusalem. “Those who had knowledge about the eclipse as a signal of God’s will, Albert tells us, comforted the fearful,” historian Beth Spacey <a href="https://theconversation.com/medieval-christians-saw-the-lunar-eclipse-as-a-sign-from-god-but-they-also-understood-the-science-160759" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a> for <em>The Conversation</em>. </p>           <p>Albert thought that lunar eclipses portended the downfall of their enemies, while some other Christian scholars from around that time urged people not to get carried away with woo-woo explanations. After all, it was already known by this time that they occur when the Earth blocks the moon. Far more recently, in 2014, some Christians <a href="https://sojo.net/articles/blood-moon-sets-apocalyptic-debate-among-some-christians" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">saw</a> a series of blood moons as a sign of Jesus’ return.</p><p>Whatever meaning you associate with the lunar eclipse, you can see it most clearly by moving away from bright lights.

Their trophic position is similar to that of secondary consumers, an intermediate level in the food chain, as is the case with most salamanders.” </p><p>Once the giant salamanders crossed the two-foot mark, they were able to feast on crabs, frogs, and fish, catapulting them to apex predator status. This ability to capture larger prey without becoming prey themselves gives them an incredible adaptive advantage, fueling the evolution of stronger jaws and a larger body size.</p>           <p>The team hopes these new insights will aid in conservation efforts of the species, which is unfortunately flagged as vulnerable.  </p><p>It can definitely be lonely at the top of the food chain. <img decoding="async" class="wp-image-13765" style="width: 14px;" src="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/nautilus-favicon-14.png?fm=png" alt=""></p><p><em>Enjoying  </em><a href="https://nautil.us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nautilus</a><em>?

By about age 2, humans engage in pretend scenarios, but to date, there have been no controlled studies of so-called “pretense” in other animals. It’s not an easy task. If you think about it, pretend play requires forming a mental representation of something that’s absent and keeping it distinct from perceptions of reality. </p><p><strong>Read more: “<a href="https://nautil.us/empathy-morality-community-cultureapes-have-it-all-234306/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Empathy, Morality, Community, Culture—Apes Have It All</a>”</strong></p><p>Krupenye and co-author <a href="https://research-portal.st-andrews.ac.uk/en/persons/amalia-bastos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amalia P.M. Bastos</a> worked with Kanzi, a 43-year-old captive bonobo (now <a href="https://www.apeinitiative.org/remembering-kanzi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deceased</a>), famous for his groundbreaking language abilities. Kanzi was the first nonhuman ape known to understand spoken English and communicate using more than 300 symbols. The researchers presented Kanzi with an 18-trial session in which he was rewarded with juice for correctly choosing between two clear squirt bottles—one empty and one with juice.</p>           <p>Next, Kanzi was presented with two clear, empty cups. After researchers pretended to fill them from an (empty) pitcher and then pour the imaginary contents of one cup back into the pitcher, Kanzi had to answer, “Where’s the juice?” Without receiving any rewards this time, he chose the cup still containing the imaginary juice 68 percent of the time, which is significantly more than chance. </p><p>In a related experiment, Kanzi had to choose which clear jar contained pretend grapes after watching a researcher pretend to sample one from each jar, then “empty” one of the jars. Here again, Kanzi chose the jar that still contained pretend grapes significantly more than chance would dictate.  </p><p>Kanzi’s behavior showed that he could conceive of absent things, which opens new questions about whether behavior observed in wild apes is also imagination-based. For example, wild female chimpanzees carry sticks around, perhaps as an imitation of how mother chimps carry their children. </p>           <p>“The capacity to form secondary representations of pretend objects is within the cognitive potential of, at least, an enculturated ape and likely dates back 6 to 9 million years, to our common evolutionary ancestors,” concluded the study authors. <img decoding="async" class="wp-image-13765" style="width: 14px;" src="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/nautilus-favicon-14.png?fm=png" alt=""></p><p><em>Enjoying  </em><a href="https://nautil.us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nautilus</a><em>?

Now, research <a href="https://www.cell.com/the-innovation/fulltext/S2666-6758(25)00289-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published</a> in <em>The Innovation</em> about a recently uncovered <em>Archaeopteryx</em> fossil shows that birds got their fascinating structures early in their evolution. </p>            <p>The <em>Archaeopteryx</em> fossil in question arrived at the Chicago Field Museum in 2022, and chief preparator Akiko Shinya began the painstaking process of chipping away limestone to reveal the full specimen. To ensure she didn’t remove any important parts of the fossil, Shinya used an ultraviolet light, which causes fossilized soft tissues to glow. That’s when she noticed something strange. </p><p>“I remember them calling me over and saying, ‘Jingmai, we found something strange, come look at it,’” study author Jingmai O’Connor said in a <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1114981" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement</a>. “They showed me these tiny, glowing dots, and I had no idea what we were looking at.”</p>           <p>After consulting texts on bird anatomy, O’Connor realized what they were: oral papillae. “Imagine if the flesh on the roof of your mouth just had rows and rows of tiny, fleshy cones—that’s what birds have,” said O’Connor. These structures facilitate feeding by guiding food down the bird’s throat while steering it clear of the windpipe. </p><p><strong>Read more: “<a href="https://nautil.us/conjuring-imaginary-creatures-1204463/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Conjuring Imaginary Creatures</a>”</strong></p><p>But that’s not all, the team also discovered ​​a tiny sliver of bone in the tongue. “This teeny-tiny bone is one of the smallest bones in the body, and it indicates that <em>Archaeopteryx</em> had a highly mobile tongue, like many birds today,” O’Connor added.</p>           <p>A CT scan of the head revealed even more secrets—little tunnels in the beak, indicating spaces where nerves would have been. Taken together, the articulated tongue, oral papillae, and enervated, sensitive bill all point to an overall adaptive push toward finding and eating food, and O’Connor believes she knows why: While flight confers enormous benefits, it doesn’t come without costs, and the biggest one is the demand for more energy. </p><p>“These discoveries show this really clear shift in how dinosaurs were feeding when they started flying and had to meet the enormous energetic demands of flight,” O’Connor explained. “Birds have a super-efficient digestive system—everything is modified to maximize the efficiency of eating and the calories that they can extract from food. And the digestive system starts with the mouth.”</p><p>While all birds are dinosaurs, not all dinosaurs are birds, and these structures can help researchers draw a clearer line between the two. </p>           <p>“For a long time, there have been very few things that we could say really characterize the transition from terrestrial dinosaurs to flying bird dinosaurs,” O’Connor said. “These weird little features in the mouth of Archaeopteryx, that are also found in living birds, are giving us new criteria that we can use to tell whether a dinosaur fossil is a bird or not.” <img decoding="async" class="wp-image-13765" style="width: 14px;" src="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/nautilus-favicon-14.png?fm=png" alt=""></p><p><em>Enjoying  </em><a href="https://nautil.us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nautilus</a><em>?

Chemist Dmitri Mendeleev dreamt up the organization of the periodic table. Mary Shelley dreamt the two main scenes that became the famous Gothic novel <em>Frankenstein</em>. Niels Bohr solved the structure of the atom. And Elias Howe hit upon a major invention in his sleep. He had been struggling with the problem of how to design an effective sewing machine. Then, one night, he dreamt he was being attacked by warriors with spears that had holes at their tips. The dream inspired a eureka moment: He realized he could design a sewing needle with an eye at the point instead of at the top, an innovation that led to the first clothing factories.<br><br>But can we deliberately harness the fertile realm of dreaming to creatively solve problems? It’s a question scientists have struggled to answer, in part because dreams are elusive and difficult to manipulate in a reliable way. This is the field of dream engineering. <br><br>Recently, a team of neuroscientists from Northwestern University set out to see if lucid dreaming might yield some new insights. Lucid dreamers are consciously aware they’re dreaming and can control the narrative, and some estimates suggest that a little over half of us can lucid dream, which is a trainable skill. What the scientists <a href="https://academic.oup.com/nc/article/2026/1/niaf067/8456489" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">found</a> surprised them: They were able to manipulate the dreams of their participants using auditory cues, prompting them to dream about puzzles that they’d learned to associate with those sounds while awake. But it was the non-lucid dreams that were most often linked to problem-solving. Was it the dreaming itself or other unconscious processes? Many questions remain. Still, the findings suggest that dreaming could one day become a problem-solving tool.<br><br>I spoke to American neuroscientist and study author Ken Paller about the relationship between dreaming and creativity and the potential uses and risks of dream engineering.</p>            <p><strong>Dreams and REM sleep have long been associated with creativity. Why is that?</strong></p><p>Sleep is about a lot more than just restoration. We sleep to not be sleepy during the day and to be alert, but there’s a lot more going on. The brain’s not turned off. It’s quite busy. In my work on memory, I’ve looked at how all the things we learn each day need to be processed further, and integrated with other knowledge, so that they can be remembered later. And a lot of that happens unconsciously while we’re asleep. That’s the interesting part of sleep from a cognitive neuroscience point-of-view. Our waking cognition is partly a function of what happens while we sleep.</p>           <p>This work is an extension of that idea, because creativity is connected to memory. When you put the individual fragments of memories together in new ways, seeing how they relate to problems you have, or questions you have, that’s a creative function. Finding those connections is a foundation for our creativity. That’s why it makes sense that both of those things are happening during our sleep: improving memory storage as well as creativity.<br><br><strong>People have been talking about dream engineering for some time now. How has the science changed?</strong></p><p>Dream research was a lot harder in the old days, because you could only ask people what they were dreaming about <em>after</em> they woke up. Now we ask them while they’re still asleep. We can present a question to people and have them give a signal with their eyes moving or their nose sniffing to tell us what’s happening at that moment, while they’re still in REM sleep and dreaming. That gives us an additional vantage point, and new opportunities for dream engineering. On top of that, we can look at brain activity at that moment and try to work out what the brain activity means, which is still a hard challenge, but we’re working on it.</p><p><strong>Read more: “<a href="https://nautil.us/narcoleptic-naps-are-a-creative-sweet-spot-259482/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Creative Sweet Spot of Dreaming</a>”</strong></p>           <p><strong>You used soundtracks to influence your participants’ dreams. Why do auditory cues work for dream engineering?</strong></p><p>Prior to our 2009 study, there was this great study by Björn Rasch and his colleagues in Germany. They used odors and they thought, “We’ve gotta use odors because odors get in without waking you up, and they bypass the part of the brain called the thalamus.” At that time, people thought the thalamus would block out every sound or sight or any other modality except olfaction. So their thinking was, it’s gotta be olfaction. We came into it and thought, “Well, maybe, maybe not.” So we tried sounds, and in fact, there’s plenty of evidence that sounds do get in during sleep. An alarm clock works, but even soft sounds are processed in your brain, and—as we show—influence what kind of memories you process and the problems you’re thinking of.<br><br>This is a method we’ve used since 2009 in a <em>Science</em> paper we published. We call it targeted memory reactivation, where we first have people learn something before sleep. And then, during sleep, we decide which of the things they learned they’re going to process more. Targeted memory reactivation is where we play some sounds that are connected to something they learned, and we know it reactivates specific memories because when they wake up, they’re better at remembering those memories. So we can tinker with memory storage in that way. And we think it also happens naturally. I mean, you don’t need sounds, you’re always reactivating things, but we can bias which things with our method and therefore study how it works.</p><p>This isn’t entirely new. Aristotle described how if you hear some dripping water in your sleep, you might dream about water. But we were using this phenomenon in a very systematic way to say, “Here are these sounds that are connected specifically with puzzles you failed to solve when you were awake.”</p>           <p><strong>You expected that people would solve more problems while they were lucid dreaming as opposed to non-lucid dreaming? Why?</strong></p><p>The idea was that you could intentionally try a particular strategy in your lucid dream. So in your lucid dream, maybe you would have some ability to get at the information that’s hidden away in your brain. And you might do that by not just thinking about it as the dreamer, but maybe summoning another character in your dream and saying, “Well, I think my brother might know the answer to that.” That’s a strategy that people use in their lucid dreams. We didn’t find that it particularly worked in this study, though. There might be better strategies, but it’s hard because not that many people have lucid dreams and they don’t have them that often. So we have to keep working on that challenge and on getting more evidence. How could you intentionally use your dreams for certain goals? We’re studying intentional dreaming in other contexts, too, with people who can develop these skills to a very high level.</p><p><strong>I noticed in the study you told your participants to ask the dream itself for help on the problem. Why did you give them this prompt, and how do you think that works?</strong></p>           <p>The thinking is that your unconscious mind has more information than your conscious mind knows about. That’s undoubtedly true, but how to get to it. And you can also say your unconscious mind has more creativity. How do you unleash it? How do you get to that creativity? That’s a really exciting idea—that some people might have more access to that intuitive part of themselves and that playfulness, to get more creativity. And maybe we could learn how to do that using strategies like this. We may find some shortcuts.</p><p>Lucid-dreaming experts tell me that they often can’t just will things to happen in their lucid dream. They have to be subtle about it. So just demanding, “Give me the answer, dream!” doesn’t seem to work so well. From what they say, that doesn’t lead to success but other more subtle strategies, where they try to sneak up on the answer, can sometimes work for them. So dream control is possible for lucid dreamers, but it has its limits and can be challenging. It’s more like working with your dream as a partner rather than dominating it.</p><p><strong>You write in the study that the findings mostly relate to convergent creativity, where there is a single right answer. Why is this?</strong></p>           <p>The creativity research field has multiple theories about how you get to answers. Sometimes you go strategically step-by-step and reach the answer. Other times it just sort of appears suddenly in an “aha” moment, and you don’t see the process that brought you there. The problems we gave our study participants all had a single right answer so we could know when they reached the correct solution, but they often had dead ends, too. Like one of the problems was, “You have to plant four trees equidistant from each other. In what arrangement do you plant your trees so that each one’s the same distance from the other three?” You start thinking about it, and you think, “Okay, I plant them in a square.” And then you come to the conclusion, “No, in a square they’re not gonna be equidistant from each other. That doesn’t work.” And you think, “Okay, a diamond, or some other shape, what do I do?” </p><p>You struggle with it. But you’re thinking in a two-dimensional way, and the key insight is to think in three dimensions. If there’s a hill, then you could have three in a triangle and one in the middle on top and they could all be equidistant. That’s the solution—to go to that additional dimension. A lot of problems are like that, where the way you initially think is not gonna get you the answer, but you have to unhook from that and try a new way. That’s the creativity. It’s like they say, “You have to think outside the box.”</p><p><strong>Do your results change how we think about the relationship between dreams and creativity or problem-solving?</strong></p>           <p>I think it opens the door to the idea that dreams can offer a wealth of insight and creativity that you could use to your advantage. You might benefit from that, compared to ignoring your dreams. But scientifically, I’m also happy with the idea that your unconscious mind is where that wealth is. And your dreams just provide a little glimpse into it. I’m willing to play both sides of that argument and say dreams could be really important, or maybe not. For now, we’re just trying to understand how the brain works. Everyone knows sleeping on a problem can help you get to the right answer. We’ve just never been sure where dreaming fits in with all that. And I’m still not sure.</p><p><strong>How do you ultimately want to use this research?</strong></p><p>The next research frontier could relate to mental health. If you’re spending time really bothered by something, or having depressing thoughts all day long, we figure those thoughts are gonna come up again during your sleep and influence how your sleep goes. And how you feel the next day! And so, one of our new research questions is to see, okay, is that contributing to people having anxiety and depression during the day? And can we bias their overnight memory reactivation in a better direction? </p>           <p>So we might engineer dreams not just to solve problems, but perhaps to improve your psychological well-being. Can we have wearable devices where people would strategically decide what sounds they wanted that could guide them in particular ways? Outside of made-up brain teasers that no one really cares about, can we move this to the life issues that people do have, and beyond that, to the big problems we have in the world today?</p><p><strong>Is there any danger that dream engineering could be misused?</strong></p><p>There are always dangers, and we always have to think carefully about the ethical issues that could come up. Our techniques could be misused. I wrote a paper that was subtitled “Sleeping in a Brave New World” in 2017. Let’s take an unscrupulous hotel owner, for example. They could rig up something with your hotel bed to play advertising to you when you’re asleep. Would you want advertising when you were asleep? You wouldn’t even know that you were exposed to it, if it came in while you were asleep. We have rules against subliminal advertising, but people push the rules sometimes. That’s one example I could imagine. Also, it could be misused by people interrogating suspected criminals. Sleep tactics are already used in the sense that sleep deprivation is a cruel punishment for people in prison that can mess you up pretty badly.</p>           <p><strong>Do these techniques of dream engineering and problem-solving carry any other risks?</strong></p><p>There could be opportunities, and there could be costs. Some of our studies have shown, in the memory context, that if we play sounds too loud, the sounds can arouse people from deep sleep. So if they disturb sleep, that’s bad. And it’s bad not just for their sleep, but also, the memories get worse instead of better. So, there’s a danger of doing sleep engineering in a way that’s not prioritizing high-quality sleep. We’re really careful to play these sounds very, very softly. In our experiments we watch the ongoing sleep physiology and monitor the sound levels carefully, so that they’re not disrupting sleep.</p><p>Another question is that if we reactivate some memories, then are other memories not getting reactivated? Maybe you’re missing out on something important that your natural sleep would’ve accomplished. So we have to consider these issues, that there could be some trade-offs. In each case, one would need to ask whether the trade-off is worth it.</p>           <p>It might be, if you get a memory boost you genuinely need, an improvement in learning in a rehab context, or an answer to a major problem in your life. <img decoding="async" class="wp-image-13765" style="width: 14px;" src="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/nautilus-favicon-14.png?fm=png" alt=""></p><p><em>Enjoying  </em><a href="https://nautil.us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nautilus</a><em>?

Ultimately, PTFE guarded the Oak Ridge uranium plant’s pipes for decades. </p><p>PTFE began its trajectory to our kitchens in 1945, when the Teflon trademark was <a href="https://www.aps.org/archives/publications/apsnews/202104/history.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">registered</a> by Kinetic Chemicals, a collaboration between DuPont and General Motors. Not long after, Kinetic Chemicals began churning out more than 2 million pounds of Teflon per year. New versions of PTFE soon emerged that were easier to mold or extrude, and its commercial appeal continued to grow. In 1961, the first Teflon-coated <a href="https://nemo.asee.org/public/conferences/327/papers/38301/view" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">skillet</a>, known as the Happy Pan, hit the U.S. market.</p>           <p><strong>Read more: “<a href="https://nautil.us/can-humanity-stem-the-plastic-tide-1230748/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Can Humanity Stem the Plastic Tide?</a>”</strong></p><p>Later that decade, Wilbert and Bob Gore invented a waterproof fabric that incorporated a type of PTFE—today, Gore-Tex is found in many hiking boots and raincoats. You can also find PTFE in plenty of other products these days, including makeup, medical equipment, kitchen appliances, sofas, and dental floss.</p><p>PTFE prompted the development of a massive family of chemicals known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS. They have long proven valuable because they tend to repeal water, heat, and grease, and are super tough. Their extraordinary durability owes to their carbon-fluorine bonds, which are some of the <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/researchers-have-developed-a-way-to-break-down-long-lasting-pfas-compounds-using-light" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strongest</a> known in chemistry.</p>           <p>These remarkably tight bonds ensure that PFAS linger in the environment, and these chemicals can <a href="https://www.epa.gov/pfas/our-current-understanding-human-health-and-environmental-risks-pfas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">make their way</a> into our bodies through air, soil, water, and food, among other avenues.
