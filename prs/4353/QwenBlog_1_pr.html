These are the deep waters that QwQ (Qwen with Questions) wades into. Like an eternal student of wisdom, it approaches every problem - be it mathematics, code, or knowledge of our world - with genuine wonder and doubt. QwQ embodies that ancient philosophical spirit: it knows that it knows nothing, and that&rsquo;s precisely what drives its curiosity. Before settling on any answer, it turns inward, questioning its own assumptions, exploring different paths of thought, always seeking deeper truth. Yet, like all seekers of wisdom, QwQ has its limitations. This version is but an early step on a longer journey - a student still learning to walk the path of reasoning. Its thoughts sometimes wander, its answers aren&rsquo;t always complete, and its wisdom is still growing. But isn&rsquo;t that the beauty of true learning? To be both capable and humble, knowledgeable yet always questioning? We invite you to explore alongside QwQ, embracing both its insights and its imperfections as part of the endless quest for understanding.</p><h1 id=limitations>Limitations<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#limitations>#</a></h1><p><strong>QwQ-32B-Preview</strong> is an experimental research model developed by the Qwen Team, focused on advancing AI reasoning capabilities. As a preview release, it demonstrates promising analytical abilities while having several important limitations:</p><ol><li><strong>Language Mixing and Code-Switching</strong>: The model may mix languages or switch between them unexpectedly, affecting response clarity.</li><li><strong>Recursive Reasoning Loops</strong>: The model may enter circular reasoning patterns, leading to lengthy responses without a conclusive answer.</li><li><strong>Safety and Ethical Considerations</strong>: The model requires enhanced safety measures to ensure reliable and secure performance, and users should exercise caution when deploying it.</li><li><strong>Performance and Benchmark Limitations</strong>: The model excels in math and coding but has room for improvement in other areas, such as common sense reasoning and nuanced language understanding.</li></ol><h1 id=performance>Performance<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#performance>#</a></h1><p>Through deep exploration and countless trials, we discovered something profound: when given time to ponder, to question, and to reflect, the model&rsquo;s understanding of mathematics and programming blossoms like a flower opening to the sun. Just as a student grows wiser by carefully examining their work and learning from mistakes, our model achieves deeper insight through patient, thoughtful analysis. This process of careful reflection and self-questioning leads to remarkable breakthroughs in solving complex problems. Our journey of discovery revealed the model&rsquo;s exceptional ability to tackle some of the most challenging problems in mathematics and programming, including:</p><ul><li>GPQA: A Graduate-Level Google-Proof Q&A Benchmark, a challenging benchmark for evaluating scientific problem-solving abilities through grade school level questions.</li><li>AIME: American Invitation Mathematics Evaluation, which tests mathematical problem solving with arithmetic, algebra, counting, geometry, number theory, and probability and other secondary school math topics.</li><li>MATH-500: The 500 test cases of the MATH benchmark, a comprehensive dataset testing mathematical problem-solving.</li><li>LiveCodeBench: A challenging benchmark for evaluating code generation and problem solving abilities in real-world programming scenarios.</li></ul><figure><img src=https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/assets/blog/qwq-32b-preview/QwQ-32B-Preview_result.png#center width=100%></figure><p>Specifically, QwQ demonstrates remarkable performance across these benchmarks, achieving impressive scores of 65.2% on GPQA, showcasing its graduate-level scientific reasoning capabilities; 50.0% on AIME, highlighting its strong mathematical problem-solving skills; 90.6% on MATH-500, demonstrating exceptional mathematical comprehension across diverse topics; and 50.0% on LiveCodeBench, validating its robust programming abilities in real-world scenarios. These results underscore QwQ&rsquo;s significant advancement in analytical and problem-solving capabilities, particularly in technical domains requiring deep reasoning.</p><h1 id=demo-cases>Demo Cases<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#demo-cases>#</a></h1><p>In the following examples, we invite you to witness the profound depths of QwQ-32B-Preview&rsquo;s contemplative abilities. Like a seeker of wisdom on an endless journey of discovery, the model demonstrates its capacity for deep introspection - questioning its own assumptions, engaging in thoughtful self-dialogue, and carefully examining each step of its reasoning process. Through these cases, you&rsquo;ll observe how QwQ embodies the timeless understanding that true knowledge emerges not from hasty conclusions, but from patient inquiry and the courage to challenge one&rsquo;s own certainties in the eternal pursuit of truth.</p><div class="full-width-container example-container"><div class=example-content><div class=title><span>Example: Logical Reasoning</span> <a class=next-button>Next</a></div><div class=grid-layout><div class=role>User</div><div class=content>Please add a pair of parentheses to the incorrect equation: 1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9 = 479, to make the equation true.</div><div class=role>QwQ-32B-Preview</div><div class=content><p>Let&rsquo;s tackle this problem step by step. The equation given is:</p><p>1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9 = 479</p><p>But it&rsquo;s incorrect, and I need to add a pair of parentheses to make it true. Okay, first things first, I should understand what the current value of the left side is without any parentheses.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s recall the order of operations: PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction). So, multiplication comes before addition.</p><p>So, calculating step by step:</p><p>2 * 3 = 6</p><p>4 * 5 = 20</p><p>6 * 7 = 42</p><p>8 * 9 = 72</p><p>Now, plugging these back into the equation:</p><p>1 + 6 + 20 + 42 + 72</p><p>Adding these up:</p><p>1 + 6 = 7</p><p>7 + 20 = 27</p><p>27 + 42 = 69</p><p>69 + 72 = 141</p><p>So, without any parentheses, the left side equals 141, but it should be 479. That&rsquo;s quite a difference. So, I need to add a pair of parentheses to make it equal to 479.</p><p>I need to think about where to place the parentheses to alter the order of operations to achieve the desired result.</p><p>Let me consider different possibilities:</p><ol><li>Parenthesizing individual terms:</li></ol><p>For example, (1 + 2) * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9</p><p>Calculate inside the parentheses first:</p><p>(1 + 2) = 3</p><p>Then, 3 * 3 = 9</p><p>Now, the equation becomes:</p><p>9 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9</p><p>Following order of operations:</p><p>4 * 5 = 20</p><p>6 * 7 = 42</p><p>8 * 9 = 72</p><p>So, 9 + 20 + 42 + 72 = 143</p><p>Still not 479.</p><ol start=2><li>Parenthesizing more terms:</li></ol><p>What if I do (1 + 2 * 3) + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9</p><p>First, calculate inside the parentheses:</p><p>1 + 2 * 3</p><p>Here, multiplication comes before addition, so 2 * 3 = 6, then 1 + 6 = 7</p><p>So, the equation becomes:</p><p>7 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9</p><p>Again, following order of operations:</p><p>4 * 5 = 20</p><p>6 * 7 = 42</p><p>8 * 9 = 72</p><p>So, 7 + 20 + 42 + 72 = 141</p><p>Same as before.</p><ol start=3><li>Let&rsquo;s try (1 + 2) * (3 + 4) * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9</li></ol><p>First, calculate inside the parentheses:</p><p>(1 + 2) = 3</p><p>(3 + 4) = 7</p><p>So, 3 * 7 * 5 = 105</p><p>Now, the equation becomes:</p><p>105 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9</p><p>Following order of operations:</p><p>6 * 7 = 42</p><p>8 * 9 = 72</p><p>So, 105 + 42 + 72 = 219</p><p>Still not 479.</p><ol start=4><li>Maybe trying to group more terms:</li></ol><p>(1 + 2 * 3 + 4) * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9</p><p>First, calculate inside the parentheses:</p><p>1 + 2 * 3 + 4</p><p>Multiplication first: 2 * 3 = 6</p><p>Then, 1 + 6 + 4 = 11</p><p>So, 11 * 5 = 55</p><p>Now, the equation becomes:</p><p>55 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9</p><p>Following order of operations:</p><p>6 * 7 = 42</p><p>8 * 9 = 72</p><p>So, 55 + 42 + 72 = 169</p><p>Getting closer, but still not 479.</p><ol start=5><li>Let&rsquo;s try a different approach.

Hmm, that seems pretty big, but I think I can break it down step by step.</p><p>First, I know that finding prime factors of large exponents can be tricky, but there might be some properties or theorems that can help simplify the process. Since the expression is $ 2019^8 + 1 $, maybe I can look for patterns or ways to factor this expression.</p><p>I recall that expressions of the form $ a^n + b^n $ can sometimes be factored, especially when $ n $ is a power of 2. In this case, $ n = 8 $, which is $ 2^3 $, so that might be useful.</p><p>Let me see if I can factor $ 2019^8 + 1 $. I know that $ a^4 + 1 $ can be factored as $ (a^4 + 1) = (a^2 + \sqrt{2}a + 1)(a^2 - \sqrt{2}a + 1) $, but that involves irrational numbers, which isn&rsquo;t helpful for factoring into integers. Maybe there&rsquo;s another way.</p><p>Wait, perhaps I can write $ 2019^8 + 1 $ as $ (2019^4)^2 + 1^2 $, which resembles the sum of squares. I know that over the integers, sums of squares don&rsquo;t factor nicely, but maybe there&rsquo;s a different approach.</p><p>Another thought: maybe I can consider smaller exponents first and see if there&rsquo;s a pattern or a recurring factor that appears.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s try computing $ 2019^2 + 1 $, $ 2019^4 + 1 $, and so on, and see if I can find any common factors or patterns.</p><p>First, calculate $ 2019^2 + 1 $:</p><p>$ 2019^2 = 2019 \times 2019 $. I don&rsquo;t need the exact value right now; maybe I can just keep it as $ 2019^2 $ for now.</p><p>So, $ 2019^2 + 1 = 2019^2 + 1 $. Doesn&rsquo;t seem immediately helpful.</p><p>Next, $ 2019^4 + 1 $. Again, it&rsquo;s similar to the previous expression, and I don&rsquo;t see an obvious factorization.</p><p>Maybe I should try to see if there are any small prime numbers that divide $ 2019^8 + 1 $. Since I&rsquo;m looking for the least odd prime factor, I can start testing small primes like 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on, to see if any of them divide $ 2019^8 + 1 $.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s start with 3. To check if 3 divides $ 2019^8 + 1 $, I can compute $ 2019^8 + 1 $ modulo 3.</p><p>First, find $ 2019 $ modulo 3. Since $ 2019 = 3 \times 673 $, $ 2019 \equiv 0 \pmod{3} $. Therefore, $ 2019^8 \equiv 0^8 \equiv 0 \pmod{3} $, and $ 2019^8 + 1 \equiv 0 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{3} $. So, 3 does not divide $ 2019^8 + 1 $.</p><p>Next, check 5. Compute $ 2019 $ modulo 5. $ 2019 \div 5 = 403 $ with a remainder of 4, so $ 2019 \equiv 4 \pmod{5} $. Then, $ 2019^8 \equiv 4^8 \pmod{5} $. Since $ 4 \equiv -1 \pmod{5} $, $ 4^8 \equiv (-1)^8 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} $. Therefore, $ 2019^8 + 1 \equiv 1 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{5} $, so 5 does not divide $ 2019^8 + 1 $.</p><p>Now, check 7. Find $ 2019 $ modulo 7. $ 2019 \div 7 = 288 $ with a remainder of 3, so $ 2019 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} $. Then, $ 2019^8 \equiv 3^8 \pmod{7} $. Let&rsquo;s compute $ 3^8 $ modulo 7.</p><p>First, find the pattern of powers of 3 modulo 7:</p><p>$ 3^1 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} $</p><p>$ 3^2 \equiv 9 \equiv 2 \pmod{7} $</p><p>$ 3^3 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} $</p><p>$ 3^4 \equiv 18 \equiv 4 \pmod{7} $</p><p>$ 3^5 \equiv 12 \equiv 5 \pmod{7} $</p><p>$ 3^6 \equiv 15 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} $</p><p>Since $ 3^6 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} $, then $ 3^8 = 3^{6+2} = 3^6 \times 3^2 \equiv 1 \times 2 \equiv 2 \pmod{7} $. Therefore, $ 2019^8 + 1 \equiv 2 + 1 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} $, so 7 does not divide $ 2019^8 + 1 $.</p><p>Next, check 11. Compute $ 2019 $ modulo 11. $ 2019 \div 11 = 183 $ with a remainder of 6, so $ 2019 \equiv 6 \pmod{11} $. Then, $ 2019^8 \equiv 6^8 \pmod{11} $. Let&rsquo;s find a pattern for powers of 6 modulo 11:</p><p>$ 6^1 \equiv 6 \pmod{11} $</p><p>$ 6^2 \equiv 36 \equiv 3 \pmod{11} $</p><p>$ 6^3 \equiv 18 \equiv 7 \pmod{11} $</p><p>$ 6^4 \equiv 42 \equiv 9 \pmod{11} $</p><p>$ 6^5 \equiv 54 \equiv 10 \pmod{11} $</p><p>$ 6^6 \equiv 60 \equiv 5 \pmod{11} $</p><p>$ 6^7 \equiv 30 \equiv 8 \pmod{11} $</p><p>$ 6^8 \equiv 48 \equiv 4 \pmod{11} $</p><p>Therefore, $ 2019^8 + 1 \equiv 4 + 1 \equiv 5 \pmod{11} $, so 11 does not divide $ 2019^8 + 1 $.</p><p>Continuing this process seems tedious. Maybe there&rsquo;s a better way to approach this problem.</p><p>Let me think differently. Perhaps I can consider the expression $ 2019^8 + 1 $ and see if it can be expressed in a form that reveals its prime factors.</p><p>I recall that for expressions like $ a^4 + 4b^4 $, there&rsquo;s a Sophie Germain identity: $ a^4 + 4b^4 = (a^2 + 2ab + 2b^2)(a^2 - 2ab + 2b^2) $. Maybe I can manipulate $ 2019^8 + 1 $ into a similar form.</p><p>Wait, $ 2019^8 + 1 = (2019^4)^2 + 1^2 $. This resembles the sum of squares, but over integers, sums of squares don&rsquo;t factor nicely. Maybe I can consider complex numbers or some other algebraic identities, but that might not help in finding integer prime factors.</p><p>Alternatively, perhaps I can consider modulo properties to find possible prime factors. For example, if $ p $ is an odd prime that divides $ 2019^8 + 1 $, then $ 2019^8 \equiv -1 \pmod{p} $, which implies $ 2019^{16} \equiv 1 \pmod{p} $. This means that the order of 2019 modulo $ p $ divides 16, and since $ 2019^8 \equiv -1 \pmod{p} $, the order can&rsquo;t divide 8. Therefore, the order must be 16.</p><p>By Fermat&rsquo;s Little Theorem, the order of 2019 modulo $ p $ divides $ p - 1 $. Therefore, $ p - 1 $ must be divisible by 16. So, $ p \equiv 1 \pmod{16} $.</p><p>This narrows down the possible primes $ p $ that could divide $ 2019^8 + 1 $ to those primes congruent to 1 modulo 16.</p><p>Let me list some primes that are 1 modulo 16: 17, 97, 113, 193, 241, 257, etc.</p><p>Now, I can test these primes to see if any of them divide $ 2019^8 + 1 $.</p><p>Start with 17. Compute $ 2019 $ modulo 17.</p><p>First, find $ 2019 \div 17 $. 17 times 118 is 2006, so $ 2019 - 2006 = 13 $. Therefore, $ 2019 \equiv 13 \pmod{17} $.</p><p>Then, $ 2019^8 \equiv 13^8 \pmod{17} $.</p><p>Compute $ 13^2 \equiv 169 \equiv 16 \pmod{17} $</p><p>$ 13^4 = (13^2)^2 \equiv 16^2 \equiv 256 \equiv 1 \pmod{17} $</p><p>$ 13^8 = (13^4)^2 \equiv 1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{17} $</p><p>Therefore, $ 2019^8 + 1 \equiv 1 + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{17} $, so 17 does not divide $ 2019^8 + 1 $.</p><p>Next, check 97. Compute $ 2019 $ modulo 97.</p><p>First, find how many times 97 fits into 2019. 97 times 20 is 1940, and 2019 - 1940 = 79. So, $ 2019 \equiv 79 \pmod{97} $.</p><p>Then, $ 2019^8 \equiv 79^8 \pmod{97} $.</p><p>This seems a bit cumbersome to compute directly. Maybe I can find a pattern or use Fermat&rsquo;s Little Theorem, which states that $ a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p} $ if $ p $ is prime and $ p $ does not divide $ a $.</p><p>Here, $ p = 97 $, so $ 79^{96} \equiv 1 \pmod{97} $. But I need $ 79^8 $, which is not directly helpful. Maybe I can compute $ 79^2 $, then $ 79^4 $, and so on.</p><p>First, compute $ 79^2 \pmod{97} $:</p><p>$ 79^2 = 6241 $. Now, divide 6241 by 97.</p><p>97 times 64 is 6208, so 6241 - 6208 = 33. Therefore, $ 79^2 \equiv 33 \pmod{97} $.</p><p>Next, $ 79^4 = (79^2)^2 \equiv 33^2 \pmod{97} $.</p><p>$ 33^2 = 1089 $. 97 times 11 is 1067, so 1089 - 1067 = 22. Therefore, $ 79^4 \equiv 22 \pmod{97} $.</p><p>Then, $ 79^8 = (79^4)^2 \equiv 22^2 \pmod{97} $.</p><p>$ 22^2 = 484 $. 97 times 4 is 388, so 484 - 388 = 96. Therefore, $ 79^8 \equiv 96 \pmod{97} $.</p><p>Thus, $ 2019^8 + 1 \equiv 96 + 1 \equiv 97 \equiv 0 \pmod{97} $.</p><p>So, 97 divides $ 2019^8 + 1 $. Since 97 is the smallest prime congruent to 1 modulo 16 that we&rsquo;ve checked and it divides $ 2019^8 + 1 $, it must be the least odd prime factor of $ 2019^8 + 1 $.</p><p>Therefore, the least odd prime factor is 97.</p><p><strong>Final Answer</strong></p><p>$$ \boxed{97} $$</p></div></div></div></div><h1 id=reflections-on-the-journey-ahead>Reflections on the Journey Ahead<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#reflections-on-the-journey-ahead>#</a></h1><p>The path to understanding reasoning in large language models branches into many directions, each offering unique insights into the nature of machine intelligence.

The model achieves <strong>100%</strong> accuracy in the 1M length Passkey Retrieval task and scores <strong>93.1</strong> on the long text evaluation benchmark RULER, surpassing GPT-4&rsquo;s 91.6 and GLM4-9B-1M&rsquo;s 89.9. Additionally, the model maintains very strong competitiveness in short sequence capabilities, on par with GPT-4o-mini.</li><li><strong>Faster Inference Speed</strong>: Using sparse attention mechanisms, we successfully reduced the time to first token for processing a context of 1M tokens from 4.9 minutes to 68 seconds, <strong>achieving a 4.3x speedup</strong>.</li><li><strong>Lower Cost</strong>: The price remains ¥0.3 / 1M tokens. At the same cost, Qwen2.5-Turbo can process <strong>3.6 times the number of tokens</strong> as GPT-4o-mini.</li></ol><figure><img src=https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5-Turbo/cover_en.png#center width=100%></figure><p>Now, you can use it through the API service of <a href=https://help.aliyun.com/zh/model-studio/getting-started/what-is-model-studio>Alibaba Cloud Model Studio [Chinese]</a>, or through <a href=https://huggingface.co/spaces/Qwen/Qwen2.5-Turbo-1M-Demo>HuggingFace Demo</a> or <a href=https://www.modelscope.cn/studios/Qwen/Qwen2.5-Turbo-1M-Demo>ModelScope Demo</a>.</p><h1 id=demo>Demo<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#demo>#</a></h1><p>We have prepared some demos to showcase the new uses that Qwen2.5-Turbo can bring, covering deep understanding of long novels, repository-level code assistant, and reading multiple papers.</p><div class="full-width-container example-container"><div class=example-content><div class=title><span>Example: Understanding Long Novels</span> <a class=next-button>Next</a></div><div class=grid-layout><div class=role></div><div class=content><figure><video controls src=https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5-Turbo/case1_en.mp4></video></figure></div><div class=role>User</div><div class=content><p>[Upload the three Chinese novels of <code>The Three-Body Problem</code>, which contain 690k tokens.]</p><p>Provide a summary of the plots of these three novels in English</p></div><div class=role>Qwen2.5-Turbo</div><div class=content><p>The three novels you mentioned from the &ldquo;Earth&rsquo;s Past&rdquo; series are interconnected and form a trilogy that delves into the complex interactions between Earth and an alien civilization known as the Trisolarans.</p><p><strong>First Novel: &ldquo;Earth&rsquo;s Past&rdquo;</strong> In the first novel, the narrative focuses on the development of a top-secret project called &ldquo;Red Coast&rdquo; (红岸) initiated by the Chinese military. The protagonist, Ye Wenjie, is a scientist who discovers that the Trisolarans have begun listening to the universe. Her actions, particularly her decision to respond to the Trisolarans, drastically alter the course of human history. She sets up a powerful signal to send to the Trisolarans using the sun as an amplifier. This action marks the beginning of a new era where humanity faces a significant existential threat.</p><p><strong>Second Novel: &ldquo;Dark Forest&rdquo;</strong> The second novel, titled &ldquo;Dark Forest,&rdquo; delves into the concept of the &ldquo;Dark Forest Theory.&rdquo; According to this theory, the universe is a vast battlefield where civilizations must remain silent to avoid detection and subsequent destruction. The Trisolarans and humans engage in a complex strategic game, with the Trisolarans deploying advanced weapons known as &ldquo;water drops&rdquo; (水滴). These water drops are capable of destroying entire planets by disrupting their ecosystems. Meanwhile, humans develop their own strategies, including the &ldquo;Wall-Bearing Plan&rdquo; (面壁计划), which involves four individuals who devise plans to counter the Trisolaran threat without revealing their intentions to the outside world. The story follows one of these face-bearers, Luo Ji, as he struggles with the ethical implications of his mission.</p><p><strong>Third Novel: &ldquo;Death&rsquo;s End&rdquo;</strong> In &ldquo;Death&rsquo;s End,&rdquo; Luo Ji becomes the ultimate guardian of the Dark Forest Theory. He holds the key to the survival of both human and Trisolaran civilizations. However, his position as the guardian (执剑人) brings him immense personal struggle and psychological turmoil. As Luo Ji&rsquo;s time as the guardian nears its end, he must make a critical decision about the future of humanity. Meanwhile, the Trisolarans continue their efforts to colonize and assimilate other worlds. The novel explores the consequences of this decision and the broader impact on the universe. It also introduces a new element: the creation of micro-black holes (黑域) by humans, which could potentially isolate them from the rest of the universe. However, the effectiveness of this strategy is questioned when six of these micro-black holes begin to move and accelerate towards Earth. The trilogy as a whole explores themes of survival, technological advancement, and the ethical dilemmas faced by humanity in the face of extraterrestrial threats. Each novel builds upon the previous one, revealing more about the intricate relationship between the two civilizations and the universe they inhabit.</p></div></div></div><div class=example-content style=display:none><div class=title><span>Example: Understanding Repository</span> <a class=next-button>Next</a></div><div class=grid-layout><div class=role></div><div class=content><figure><video controls src=https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5-Turbo/case2.mp4></video></figure></div><div class=role>User</div><div class=content><p>[Upload a text file containing all code files from the <a href=https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen-Agent>Qwen-Agent</a> repository, which has a length of 133k tokens.]</p><p>Please read the codes carefully and ensure your response is comprehensive.

The existing context length extension methods often lead to significant performance degradation when processing short texts. Therefore, we have paid special attention to this issue when building Qwen2.5-Turbo, ensuring that the extension of context length almost does not affect the ability of short text understanding.</p><figure><img src=https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5-Turbo/short_result.png#center width=100%></figure><p>Results on short text benchmarks show that Qwen2.5-Turbo significantly surpasses previous open-source models with a context length of 1M tokens in most tasks; compared to GPT-4o-mini and Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct models, Qwen2.5-Turbo achieves similar performance in short text tasks while supporting 8 times the context length.</p><h2 id=inference-speed>Inference Speed<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#inference-speed>#</a></h2><p>We tested the TTFT (time to first token) for inputs of different lengths.

There are many unresolved challenges, such as the model&rsquo;s performance being more unstable in long sequence tasks, and the cost of inference making it difficult to use larger models. However, we will actively explore further alignment of human preferences in long sequences, optimize inference efficiency to reduce computation time, and attempt to launch larger and stronger long-context models. We look forward to sharing new progress in developing long-context models with you soon, so stay tuned!</p></div>

During this period, we have focused on creating smarter and more knowledgeable language models. Today, we are excited to introduce the latest addition to the Qwen family: <strong>Qwen2.5</strong>. We are announcing what might be the largest opensource release in history! Let&rsquo;s get the party started!</p><p>Our latest release features the LLMs <strong>Qwen2.5</strong>, along with specialized models for coding, <strong>Qwen2.5-Coder</strong>, and mathematics, <strong>Qwen2.5-Math</strong>.

Compared to Qwen2, Qwen2.5 has acquired significantly more knowledge (MMLU: 85+) and has greatly improved capabilities in coding (HumanEval 85+) and mathematics (MATH 80+). Additionally, the new models achieve significant improvements in instruction following, generating long texts (over 8K tokens), understanding structured data (e.g, tables), and generating structured outputs especially JSON. Qwen2.5 models are generally more resilient to the diversity of system prompts, enhancing role-play implementation and condition-setting for chatbots. Like Qwen2, the Qwen2.5 language models support up to <strong>128K</strong> tokens and can generate up to <strong>8K</strong> tokens. They also maintain multilingual support for over <strong>29</strong> languages, including Chinese, English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Italian, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Thai, Arabic, and more. Below, we provide basic information about the models and details of the supported languages.</p><p>The specialized expert language models, namely <strong>Qwen2.5-Coder</strong> for coding and <strong>Qwen2.5-Math</strong> for mathematics, have undergone substantial enhancements compared to their predecessors, CodeQwen1.5 and Qwen2-Math. Specifically, Qwen2.5-Coder has been trained on <strong>5.5 trillion</strong> tokens of code-related data, enabling even smaller coding-specific models to deliver competitive performance against larger language models on coding evaluation benchmarks. Meanwhile, Qwen2.5-Math supports both <strong>Chinese</strong> and <strong>English</strong> and incorporates various reasoning methods, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Program-of-Thought (PoT), and Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR).</p><figure><img src=http://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5/Qwen2.5%20modelcard.001.jpeg alt="Qwen2.5 Specification" width=100%></figure><h1 id=performance>Performance<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#performance>#</a></h1><h2 id=qwen25>Qwen2.5<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#qwen25>#</a></h2><p>To showcase Qwen2.5&rsquo;s capabilities, we benchmark our largest open-source model, <strong>Qwen2.5-72B</strong> - a 72B-parameter dense decoder-only language model - against leading open-source models like Llama-3.1-70B and Mistral-Large-V2. We present comprehensive results from instruction-tuned versions across various benchmarks, evaluating both model capabilities and human preferences.</p><figure><img src=https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct-Score.jpg alt="Qwen2.5-72B Instruct Performance" width=100%></figure><p>Besides the instruction-tuned language models, we figure out that the base language model of our flagship opensource model Qwen2.5-72B reaches top-tier performance even against larger models like Llama-3-405B.</p><figure><img src=https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5/Qwen2.5-72B-base.001.jpeg alt="Qwen2.5-72B Base Model Performance" width=100%></figure><p>Furthermore, we benchmark the latest version of our API-based model, <strong>Qwen-Plus</strong>, against leading proprietary and open-source models, including GPT4-o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Llama-3.1-405B, and DeepSeek-V2.5. This comparison showcases Qwen-Plus&rsquo;s competitive standing in the current landscape of large language models. We show that <strong>Qwen-Plus</strong> significantly outcompetes DeepSeek-V2.5 and demonstrates competitive performance against Llama-3.1-405B, while still underperforming compared to GPT4-o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet in some aspects. This benchmarking not only highlights Qwen-Plus&rsquo;s strengths but also identifies areas for future improvement, reinforcing our commitment to continuous enhancement and innovation in the field of large language models.</p><figure><img src=https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5/qwen-plus-instruct.001.jpeg alt="Qwen-Plus Instruct Performance" width=100%></figure><p>A significant update in Qwen2.5 is the reintroduction of our 14B and 32B models, <strong>Qwen2.5-14B</strong> and <strong>Qwen2.5-32B</strong>. These models outperform baseline models of comparable or larger sizes, such as Phi-3.5-MoE-Instruct and Gemma2-27B-IT, across diverse tasks. They achieve an optimal balance between model size and capability, delivering performance that matches or exceeds some larger models. Additionally, our API-based model, <strong>Qwen-Turbo</strong>, offers highly competitive performance compared to the two open-source models, while providing a cost-effective and rapid service.</p><figure><img src=https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5/qwen2.5-32B-instruct_wturbo.001.jpeg alt="Qwen2.5-32B Instruct Performance" width=100%></figure><p>In recent times, there has been a notable shift towards small language models (SLMs). Although SLMs have historically trailed behind their larger counterparts (LLMs), the performance gap is rapidly diminishing. Remarkably, even models with just 3 billion parameters are now delivering highly competitive results. The accompanying figure illustrates a significant trend: newer models achieving scores above 65 in MMLU are increasingly smaller, underscoring the accelerated growth in knowledge density among language models. Notably, our <strong>Qwen2.5-3B</strong> stands out as a prime example, achieving impressive performance with only around 3 billion parameters, showcasing its efficiency and capability compared to its predecessors.</p><figure><img src=https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5/qwen2.5-small.jpg alt="Qwen2.5 Small Model" width=100%></figure><p>In addition to the notable enhancements in benchmark evaluations, we have refined our post-training methodologies. Our four key updates include support for long text generation of up to 8K tokens, significantly improved comprehension of structured data, more reliable generation of structured outputs, particularly in JSON format, and enhanced performance across diverse system prompts, which facilitates effective role-playing. Check the LLM blog for details about how to leverage these capabilities.</p><h2 id=qwen25-coder>Qwen2.5-Coder<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#qwen25-coder>#</a></h2><p>Since the launch of CodeQwen1.5, we have attracted numerous users who rely on this model for various coding tasks, such as debugging, answering coding-related questions, and providing code suggestions. Our latest iteration, Qwen2.5-Coder, is specifically designed for coding applications. In this section, we present the performance results of Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct, benchmarked against leading open-source models, including those with significantly larger parameter sizes.</p><figure><img src=https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5/Qwen2.5-Coder/coder-main.png alt="Qwen2.5-Coder Instruct Performance" width=100%></figure><p>We believe that Qwen2.5-Coder is an excellent choice as your personal coding assistant. Despite its smaller size, it outperforms many larger language models across a range of programming languages and tasks, demonstrating its exceptional coding capabilities.</p><h2 id=qwen25-math>Qwen2.5-Math<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#qwen25-math>#</a></h2><p>In terms of the math specific language models, we released the first models, Qwen2-Math, last month, and this time, compared to Qwen2-Math, Qwen2.5-Math has been pretrained larger-scale of math related data, including the synthetic data generated by Qwen2-Math. Additionally we extend the support of Chinese this time and we also strengthen its reasoning capabilities by endowing it with the abilities to perform CoT, PoT, and TIR. The general performance of Qwen2.5-Math-72B-Instruct surpasses both Qwen2-Math-72B-Instruct and GPT4-o, and even very small expert model like Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B-Instruct can achieve highly competitive performance against large language models.</p><figure><img src=http://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5/2024-08-qwen2.5-math-allsize.png alt="Qwen2.5 Math Performance Across All Sizes" width=100%></figure><h1 id=develop-with-qwen25>Develop with Qwen2.5<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#develop-with-qwen25>#</a></h1><p>The simplest way to use is through <a href>Hugging Face Transfomer</a> as demonstrated in the <a href=https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct>model card</a>:</p><div class=highlight><pre>from  transformers  import  AutoModelForCausalLM ,  AutoTokenizer

Our recent releases demonstrate our commitment to developing robust foundation models across language, vision-language, and audio-language domains. However, it is crucial to integrate these different modalities into a single model to enable seamless end-to-end processing of information across all three. Additionally, although we have made strides in enhancing reasoning capabilities through data scaling, we are inspired by the recent advancements in reinforcement learning (e.g., o1) and are dedicated to further improving our models&rsquo; reasoning abilities by scaling inference compute. We look forward to introducing you to the next generation of models soon! Stay tuned for more exciting developments!</p><h1 id=citation>Citation<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#citation>#</a></h1><p>We are going to release the technical report for Qwen2.5 very soon.

We have developed a range of decoder-only dense models, with seven of them open-sourced, spanning from 0.5B to 72B parameters. Our research indicates a significant interest among users in models within the 10-30B range for production use, as well as 3B models for mobile applications. To meet these demands, we are open-sourcing Qwen2.5-3B, Qwen2.5-14B, and Qwen2.5-32B. Furthermore, we are excited to offer additional models, including Qwen-Plus and Qwen-Turbo, available through API services via <a href=https://help.aliyun.com/zh/model-studio/developer-reference/what-is-qwen-llm>Alibaba Cloud Model Studio</a>.</p><p>Compared with the Qwen2 series, the Qwen2.5 series has the following upgrades:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Full-scale Open-source</strong>: Considering that users have a strong interest in models in the 10-30B range for production and 3B models for mobile applications, Qwen2.5, in addition to continuing to open source the four models of 0.5/1.5/7/72B of the same size as Qwen2, also added two medium-sized cost-effective models of <strong>Qwen2.5-14B</strong> and <strong>Qwen2.5-32B</strong> and a mobile-side model called <strong>Qwen2.5-3B</strong>. All models are highly competitive compared to open-source models of the same level. For example, Qwen2.5-32B beats Qwen2-72B and Qwen2.5-14B outperforms Qwen2-57B-A14B in our comprehensive evaluations.</p></li><li><p><strong>Larger and Higher Quality Pre-training Dataset</strong>: The size of the pre-training dataset is expanded from 7 trillion tokens to a maximum of <strong>18 trillion</strong> tokens.</p></li><li><p><strong>Knowledge Enhancement</strong>: Qwen2.5 has acquired significantly more knowledge. On MMLU benchmarks, Qwen2.5-7/72B are improved from 70.3 to <strong>74.2</strong> and 84.2 to <strong>86.1</strong> compared to Qwen2-7/72B. We observe that Qwen2.5 also has significant improvements on the GPQA/MMLU-Pro/MMLU-redux/ARC-c benchmarks.</p></li><li><p><strong>Coding Enhancement</strong>: Thanks to the technical breakthrough of Qwen2.5-Coder, Qwen2.5 has greatly improved capabilities in coding. Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct achieves <strong>55.5</strong>, <strong>75.1</strong>, and <strong>88.2</strong> scores on LiveCodeBench (2305-2409), MultiPL-E and MBPP, respectively, outperforming Qwen2-72B-Instruct with 32.2, 69.2, and 80.2.</p></li><li><p><strong>Math Enhancement</strong>: After integrating Qwen2-math&rsquo;s technology, the mathematical ability of Qwen2.5 has also been rapidly improved. On the MATH benchmark, the scores of Qwen2.5-7B/72B-Instruct have been increased from 52.9/69.0 of Qwen2-7B/72B-Instruct to <strong>75.5/83.1</strong>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Better Human Preference</strong>: Qwen2.5 is capable of generating responses that align more closely with human preferences. Specifically, the Arena-Hard score for Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct has increased significantly from <strong>48.1</strong> to <strong>81.2</strong>, and the MT-Bench score has improved from <strong>9.12</strong> to <strong>9.35</strong>, compared to Qwen2-72B-Instruct.</p></li><li><p><strong>Other Core Capabilities Enhancement</strong>: Qwen2.5 achieves significant improvements in <strong>instruction following</strong>, <strong>generating long texts</strong> (increased from 1k to over <strong>8K tokens</strong>), <strong>understanding structured data</strong> (e.g., tables), and <strong>generating structured outputs</strong>, especially JSON. Furthermore, Qwen2.5 models are generally more resilient to the diversity of <strong>system prompts</strong>, enhancing <strong>role-play</strong> implementation and <strong>condition-setting</strong> for chatbots.</p></li></ol><h1 id=model-card>Model Card<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#model-card>#</a></h1><p>Here is a model card detailing the key parameters of the Qwen2.5 LLM models. This release includes seven open-sourced models with sizes ranging from 0.5B to 72B.

Since then, we have been working to enhance the coding model. Today, we are excited to announce the release of the next generation of open-source coding models, <strong>Qwen2.5-Coder</strong>, and officially rename CodeQwen to Qwen-Coder. We think &ldquo;Coder&rdquo; is more human-like and agile, reflecting our vision of it becoming a true coding partner in the future. Qwen2.5-Coder is part of the Qwen2.5 series, available in three model sizes: 1.5B, 7B, and a 32B version (coming soon).</p><p>This update focuses on two main improvements: scaling up the code training data and enhancing coding capabilities while maintaining strong performance in other core areas like math and general tasks.</p><p>💻 Code More: Qwen2.5-Coder builds on the strong Qwen2.5 and continues training on a larger scale of code data, including source code, text-code grounding data, and synthetic data, totaling 5.5 trillion tokens. This leads to significant improvements in code-related tasks.</p><p>📚 Learn More: While enhancing coding abilities, we aimed to retain strengths in math and general capabilities from base model. Therefore, Qwen2.5-Coder incorporates additional data on mathematics and general abilities, providing a comprehensive foundation for real-world applications like Code Agent.</p><h1 id=qwen25-coder-base-models>Qwen2.5-Coder: Base Models<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#qwen25-coder-base-models>#</a></h1><p>Qwen2.5-Coder supports up to 128K tokens of context, covers 92 programming languages, and has achieved remarkable improvements across various code-related evaluation tasks, including code generation, multi-programming code generation, code completion, and code repair. Notably, the open-source 7B version of Qwen2.5-Coder has even outperformed larger models like DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite and CodeStral-22B, making it one of the most powerful base code models available. Beyond code tasks, Qwen2.5-Coder also demonstrates competitive math capabilities in evaluations such as GSM8K and Math. For general tasks, evaluations on MMLU and ARC show that Qwen2.5-Coder has retained the general ability performance of Qwen2.5.</p><figure><img src=https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5/Qwen2.5-Coder/qwen2.5-coder-base.jpg#center width=100%></figure><h1 id=qwen25-coder-instruct-instruction-tuned-models>Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct: Instruction-Tuned Models<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#qwen25-coder-instruct-instruction-tuned-models>#</a></h1><p>Building on Qwen2.5-Coder, we fine-tuned it with instruction data, creating Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct.

We do not recommend using this series of models for other tasks.</b></div></blockquote><h1 id=introduction>Introduction<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#introduction>#</a></h1><p>A month ago, we released the first series of mathematical LLMs - <a href=https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2-math/>Qwen2-Math</a> - of our Qwen family. Today, we have upgraded it and open-sourced <strong>Qwen2.5-Math</strong> series, including base models <strong>Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B/7B/72B</strong>, instruction-tuned models <strong>Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B/7B/72B-Instruct</strong>, and mathematical reward model <strong>Qwen2.5-Math-RM-72B</strong>.</p><p>Unlike Qwen2-Math series which only supports using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to solve English math problems, Qwen2.5-Math series is expanded to support using both CoT and Tool-integrated Reasoning (TIR) to solve math problems in both Chinese and English. The Qwen2.5-Math series models have achieved significant performance improvements compared to the Qwen2-Math series models on the Chinese and English mathematics benchmarks with CoT.</p><figure><img src=http://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5/2024-08-qwen2.5-math-allsize.png#center width=100%></figure><p>While CoT plays a vital role in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, it faces challenges in achieving computational accuracy and handling complex mathematical or algorithmic reasoning tasks, such as finding the roots of a quadratic equation or computing the eigenvalues of a matrix. TIR can further improve the model&rsquo;s proficiency in precise computation, symbolic manipulation, and algorithmic manipulation. Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B/7B/72B-Instruct achieve 79.7, 85.3, and 87.8 respectively on the MATH benchmark using TIR.</p><figure><img src=http://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5/qwen2.5-math-pipeline.jpeg#center width=100%></figure><h2 id=qwen25-math-base-models>Qwen2.5-Math: Base Models<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#qwen25-math-base-models>#</a></h2><p>The overall specialization pipelines of Qwen2-Math and Qwen2.5-Math are shown in the figure above. After training of Qwen2-Math base models, we further upgrade them to Qwen2.5-Math models through three primary avenues:</p><ol><li><p>Utilizing Qwen2-Math-72B-Instruct models to synthesize additional high-quality mathematical pre-training data.</p></li><li><p>Aggregating more high-quality mathematical data, particularly in Chinese, from web sources, books, and codes across multiple recall cycles.</p></li><li><p>Leveraging the Qwen2.5 series base model for parameter initialization, which shows more powerful language understanding, code generation, and text reasoning capabilities.</p></li></ol><p>Ultimately, we construct <em>Qwen Math Corpus v2</em> for Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B/7B/72B pre-training, maintaining a context length of 4K. Compared to <em>Qwen Math Corpus v1</em> used for Qwen2-Math training, the total token count of <em>Qwen Math Corpus v2</em> has increased from 700B to over 1T.</p><p>We evaluate our Qwen2.5-Math base models on three widely used English math benchmarks GSM8K, Math, and MMLU-STEM. In addition, we also evaluate three Chinese math benchmarks CMATH, GaoKao Math Cloze, and GaoKao Math QA. All evaluations are tested with few-shot chain-of-thought prompting.</p><figure><img src=http://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5/qwen2.5-math-table.png#center width=100%></figure><p>Compared to Qwen2-Math-1.5B/7B/72B, Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B/7B/72B have achieved significant improvements on all benchmarks. For example, Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B/7B/72B obtains 5.4, 5.0, 6.3 scores improvement on MATH, and 3.4, 12.2, 19.8 scores improvement on Gaokao Math QA.</p><h2 id=qwen25-math-instruct-instruction-tuned-models>Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct: Instruction-Tuned Models<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#qwen25-math-instruct-instruction-tuned-models>#</a></h2><p>Similar to Qwen2-Math-Instruct, we train a math-specific reward model Qwen2.5-Math-RM-72B based on Qwen2.5-Math-72B. This RM is used for constructing the SFT data through Rejection Sampling and also in the reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) after SFT.</p><p>In the development of Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct, an additional iteration is conducted using the Qwen2-Math-Instruct models and Qwen2.5-Math-RM-72B to polish the quality of responses further during Rejection Sampling.</p><p>Compared with the post-training of Qwen2-Math, we further introduced TIR data and SFT data in Chinese and English for Qwen2.5 post-training.</p><p>We evaluate Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct on mathematical benchmarks in both English and Chinese. In addition to the widely-used benchmarks, such as GSM8K and Math, we also involve more exams that are more challenging to fully inspect the capabilities of Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct, such as OlympiadBench, CollegeMath, GaoKao, AIME2024, and AMC2023. For Chinese mathematical benchmarks, we use CMATH, Gaokao (Chinese College Entrance Examination 2024), and CN Middle School 24 (China High School Entrance Examination 2024).</p><p>We report greedy, Maj@8 and RM@8 performance on all benchmarks in the zero-shot setting, except for the multi-choice benchmarks (including MMLU STEM and multiple-choice problems in GaoKao and CN Middle School 24) with a 5-shot setting.</p><p>The Qwen2.5-Math-72B-Instruct model outperforms the Qwen2-Math-72B-Instruct model by an average margin of 4.4 and 6.1 points in English and Chinese, respectively, establishing itself as the best open-source mathematical model currently available.</p><p>The flagship model, Qwen2.5-Math-72B-Instruct, significantly outperforms both open-source models and leading closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini Math-Specialized 1.5 Pro). Under the TIR setting of RM@8, a high score of 92.9 was achieved on MATH.</p><p>With the aid of synthesized pre-training and supervised fine-tuning data from the 72B model, Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct surpasses Qwen2-Math-Instruct 72B in performance. Under CoT and TIR settings, it achieves MATH scores of 83.6 and 85.3, respectively.</p><p>Even our smallest 1.5B model, achieves a MATH score of around 80 when utilizing the Python Interpreter, outperforming the majority of current models in this domain.</p><figure><img src=http://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5/math_instruct_en.jpg#center width=120%></figure><figure><img src=http://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5/math_instruct_zh.jpg#center width=90%></figure><p>In more complex mathematical competition evaluations such as AIME 2024 and AMC 2023, Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct also performs well across various settings, including Greedy, Maj@64, RM@64, and RM@256.</p><p>With the support of the Qwen2.5-Math-RM-72B, Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B-Instruct, using the RM@256 in CoT mode, successfully solves 29 out of 40 problems on AMC 2023.</p><p>Moreover, Qwen2.5-Math-72B-Instruct nearly achieves a perfect score in TIR mode, solving almost all the problems.</p><p>On the extremely difficult AIME 2024 benchmark, Claude3 Opus, GPT-4 Turbo, and Gemini 1.5 Pro manage to solve only 1 or 2 questions out of 30.</p><p>In contrast, Qwen2.5-Math-72B-Instruct solves 9 problems in Greedy decoding CoT mode and 12 problems in TIR mode. With the help of the RM, Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct could even solve up to 21 problems, further demonstrating the outstanding mathematical problem-solving ability of Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct.</p><figure><img src=http://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5/math_instruct_aime.jpg#center width=80%></figure><h2 id=decontamination>Decontamination<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#decontamination>#</a></h2><p>Decontamination is critical to ensuring unbiased model performance evaluation.</p><p>Following prior work Qwen2, we exclude potentially contaminated training samples using 13-gram matching. To improve the accuracy of this matching process, we perform text normalization, removing irrelevant punctuation and symbols.</p><p>To further reduce false negatives, particularly for common mathematical expressions, we introduce an additional criterion: the ratio of the longest common subsequence must exceed $0.6$ for a sample to be considered contaminated.</p><p>For pre-training data, we filter potentially contaminated samples against datasets such as GSM8K and MATH. When dealing with post-training data, including SFT data, RM training data, and the RL query set, we exclude any potentially contaminated problems or solutions across all reported evaluation datasets. These evaluation datasets include GSM8K, MATH, Minerva Math, Gaokao 2023 En, Olympiad Bench, College Math, MMLU STEM, GaoKao, CMATH, CN Middle School 24, AIME 24, and AMC 23.</p><p>During the analysis of contaminated samples, we identify that some existing training datasets (e.g., the MATH training dataset) contain a significant proportion of problems that share highly similar concepts or structures with those found in test datasets. Although these variations are not exact duplicates, they could potentially compromise the integrity of our evaluation. Therefore, we continue to exclude such samples from the training corpora.</p><h2 id=demo>Demo<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#demo>#</a></h2><p>We develop a demo that supports the TIR mode in <a href=https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen-Agent>Qwen-Agent</a>, which allows running code locally to experience Tool-Integrated Reasoning capabilities of Qwen2.5-Math.</p><figure><img src=http://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5/qwen2.5-math-example1.png#center width=80%></figure><p>Furthermore, we provide a multi-modal mathematic demo in <a href=https://huggingface.co/spaces/Qwen/Qwen2-Math-Demo>Huggingface</a> and <a href=https://www.modelscope.cn/studios/qwen/Qwen-Math-demo>Modelscope</a>. This WebUI is based on Qwen2-VL for OCR and Qwen2-Math for mathematical reasoning. You can input either images, texts, or sketches of mathematical and arithmetic problems.</p><h2 id=summary>Summary<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#summary>#</a></h2><p>We introduce Qwen2.5-Math, which features several key technical highlights:</p><p>(1) Extensive using of synthesized mathematical data from Qwen2-Math during the pre-training phase.</p><p>(2) Iterative generation of fine-tuning data and reinforcement training guided by the reward model during the post-training phase.</p><p>(3) Supporting for bilingual (English and Chinese) queries, along with chain-of-thought and tool-integrated reasoning capabilities.</p><p>As a result, Qwen2.5-Math represents the most advanced open-source math model series to date. The Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B-Instruct model already surpasses most previous 70B math models, while the Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct matches the performance of Qwen2-Math-72B-Instruct. Our flagship model, Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct, outperforms Qwen2-Math-72B-Instruct with an average score increase of 4.7 points across 7 tasks.</p><p>We hope that the advances we’ve made with specialized models like Qwen2.5-Math will continue to strengthen the overall capabilities of the Qwen model and bring us closer to achieving artificial general intelligence.</p></div>

Another important result is Proposition 3.16, which establishes an inequality for any exact limit linear series. Specifically, our Proposition 3.16 says:</p></li></ol><p>Let ${(\mathcal{L}_{\underline{d}}, V_{\underline{d}})}_{\underline{d}}$ be an exact limit linear series of degree $d$ and dimension $r$. Then $$ \sum_{\underline{d}} \dim \left( \frac{V_{\underline{d}}}{V_{\underline{d}}^{X_1, 0} + V_{\underline{d}}^{X_2, 0} + V_{\underline{d}}^{X_3, 0}} \right) \geq r + 1. $$</p><p>As a consequence of Proposition 3.14 and Proposition 3.16, in Corollary 3.17, we get the following characterization of exact limit linear series satisfying the distributivity at each multidegree:</p><p>Let ${(\mathcal{L}_{\underline{d}}, V_{\underline{d}})}_{\underline{d}}$ be an exact limit linear series of degree $d$ and dimension $r$. Then $$ \sum_{\underline{d}} \dim \left( \frac{V_{\underline{d}}}{V_{\underline{d}}^{X_1, 0} + V_{\underline{d}}^{X_2, 0} + V_{\underline{d}}^{X_3, 0}} \right) = r + 1 $$ if and only if the distributivity holds in $V_{\underline{d}}$ for any $\underline{d}$.</p><p>In Section 3, we also study simple limit linear series. In Proposition 3.18, we characterize the multidegrees which determine all simple bases. In Proposition 3.20, following the construction in Muñoz [5], Proposition 4.4, we present a certain structure of linearly independent sections for any exact limit linear series satisfying the distributivity property. In propositions 3.21 and 3.22, we obtain some properties of that structure. These properties imply the existence of a simple basis (we give a proof of that in Proposition 3.23).</p><p>We conclude Section 3 with a characterization of simple limit linear series among the exact limit linear series. Specifically, our Corollary 3.24 says:</p><p>Let ${(\mathcal{L}_{\underline{d}}, V_{\underline{d}})}_{\underline{d}}$ be an exact limit linear series of degree $d$ and dimension $r$. Then the following statements are equivalent:</p><ol><li>${(\mathcal{L}_{\underline{d}}, V_{\underline{d}})}_{\underline{d}}$ is simple.</li><li>$\sum_{\underline{d}} \dim \left( \frac{V_{\underline{d}}}{V_{\underline{d}}^{X_1, 0} + V_{\underline{d}}^{X_2, 0} + V_{\underline{d}}^{X_3, 0}} \right) = r + 1$.</li><li>The distributivity holds in $V_{\underline{d}}$ for any $\underline{d}$.</li></ol><p>In a subsequent work, given a refined limit linear series, we will construct all simple extensions by combining our Proposition 3.14 and the method of Muñoz [6] for the construction of all exact extensions.</p></div></div></div><div class=example-content style=display:none><div class=title><span>Example: Multilingual Text Recognition</span> <a class=next-button>Next</a></div><div class=grid-layout><div class=role>User</div><div class=content>转录图中内容，并识别图中每段内容的语言。 <img loading=lazy src=https://qianwen-res.oss-accelerate-overseas.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2-VL/screenshot_multilingual4.png alt=image></div><div class=role>Qwen2-VL</div><div class=content><ol><li><p>汉语，也称为“华语”。是中国使用人数最多的语言，也是世界上作为第一语言使用人数最多的语言。是中华优秀传统文化的重要载体。繁体字，又稱為“繁體中文”，與“簡化字”/“簡體字”相對。一般是指漢字簡化運動被簡化字所代替的漢字。</p><ul><li>语言：中文</li></ul></li><li><p>日本語は地方ごとに多様な方言があり、とりわけ琉球諸島で方言差が著しい。</p><ul><li>语言：日语</li></ul></li><li><p>한국어(韓國語), 조선말(朝鮮말)는 대한민국과 조선민주주의인민공화국의 공용어이다. 둘은 표기나 문법에서는 차이가 없지만 동사 어미나 표현에서 차이가 있다.</p><ul><li>语言：韩语</li></ul></li><li><p>Le français est une langue indo-européenne de la famille des langues romanes dont les locuteurs sont appelés « francophones ».</p><ul><li>语言：法语</li></ul></li><li><p>El español o castellano es una lengua romance procedente del latín hablado, perteneciente a la familia de lenguas indoeuropeas.</p><ul><li>语言：西班牙语</li></ul></li><li><p>A língua portuguesa, também designada português, é uma língua indo-europeia românica flexiva ocidental originada no galego-português falado no Reino da Galiza e no norte de Portugal.</p><ul><li>语言：葡萄牙语</li></ul></li><li><p>Is ceann de na teangacha Ceilteacha í an Ghaeilge (nó Gaeilge na hÉireann mar a thugtar uirthi corruair), agus ceann de na trí cinn de theangacha Ceilteacha ar a dtugtar na teangacha Gaelacha (Gaeilge, Gaeilge Mhanann agus Gaeilge na hAlban) go háirithe.</p><ul><li>语言：爱尔兰语</li></ul></li><li><p>English is a West Germanic language in the Indo-European language family, whose speakers, called Anglophones, originated in early medieval England on the island of Great Britain.</p><ul><li>语言：英语</li></ul></li><li><p>Die deutsche Sprache bzw.

For example, the model is unable to extract audio from videos, and its knowledge is only up to date as of June 2023. Additionally, the model cannot guarantee complete accuracy when processing complex instructions or scenarios, and it is relatively weak in tasks involving counting, character recognition, and 3D spatial awareness.</p><h2 id=model-architecture>Model Architecture<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#model-architecture>#</a></h2><p>Overall, we&rsquo;ve continued with the Qwen-VL architecture, which leverages a Vision Transformer (ViT) model and Qwen2 language models. For all these variants, we utilized a ViT with approximately 600M parameters, designed to handle both image and video inputs seamlessly. To further enhance the model&rsquo;s ability to effectively perceive and comprehend visual information in videos, we introduced several key upgrades:</p><ul><li>A key architectural improvement in Qwen2-VL is the implementation of <strong>Naive Dynamic Resolution support</strong>. Unlike its predecessor, Qwen2-VL can handle arbitrary image resolutions, mapping them into a dynamic number of visual tokens, thereby ensuring consistency between the model input and the inherent information in images. This approach more closely mimics human visual perception, allowing the model to process images of any clarity or size.</li></ul><figure><img src=https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2-VL/qwen2_vl.jpg#center width=90%></figure><ul><li>Another key architectural enhancement is the innovation of <strong>Multimodal Rotary Position Embedding (M-ROPE)</strong>. By deconstructing the original rotary embedding into three parts representing temporal and spatial (height and width) information，M-ROPE enables LLM to concurrently capture and integrate 1D textual, 2D visual, and 3D video positional information.</li></ul><figure><img src=https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2-VL/mrope.png#center width=90%></figure><h2 id=developing-with-qwen2-vl>Developing with Qwen2-VL<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#developing-with-qwen2-vl>#</a></h2><p>To use the largest Qwen2-VL model, Qwen2-VL-72B, you can access it through our official API (sign up the account and obtain the API key through <a href=https://dashscope.aliyun.com/>DashScope</a>) temporarily as demonstrated below:</p><div class=highlight><pre>from  openai  import  OpenAI

Thanks to the rapid development of large language models, LLMs are now capable of understanding language and reasoning. Previously we have taken a step forward to extend our LLM, i.e., Qwen, to more modalities, including vision and audio, and built Qwen-VL and Qwen-Audio. Today, we release Qwen2-Audio, the next version of Qwen-Audio, which is capable of accepting audio and text inputs and generating text outputs. Qwen2-Audio has the following features:</p><ul><li><p>Voice Chat: for the first time, users can use the voice to give instructions to the audio-language model without ASR modules.</p></li><li><p>Audio Analysis: the model is capable of analyzing audio information, including speech, sound, music, etc., with text instructions.</p></li><li><p>Multilingual: the model supports more than 8 languages and dialects, e.g., Chinese, English, Cantonese, French, Italian, Spanish, German, and Japanese.</p></li></ul><br><p>We open-weight Qwen2-Audio-7B and Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct in Hugging Face and ModelScope, and we have built a demo for users to interact with. Below are some examples to show the model performance:</p><style>.example-content .grid-layout{display:grid;grid-template-columns:1fr;row-gap:var(--content-gap)}.example-container{width:100%;padding:0;margin:0}.grid-layout{display:flex;flex-direction:column;width:100%;grid-template-columns:1fr}.message{display:flex;flex-direction:column;align-items:flex-start;width:100%}.role{font-weight:700;margin-right:5px;white-space:nowrap}.content{display:flex;align-items:center;white-space:pre-wrap;width:100%;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:50px}.wide-content{width:100%}.audio-icon{flex-shrink:0;margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:10px}.text-content{width:90%;white-space:pre-wrap;margin-top:10px}audio{vertical-align:middle}</style><h3 id=voice-chat>Voice Chat<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#voice-chat>#</a></h3><div class="full-width-container example-container"><div class=example-content><div class=title><span>Voice Chat: Identify speaker information and respond</span> <a class=next-button>Next</a></div><div class=grid-layout><div class=message><div class=role>User</div><div class="content wide-content"><div class=text-content><audio class=audio-icon controls><source src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2-Audio/demo/guess age.wav" type=audio/wav>Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio></div></div></div><div class=message><div class=role>Qwen2-Audio</div><div class="content wide-content"><div class=text-content>Yes, the speaker is female and in her twenties.</div></div></div><div class=message><div class=role>User</div><div class="content wide-content"><div class=text-content><audio class=audio-icon controls><source src=https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2-Audio/demo/1718857224593-3efbd24f-f7f8-4f10-abba-24df5d92210b.wav type=audio/wav>Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio></div></div></div><div class=message><div class=role>Qwen2-Audio</div><div class="content wide-content"><div class=text-content>I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling stressed about your exam. It's completely normal to feel anxious when you're preparing for an important test. Here are some tips that might help you: &nbsp 1. Start studying early: Don't leave everything until the last minute. Break up your study sessions into smaller chunks of time, and try to stick to a regular schedule. 2. Find a quiet place to study: A quiet environment can help you concentrate better. If possible, find a library or a study room where you can work without distractions. 3.Take breaks: It's important to take breaks during your study sessions. This will give your brain a chance to rest and recharge. Try taking short breaks every hour or so. 4. Get enough sleep: Lack of sleep can make it harder to focus and retain information. Make sure you're getting enough sleep each night, ideally around 7-8 hours. 5. Practice relaxation techniques: Deep breathing exercises, meditation, or yoga can all help you relax and reduce stress. &nbsp Remember, it's okay if you're not feeling well-prepared. Just do your best, and trust yourself. Good luck with your exam!</div></div></div></div></div><div class=example-content style=display:none><div class=title><span>Voice Chat: Speech translation</span> <a class=next-button>Next</a></div><div class=grid-layout><div class=message><div class=role>User</div><div class="content wide-content"><div class=text-content><audio class=audio-icon controls><source src=https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2-Audio/demo/1718864196340-99f0394d-7d0b-4b4b-b86a-4d8f3a2ac09c.wav type=audio/wav>Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio></div></div></div><div class=message><div class=role>Qwen2-Audio</div><div class="content wide-content"><div class=text-content>每个人都希望被欣赏，所以如果你欣赏某人，不要把它保密。</div></div></div><div class=message><div class=role>User</div><div class="content wide-content"><div class=text-content><audio class=audio-icon controls><source src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2-Audio/demo/translate it into German.wav" type=audio/wav>Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio></div></div></div><div class=message><div class=role>Qwen2-Audio</div><div class="content wide-content"><div class=text-content>Jeder möchte geschätzt werden, also wenn du jemanden schätzt, lass es nicht als Geheimnis verbergen.</div></div></div><div class=message><div class=role>User</div><div class="content wide-content"><div class=text-content><audio class=audio-icon controls><source src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2-Audio/demo/how about into French.wav" type=audio/wav>Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio></div></div></div><div class=message><div class=role>Qwen2-Audio</div><div class="content wide-content"><div class=text-content>Chacun veut être apprecié, alors si tu apprécies quelqu'un, ne le gardes pas secret.</div></div></div><div class=message><div class=role>User</div><div class="content wide-content"><div class=text-content><audio class=audio-icon controls><source src=https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2-Audio/demo/给我生成一些类似这句话意思的，其他说法的句子，用中文生成.wav type=audio/wav>Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio></div></div></div><div class=message><div class=role>Qwen2-Audio</div><div class="content wide-content"><div class=text-content>1. 每个人都喜欢被赞美，所以如果你喜欢一个人，不要隐藏你的赞赏。 2. 所有人都渴望得到认可，因此如果你欣赏某人，请不要独自享用这种感觉。 3. 人们都希望被欣赏，所以如果你喜欢某人，不要独自保密欣赏他人是一种美德，所以不要让别人知道你对他们的赞赏是秘密的。 4. 人们都希望受到赞扬，所以如果你欣赏某人，不妨公开表达出来。 5. 如果你喜欢某人，不要犹豫告诉他们，因为每个人都有权利享受他人的赞赏。</div></div></div></div></div><div class=example-content style=display:none><div class=title><span>Voice Chat: Detecting background noise and responding accordingly</span> <a class=next-button>Next</a></div><div class=grid-layout><div class=message><div class=role>User</div><div class="content wide-content"><div class=text-content><audio class=audio-icon controls><source src=https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2-Audio/demo/audio-0-100.wav.wav type=audio/wav>Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio></div></div></div><div class=message><div class=role>Qwen2-Audio</div><div class="content wide-content"><div class=text-content>Use headphones to block out external noise and find a quiet place to study.

This can help calm your mind and body. 2. Find a safe place: If possible, move to a safe location away from the source of the fear. If you're in a car, pull over to a parking lot or a safe spot on the side of the road. 3. Stay informed: If you have access to information about the situation, stay informed but don't overdo it. Too much information can create more anxiety. 4. Talk to someone: Talking to someone you trust can help you process your feelings and gain perspective. You can call a friend, family member, or even a professional counselor if needed. 5.

We will release bilingual (English and Chinese) math models soon.</b></div></blockquote><h1 id=introduction>Introduction<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#introduction>#</a></h1><p>Over the past year, we have dedicated significant effort to researching and enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models, with a particular focus on their ability to solve arithmetic and mathematical problems. Today, we are delighted to introduce a series of <strong>math-specific</strong> large language models of our Qwen2 series, Qwen2-Math and Qwen2-Math-Instruct-1.5B/7B/72B. Qwen2-Math is a series of specialized math language models built upon the Qwen2 LLMs, which significantly outperforms the mathematical capabilities of open-source models and even closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4o). We hope that Qwen2-Math can contribute to the community for solving complex mathematical problems.</p><p>We evaluate our math-specific models on a series of math benchmarks. The results below demonstrate that our largest math-specific model Qwen2-Math-72B-Instruct outperforms the state-of-the-art models, including GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Gemini-1.5-Pro, and Llama-3.1-405B.</p><figure><img src=https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/assets/blog/qwen2-math/fig2.jpg#center width=100%></figure><h2 id=qwen2-math-base-models>Qwen2-Math: Base Models<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#qwen2-math-base-models>#</a></h2><p>The base models of Qwen2-Math are initialized with Qwen2-1.5B/7B/72B, and then pretrained on a meticulously designed Mathematics-specific Corpus. This corpus contains large-scale high-quality mathematical web texts, books, codes, exam questions, and mathematical pre-training data synthesized by Qwen2.</p><p>We evaluate our Qwen2-Math base models on three widely used English math benchmarks GSM8K, Math, and MMLU-STEM. In addition, we also evaluate three Chinese math benchmarks CMATH, GaoKao Math Cloze, and GaoKao Math QA. All evaluations are tested with few-shot chain-of-thought prompting.</p><figure><img src=https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/assets/blog/qwen2-math/Base-Table1.png#center width=90%></figure><h2 id=qwen2-math-instruct-instruction-tuned-models>Qwen2-Math-Instruct: Instruction-Tuned Models<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#qwen2-math-instruct-instruction-tuned-models>#</a></h2><p>We first trained a math-specific reward model based on Qwen2-Math-72B. We then combined this dense reward signal with a binary signal indicating whether the model answered correctly. This combined signal is used as supervision for constructing the SFT data through Rejection Sampling and also in the reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) after SFT.</p><p>We evaluate Qwen2-Math-Instruct on mathematical benchmarks in both English and Chinese. In addition to the widely-used benchmarks, such as GSM8K and Math, we also involve more exams that are much challenging to fully inspect the capabilities of Qwen2-Math-Instruct, such as OlympiadBench, CollegeMath, GaoKao, AIME2024, and AMC2023. For Chinese mathematical benchmarks, we use CMATH, Gaokao (Chinese college entrance examination 2024), and CN Middle School 24 (China High School Entrance Examination 2024).</p><p>We report greedy , Maj@8 and RM@8 performance on all benchmarks in the zero-shot setting, except for the multi-choice benchmarks (including MMLU STEM and multiple-choice problems in GaoKao and CN Middle School 24) with a 5-shot setting. Qwen2-Math-Instruct achieves the best performance among models of the same size, with RM@8 outperforming Maj@8, particularly in the 1.5B and 7B models. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our math reward model.</p><figure><img src=https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/assets/blog/qwen2-math/Instruct-Table1.png#center width=100%></figure><p>In more complex mathematical competition evaluations such as AIME 2024 and AMC 2023, Qwen2-Math-Instruct also performs well across various settings, including Greedy, Maj@64, RM@64, and RM@256.</p><figure><img src=https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/assets/blog/qwen2-math/Instruct-Table2.png#center width=70%></figure><h2 id=case-study>Case Study<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#case-study>#</a></h2><p>Here we list some test cases, which include some IMO math problems.

We need to find the smallest $ t $ for which the sum of $ t $ cubes equals $ 2002^{2002} $.</p><p>First, we note that $ 2002 $ can be factored into prime factors:</p><p>$$ 2002 = 2 \times 7 \times 11 \times 13. $$</p><p>Thus,</p><p>$$ 2002^{2002} = (2 \times 7 \times 11 \times 13)^{2002} = 2^{2002} \times 7^{2002} \times 11^{2002} \times 13^{2002}. $$</p><p>Next, we consider the properties of cubes modulo 9. Cubes modulo 9 can only be congruent to $ 0, 1, $ or $ -1 $. This is because:</p><p>$$ \begin{aligned} 0^3 &\equiv 0 \pmod{9}, \\\ 1^3 &\equiv 1 \pmod{9}, \\\ 2^3 &\equiv 8 \equiv -1 \pmod{9}, \\\ 3^3 &\equiv 27 \equiv 0 \pmod{9}, \\\ 4^3 &\equiv 64 \equiv 1 \pmod{9}, \\\ 5^3 &\equiv 125 \equiv -1 \pmod{9}, \\\ 6^3 &\equiv 216 \equiv 0 \pmod{9}, \\\ 7^3 &\equiv 343 \equiv 1 \pmod{9}, \\\ 8^3 &\equiv 512 \equiv -1 \pmod{9}. \end{aligned} $$</p><p>Now, we need to determine $ 2002^{2002} \mod 9 $. First, we find $ 2002 \mod 9 $:</p><p>$$ 2002 \div 9 = 222 \text{ remainder } 4 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2002 \equiv 4 \pmod{9}. $$</p><p>Thus,</p><p>$$ 2002^{2002} \equiv 4^{2002} \pmod{9}. $$</p><p>Next, we use Euler&rsquo;s theorem, which states that $ a^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \pmod{n} $ for $ \gcd(a, n) = 1 $. Here, $ \phi(9) = 6 $, so:</p><p>$$ 4^6 \equiv 1 \pmod{9}. $$</p><p>We can reduce the exponent $ 2002 \mod 6 $:</p><p>$$ 2002 \div 6 = 333 \text{ remainder } 4 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2002 \equiv 4 \pmod{6}. $$</p><p>Thus,</p><p>$$ 4^{2002} \equiv 4^4 \pmod{9}. $$</p><p>$$ 4^4 = 256. $$</p><p>Finally, we find $ 256 \mod 9 $:</p><p>$$ 256 \div 9 = 28 \text{ remainder } 4 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 256 \equiv 4 \pmod{9}. $$</p><p>Therefore,</p><p>$$ 2002^{2002} \equiv 4 \pmod{9}. $$</p><p>We need to find the smallest $ t $ such that the sum of $ t $ cubes is congruent to 4 modulo 9. The possible sums of cubes modulo 9 are:</p><p>$$ \begin{aligned} 0 &\equiv 0 \pmod{9}, \\\ 1 &\equiv 1 \pmod{9}, \\\ -1 &\equiv 8 \pmod{9}, \\\ 1 + 1 &\equiv 2 \pmod{9}, \\\ 1 + (-1) &\equiv 0 \pmod{9}, \\\ -1 + (-1) &\equiv -2 \equiv 7 \pmod{9}, \\\ 1 + 1 + 1 &\equiv 3 \pmod{9}, \\\ 1 + 1 + (-1) &\equiv 1 \pmod{9}, \\\ 1 + (-1) + (-1) &\equiv -1 \equiv 8 \pmod{9}, \\\ -1 + (-1) + (-1) &\equiv -3 \equiv 6 \pmod{9}, \\\ 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 &\equiv 4 \pmod{9}. \end{aligned} $$</p><p>We see that the sum of four cubes can be congruent to 4 modulo 9. Therefore, the smallest $ t $ is 4.</p><p>Thus, the smallest positive integer $ t $ such that there exist integers $ x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_t $ with</p><p>$$ x_1^3 + x_2^3 + \cdots + x_t^3 = 2002^{2002} $$</p><p>is</p><p>$$ \boxed{4}. $$</p></details><details><summary>Problem From IMO Shortlist 2022</summary><p><strong>Problem</strong></p><p>For a positive integer $n$ we denote by $s(n)$ the sum of the digits of $n$. Let $P(x)=x^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\cdots+a_1x+a_0$ be a polynomial, where $n \geqslant 2$ and $a_i$ is a positive integer for all $ 0 \leqslant i \leqslant n-1$. Could it be the case that, for all positive integers $k$, $s(k)$ and $s(P(k))$ have the same parity?</p><p><strong>Qwen2-Math-72B-Instruct Solution</strong></p><p>To determine whether it is possible for $ s(k) $ and $ s(P(k)) $ to have the same parity for all positive integers $ k $, we need to analyze the behavior of the sum of the digits function $ s $ and the polynomial $ P(x) $.</p><p>First, recall that the sum of the digits of a number $ k $ modulo 2 is equivalent to $ k \mod 2 $. This is because the sum of the digits of $ k $ in base 10 is congruent to $ k \mod 9 $, and since $ 9 \equiv 1 \mod 2 $, the sum of the digits modulo 2 is the same as $ k \mod 2 $.</p><p>Given the polynomial $ P(x) = x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1x + a_0 $, we need to determine the parity of $ P(k) $ for any positive integer $ k $. Specifically, we need to check if $ P(k) \mod 2 $ is the same as $ k \mod 2 $.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s consider the polynomial modulo 2:</p><p>$$ P(x) \equiv x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1x + a_0 \mod 2. $$</p><p>Since $ a_i $ are positive integers, $ a_i \mod 2 $ is either 0 or 1. Let $ b_i = a_i \mod 2 $. Then we can rewrite the polynomial modulo 2 as:</p><p>$$ P(x) \equiv x^n + b_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \cdots + b_1x + b_0 \mod 2. $$</p><p>Now, we need to check the parity of $ P(k) $ for $ k \equiv 0 \mod 2 $ and $ k \equiv 1 \mod 2 $.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Case 1: $ k \equiv 0 \mod 2 $</strong></p><p>$$ P(0) \equiv b_0 \mod 2. $$</p><p>For $ s(P(0)) $ to have the same parity as $ s(0) $, $ b_0 $ must be 0. Therefore, $ a_0 $ must be even.</p></li><li><p><strong>Case 2: $ k \equiv 1 \mod 2 $</strong></p><p>$$ P(1) \equiv 1^n + b_{n-1} \cdot 1^{n-1} + \cdots + b_1 \cdot 1 + b_0 \equiv 1 + b_{n-1} + \cdots + b_1 + b_0 \mod 2. $$</p><p>For $ s(P(1)) $ to have the same parity as $ s(1) $, $ 1 + b_{n-1} + \cdots + b_1 + b_0 $ must be odd. Since $ 1 $ is odd, the sum $ b_{n-1} + \cdots + b_1 + b_0 $ must be even.</p></li></ol><p>From the above cases, we have:</p><ul><li>$ a_0 $ must be even.</li><li>The sum $ b_{n-1} + \cdots + b_1 + b_0 $ must be even.</li></ul><p>However, if $ a_0 $ is even, then $ b_0 = 0 $. This means the sum $ b_{n-1} + \cdots + b_1 $ must be even. But since $ b_i $ are either 0 or 1, the sum of $ b_{n-1} + \cdots + b_1 $ being even implies that there must be an even number of 1&rsquo;s among $ b_{n-1}, \ldots, b_1 $.</p><p>Now, consider the polynomial $ P(x) = x^n + 1 $. For this polynomial:</p><ul><li>$ a_0 = 1 $ (odd), which contradicts our requirement that $ a_0 $ must be even.</li><li>The sum $ b_{n-1} + \cdots + b_1 + b_0 = 1 $ (odd), which also contradicts our requirement that the sum must be even.</li></ul><p>Therefore, it is impossible for $ s(k) $ and $ s(P(k)) $ to have the same parity for all positive integers $ k $.</p><p>Thus, the final answer is:</p><p>$$ \boxed{\text{No}} $$</p></details><details><summary>Problem From IMO 2022</summary><p><strong>Problem</strong></p><p>Let $\mathbb{R}^+$ denote the set of positive real numbers.

The director selects $k$ students, where although each student&rsquo;s combination of courses is different, any two students have at least one course in common. At this point, it is found that any student outside these $k$ students cannot be classmates with these $k$ students regardless of how they enroll (having one course in common is enough to be classmates). Find the maximum number of $k$.</p><p><strong>Qwen2-Math-72B-Instruct Solution</strong></p><p>To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of students $ k $ such that each student has a unique combination of elective courses, any two students share at least one course, and no student outside these $ k $ students can be classmates with all of them. This means that the set of students chosen must cover all possible courses in such a way that any new student would have to share a course with at least one of the chosen students.</p><p>First, let&rsquo;s consider the total number of possible combinations of courses. Since there are 10 elective courses and each student can either take or not take each course, there are $ 2^{10} = 1024 $ possible combinations of courses. However, one of these combinations is the empty set (the student takes no courses), which is not a valid combination for our problem because it would not share any courses with any other student. Therefore, there are $ 1024 - 1 = 1023 $ non-empty combinations of courses.</p><p>We need to find the maximum number of students $ k $ such that any two students share at least one course, and no student outside these $ k $ students can be classmates with all of them. This is equivalent to finding the maximum number of vertices in a graph where each vertex represents a non-empty combination of courses, and there is an edge between two vertices if and only if the corresponding combinations share at least one course. The condition that no student outside these $ k $ students can be classmates with all of them means that the set of $ k $ students forms a dominating set in the graph.</p><p>The maximum size of such a set is the complement of the minimum size of an independent set in the graph. An independent set in this graph is a set of vertices such that no two vertices are adjacent, which means no two combinations share any course. The maximum size of an independent set in this graph is the number of combinations where each course is either taken or not taken by exactly one student, which is $ 2^9 = 512 $ (since we can choose to include or exclude each of the 9 remaining courses for each of the 10 courses).</p><p>Therefore, the minimum size of an independent set is 512, and the maximum size of a dominating set (which is the complement of the independent set) is $ 1023 - 512 + 1 = 511 $. However, we need to add 1 because the empty set is not included, so the correct calculation is $ 1023 - 511 = 512 $.</p><p>Thus, the maximum number of students $ k $ is $\boxed{512}$.</p></details><details><summary>Problem from USAMO 2010</summary><p><strong>Problem</strong></p><p>Let $ABC$ be a triangle with $\angle A = 90^{\circ}$.

For a right triangle, these distances are given by:</p><p>$$ ID = IE = r = \frac{a + b - \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{2} $$</p><p><strong>Step 5: Integer Lengths</strong> For $AB$, $AC$, $BI$, $ID$, $CI$, and $IE$ to all be integers, the following must hold:</p><ul><li>$a$ and $b$ are integers</li><li>$\frac{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{2}$ is an integer</li><li>$\frac{a + b - \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{2}$ is an integer</li></ul><p><strong>Step 6: Analysis</strong> For $\frac{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{2}$ to be an integer, $\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$ must be an even integer.
