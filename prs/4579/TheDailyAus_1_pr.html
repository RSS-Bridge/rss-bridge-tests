Around one in five workers are covered by an award.</p><p>Industry bodies, unions, the government and opposition all put forward their suggestions for the minimum wage review in the lead-up to today’s decision.</p><h2>Today&#039;s decision</h2><p>The Fair Work Commission chose to increase the minimum wage by 3.5%, slightly lower than last year’s<a href="https://thedailyaus.com.au/economics/fair-work-commission-minimum-wages"> increase of 3.75%.</a></p><p>This is in part because the rate of inflation (rising prices) is slowing. The latest quarterly inflation figures show prices rose 2.4% in the year to March 2025 (down from 3.6% in 2024).</p><p>The minimum wage increase will mostly impact workers covered by healthcare, hospitality, retail, and social services awards, who the FWC noted are “disproportionately female”.</p><p>Australia’s new minimum wage rates (from 1 July):</p><p>Hourly: $24.95</p><p>Weekly: $948.00</p><p>Annual: $49,296.00</p><p></p><h2>Economy</h2><p>The FWC noted high inflation over recent years directly hit workers’ wages. It said a 3.5% pay rise is “sustainable”.</p><p>It added “the uncertainty caused by changing U.S. trade policies” contributed to its decision.</p><p>The Trump administration has hit all of its trading partners with taxes on goods they exports to the U.S.</p><p>Australia is bracing for the impact of 50% tariffs on steel and aluminium exports, in addition to a 10% tariff on all other exports.</p><h2>Union response</h2><p>Australian Council of Trade Unions Secretary Sally McManus welcomed the FWC decision, after pushing for a <a href="https://www.actu.org.au/media-release/australian-unions-go-for-a-4-5-per-cent-wage-boost/">4.5% increase.</a></p><p>She said that the decision will mean minimum wages will outpace inflation, ensuring working people “are getting ahead”.</p><p>“It was time for low-wage workers, award workers, to start catching up for what was lost during the inflation spike,” McManus told reporters.</p><h2>Industry groups</h2><p>Key business group the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ACCI), described the FWC decision as “generous to employees”.</p><p>ACCI chief Andrew Mackellar said: “For many of the most vulnerable businesses, particularly small businesses in retail and hospitality, this increase will be very challenging to afford.“</p><p>The industry body said business profits are “contracting” and investment is “falling”.</p><h2>Political response</h2><p>Employment Minister Amanda Rishworth welcomed the FWC decision, noting the Government had pushed for a “real wage increase” — when wages increase by more than the rate of inflation. This decision is a real wage increase of 1.1%.</p><p>In a post on social media, Shadow Employment Minister Tim Wilson said the increase “is important to low paid workers,” while noting it’s “another expense employers... will have to deal with.”</p>

The ban applies to all products, whether they contain nicotine or not.</p><p>The sale of reusable vapes will continue.</p><h3>Comments</h3><p>The UK Government said the ban aims to tackle the health and environmental harms caused by “these nasty devices.”</p><p>Government Minister Mary Creagh said: “For too long, single-use vapes have blighted our streets as litter and hooked our children on nicotine. That ends today.”</p><p>The ban comes as the UK Parliament <a href="https://thedailyaus.com.au/latest/uk-introduces-tobacco-and-vaping-bill-to-ban-children-from-smoking">considers a bill </a>that would make it illegal to sell tobacco products, including cigarettes and vapes, to anyone born on or after 1 January 2009.</p>

Hamas has called for changes to the proposal, including assurances that the ceasefire would hold after the 60 days.</p><p>Witkoff said Hamas’ <a href="https://x.com/SE_MiddleEast/status/1928892532483670264">response</a> was “totally unacceptable and only takes us backwards.” He urged Hamas to accept the deal so the parties can begin “substantive negotiations in good-faith to try to reach a permanent ceasefire.”</p><p>In a joint statement, Qatar and Egypt, who have been hosting ceasefire talks, repeated Witkoff’s request to begin a 60-day ceasefire as a starting point “for a permanent ceasefire agreement in the Gaza Strip.”</p><h3>Aid attacks</h3><p>While ceasefire negotiations remain ongoing, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) reported on Sunday that at least 21 people were shot dead at an aid centre in southern Gaza.</p><p>The ICRC said it was “the highest number of weapon-wounded in a single incident” since it established its field hospital in southern Gaza.</p><p>The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) denied shooting at civilians and called these reports “false”.</p><h3>GHF centre</h3><p>The aid centre where the incident occurred is being operated by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a non-government organisation with U.S. and Israeli support.</p><p>The GHF currently operates out of four distribution hubs, each capable of feeding 300,000 people.</p><p>The World Health Organisation has previously said the entire 2.1 million population of Gaza faces prolonged food shortages following a months-long Israeli blockade.</p><h3>Response</h3><p>In response to reports, the GHF said: “There was no gunfire in the [distribution] centre and also not in the surrounding area... All aid was distributed today without incident. We have heard that these fake reports have been actively fomented by Hamas. They are untrue and fabricated.”</p><p>In a post to X, UN Relief Works Agency chief Philippe Lazzarini criticised GHF.
He claimed it was a “humiliating system [that’s] forced thousands of hungry and desperate people to walk for tens of miles to an area that’s all but pulverised due to heavy bombardment by the Israeli Army.”</p>

It’s applied to foreign-made goods brought into another country, and paid by the importer.</p><p>For example: Country A and Country B make the same product. Country A wants its citizens to buy its own version of the product, not Country B’s, so it applies a tariff.</p><p>Importers in Country A now pay the tax when they bring in B’s product, and pass on the cost to consumers, making this version of the product more expensive to buy.</p><h3>Steel and aluminium</h3><p>On 10 February, Trump announced he would impose a 25% tariff on aluminium and steel, repeating a move from his first presidency.</p><p>Steel is used in many heavy industries, such as car manufacturing and construction. Aluminium is also used in car manufacturing, and in household items including pots, pans, and foil.</p><p>In 2024, the U.S. imported around $US270 million of Australian aluminium, and about $US400 million of Australian steel.</p><h3>Update</h3><p>On Saturday, Trump posted on his social media platform Truth Social that he will double the steel and aluminium tariffs.</p><p>It followed a speech he gave at a steel plant in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania, where he said tariffs will “ensure that all steelworkers will keep their jobs and all facilities in the United States will remain open and thriving.”</p><p>Government data shows steel prices have risen by around 16% since January, when Trump took office.</p><p>The new tariffs will come into effect on 4 June.</p><h3>Australia</h3><p>Trade Minister Don Farrell told Australian media on Saturday that the tariffs were “unjustifiable and not the act of a friend.”</p><p>“[Tariffs] are an act of economic self harm that will only hurt consumers and businesses who rely on free and fair trade.”</p><p>Former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull successfully negotiated to avoid Trump’s previous planned tariffs in 2018.</p><h3>Opposition</h3><p>Shadow Trade Minister Kevin Hogan said the Government “needs to double its efforts to protect our steel industry and local jobs for our steel workers.”</p><p>The Coalition said it is “imperative” for Albanese to meet with Trump during the G7 summit this month in Canada “to develop a personal rapport” and “protect Australian industries.”</p>

Police have still not found her.</p><p>This week, a court handed down life sentences for the trio, finding the child was likely kidnapped and trafficked.</p><h3>Sentence</h3><p>The ruling followed an eight-week trial, during which <a href="https://www.canva.com/link?target=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.npa.gov.za%2Fmedia%2Fnpa-welcomes-conviction-and-sentencing-groundbreaking-case-trafficking-persons-and-kidnapping&amp;design=DAGo5BTg6R8&amp;accessRole=owner&amp;linkSource=comment">state prosecutors</a> argued the trio had devised “an elaborate plan to sell Joshlin” to a local traditional healer for around 20,000 rand ($AU1,740).</p><p>Prosecutors believe the child was trafficked for “<a href="https://thedailyaus.com.au/podcast/slavery-in-2023-how-it-impacts-you">slavery</a> or practices similar to slavery.”</p><p>One witness testified that Smith had said Joshlin was sold to a traditional healer who wanted the child for her “eyes and skin”.</p><p>The court “drew no distinction” in terms of criminal responsibility between the three accused, handing them all identical life sentences for trafficking, and an extra 10 years each for kidnapping.</p><p>In handing down his judgment, Presiding Judge Nathan Erasmus said the trio had shown “no indication of remorse” throughout the criminal proceedings.</p><p>“There is nothing that I can find that is redeeming and deserving of a lesser sentence than the harshest I can impose,” he said.</p><p>The court also ordered that all three offenders be added to the national child protection register.</p><h3>Comments</h3><p>The case’s early stages garnered national attention and brought hundreds of people together in a search for Joshlin.</p><p>The Government called the court’s ruling this week “a bittersweet moment.”</p><p>Cabinet Minister Khumbudzo Ntshavheni said the Government remains “steadfast in [its] commitment to uncovering the truth and ensuring that law enforcement continues to pursue every possible lead to find Joshlin.”</p><p>The Federal Police Commissioner similarly welcomed the courts’ judgment, saying it “must serve as a deterrent” for violence against women and children in the country.</p><p>Commissioner Fannie Masemola said a second phase of the search for Joshlin has begun.</p><p>“We are hoping we will find the child, wherever she is, she must still be found,” Masemola said.</p>

That’s because of indexation, the annual increase that adjusts your debt in line with today’s rising prices.</p><p>Legislation to implement the debt reduction has not yet been introduced to Parliament, and probably won’t be for at least another six weeks.</p><p>Here’s how and when it’ll happen.</p><h3>Indexation</h3><p>Indexation is the annual process where the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) adjusts outstanding student loans to reflect changes in the value of money over time.</p><p>Historically, it’s been tied to inflation. Following reforms last year, however, indexation is now capped at whichever is lower between the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Wage Price Index (WPI).</p><p>This year, <a href="https://www.education.gov.au/higher-education-loan-program/resources/2025-indexed-rates">indexation will be 3.2%</a>, based on the CPI, and applied on 1 June.</p><h3>Reduction</h3><p>The election promise will only come into effect once legislation has passed both houses of Parliament, which returns for a new working year on 22 July.</p><p>The reduction will be applied automatically by the ATO.</p><p>It will apply to the amount of your loan before indexation.</p><p>The indexation applied this weekend will then be recalculated based on the new, reduced loan amount.</p>

In <a href="https://thedailyaus.com.au/world/elon-musk-us-govt-contract-expires-next-month">April</a>, he claimed reports he was leaving DOGE were “fake news.”</p><p>Musk said he “thank[s] President [Donald Trump] for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending.”</p><p>DOGE will continue to operate despite Musk’s departure.</p><h3>DOGE</h3><p>DOGE was announced by U.S. President Donald Trump shortly after his election. The department is designed to “slash excess regulations... and restructure Federal Agencies”.</p><p>Until now, it has been led by Musk.</p><p>As of its latest update, DOGE claims it has saved the government $US175 billion ($AU270 billion).</p><p>These savings have come from cutting funding for federal departments, including the U.S. Agency for International Development. Approximately 15 of its 10,000 employees will keep their jobs.</p><p>In January, Musk claimed DOGE had also “saved taxpayers over $1 billion in crazy [diversity, equity and inclusion] contracts.”</p><h3>Trump and Musk</h3><p>While Musk has played a prominent role in the current Trump administration, in an interview with CBS on Wednesday, he said he was “disappointed” with Trump’s ‘One Big Beautiful Bill Act’.</p><p>The Act aims to extend tax cuts and increase the total amount of debt the government can have. “I think a bill can be big or it can be beautiful… but I don&#039;t know if it can be both,” Musk said.</p><p>He said the “massive spending” in the bill “undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing.”</p><h3>Future</h3><p>Despite Musk’s departure, <a href="https://doge.gov/savings">DOGE</a> is intended to operate until 4 July 2026.</p><p>On Thursday Musk said: “The DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government.”</p><p>The White House has not announced who will succeed Musk.</p>

The trial, which started on 11 March, will now begin again.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Maradona died of heart failure in November 2020 at the age of 60, following surgery for a blood clot on his brain.</p><p>His seven-person medical team is on trial for homicide by negligence. If found guilty, they could be imprisoned for up to 25 years. They have rejected the charges, claiming the former football star refused treatment.</p><h3>What happened</h3><p>Judge Julieta Makintach stepped down from the case on Tuesday after a prosecutor revealed in court that she had participated in a documentary about the trial.</p><p>Makintach said she had “no choice” but to step down after facing heavy criticism.</p><p>On Thursday, the court declared a mistrial. Judge Maximiliano Savarino said: “Judge Makintach did not act impartially. Her conduct caused harm to both the plaintiffs and the defence.”</p><h3>Maradona’s career</h3><p>Maradona is a national hero in Argentina for his rare talents as a footballer. As a player, he made his debut for the national team at the age of 16 and scored 259 goals in 491 matches across international and domestic football.</p><p>He is most revered for leading Argentina to victory at the 1986 <a href="https://thedailyaus.com.au/sport/staying-up-for-the-world-cup-final-tonight-heres-what-you-need-to-know">World Cup</a>. This tournament was also where he scored the ‘<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB-q_v_gGvY">Hand of God</a>’ goal — a controversial goal in the quarter-final against England, where he jumped for a header and punched the ball towards goal.</p><p>He later said about the goal: &quot;A little with the head of Maradona and a little with the hand of God&quot;</p><p>He also played football for Italian club Napoli and Spanish club Barcelona.</p><h3>What’s next</h3><p>It’s unclear when the trial will re-commence. The bench for the new trial will be selected by lottery from a pool of judges.

It’s a ‘semaglutide’ and belongs to a family of drugs called GLP-1s.</p><p>Dr Michael Bonning from the Australian Medical Association said GLP-1s “slow gastric emptying, so you feel fuller, faster... You ended up with people losing significant amounts of weight.“</p><p>He told TDA that side effect means “these drugs have become increasingly popular for an indication that they weren&#039;t originally put on the market for.”</p><h3>Poll</h3><p>TDA’s new podcast series ‘Investigating Ozempic’ explores the increased demand for GLP-1s and their broader impacts.</p><p>Around 25,000 followers answered a TDA poll earlier this year.</p><p>We asked respondents if they had used Ozempic (or a similar drug) before. More than one in ten said yes. Of those who hadn’t, nearly half said they want to/have previously wanted to try GLP-1s.</p><p>However, the popularity of drugs like Ozempic isn’t without controversy. Experts, patients, and advocates paint a complex picture.</p><h3>Juniper</h3><p>TDA took a closer look at major Australian telehealth provider Juniper during our investigation. Former patients have accused the platform of careless prescribing practices and potentially harmful marketing tactics.</p><p>Juniper strongly denies any allegations of wrongdoing, and some claims may not relate to its current processes.</p><p>While it’s not the only virtual health provider that prescribes weight loss medications in Australia, a clear pattern emerged amongst the large volume of audience feedback we received, which put Juniper in a category of its own.</p><p>Sarah said she became “fixated” on how much weight she was losing after being prescribed weight loss medication through Juniper when she was 24.</p><p>“I was weighing myself two or three times a day. It really turned into more of an eating disorder,” Sarah told TDA.</p><p>When she wanted to cancel her subscription, Sarah said Juniper’s follow-up marketing – including regular texts and emails with limited-time offers and discount codes – made it hard to walk away.</p><p>“ They’re really, really playing to your weaknesses. I still get targeted with [Juniper] ads… It’s all very on the nose for me,” Sarah said.</p><h3>Facebook ad</h3><p>Some health experts have criticised Juniper’s marketing strategy, including ads suggesting patients can “save money” on food by using weight loss medication.</p><p>For example, a Facebook ad showing what looks like a real conversation between two users. One says that since starting medical weight loss, they are “spending sooo much less on food”.</p><p>In reply, another commenter says: “My takeaway bill monthly was more than Juniper… I’m saving money”.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2wrdndo8/production/98b014624c12e47fffaf510503b22224748bdb76-353x496.png" /></p><p>Source: Meta Ad Library</p><p>Juniper defended the ad to TDA, which it said “depicts an exchange which was inspired by real conversations between members of the Juniper online community.”</p><p>The platform describes saving money on food as a “genuine benefit experienced by Juniper’s patients,” and a “legitimate angle to canvas in Juniper’s messaging.”</p><p>Melissa Wilton from the Butterfly Foundation told TDA it’s “exploitative” to suggest that people could “save more money through accessing weight loss medications instead of accessing food... considering our current cost of living crisis.”</p><h3>Personalised graph</h3><p>Juniper’s comments did not clarify whether its marketing strategy is in alignment with the latest harm-minimisation advice from eating disorder experts.</p><p>TDA also asked Juniper about its online screening survey, which shows users a personalised graph projecting how much weight they could lose, if they sign up to Juniper’s program — regardless of their BMI (the metric the platform and other providers use to determine patient eligibility).</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2wrdndo8/production/17d4b19ae50c1b176fb21a7b2cb8585e2f87db1e-401x353.png" /></p><p>The next step in the prescribing process is to book a phone consult with a Juniper practitioner. Users are required to pay a refundable deposit to proceed to this stage.</p><p>Juniper says “TGA regulations mandate a minimum BMI and a health-related weight condition” in order to prescribe someone weight loss medications.</p><p>However, after completing the questionnaire, some users receive daily follow-up emails, texts and promotional offers — even if they are ineligible for treatment.</p><p>TDA asked Juniper why it markets to patients who are ineligible for treatment.</p><p>It said: “We accept TDA’s concerns in relation to this specific graph and are in the process of amending it so that it does not display an initial weight which falls within a healthy BMI range.”</p><h3>Response</h3><p><a href="https://butterfly.org.au">Butterfly Foundation</a> spokesperson Melissa Wilton warns these promotions “can be highly triggering” for people with/at risk of developing an eating disorder.</p><p>“Some of these companies are skirting the law and need to be made accountable,” she told TDA. Similar concerns were noted by food and nutrition scientist Dr Emma Beckett.</p><p>The national eating disorder charity “strongly recommends” anyone considering these medications speak (in person) to a healthcare professional “who understands eating disorders and is able to provide tailored advice”.</p><p>Butterfly Foundation: 1800 33 4673</p>

Liquified natural gas (LNG), cooled natural gas in liquid form, is exported elsewhere, including Japan.</p><p>The North West Shelf has become Australia’s largest oil and gas project, led by Woodside — a company valued at $47 billion.</p><p>Six years ago, Woodside applied for an extension of gas drilling and production from 2030 to 2070.</p><p>Extensions require state and federal environmental approvals.</p><p>The state government handed down its approval in December, specifying there would need to be regular air quality monitoring and consultation with Traditional Owners.</p><h2>Decision</h2><p>Yesterday, the federal government greenlit extending the project to 2070.</p><p>Newly-appointed Environment Minister Murray Watt said there are <a href="https://minister.dcceew.gov.au/watt/media-releases/statement-north-west-shelf-gas-processing-project">“strict conditions”</a> attached to the extension. Woodside needs to respond within 10 days.</p><p>In a statement, he said the “impact of air emissions on the Murujuga rock art,” a cluster of engravings in the Burrup Peninsula, was part of his decision.</p><p>“I have ensured that adequate protection for the rock art is central,” Watt said.</p><p>Murujuga is in the same area as the North West Shelf and is home to some of the oldest rock art on Earth, dating back 50,000 years.</p><p>In a separate announcement this week, the United Nations body tasked with listing World Heritage sites released a draft decision on the feasibility of adding the Murujuga Cultural Landscape to its list.</p><p>The committee said Australia needs to “prevent any further industrial development” in the area to achieve heritage listing.</p><h2>Reaction</h2><p>The Government’s conditional extension of the North West Shelf project has drawn criticism from environmental groups, while the company at the centre welcomed the decision.</p><p>Woodside Executive <a href="https://www.woodside.com/docs/default-source/asx-announcements/2025/037-woodside-welcomes-proposed-nws-extension-approval.pdf?sfvrsn=4c735c7d_3">Vice President Liz Westcott</a> said the extension approval supports “thousands of direct and indirect jobs”.</p><p>Shadow Environment Minister Angie Bell told the ABC the Coalition supported the government’s move, saying project approvals need to “balance between the environmental sustainability and the economy and jobs.”</p><p>The Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) said the Woodside extension would set off a “climate bomb”.</p><p>It would become the largest fossil fuel project in the Southern Hemisphere, according to the ACF, and rank within the top 10 most polluting global projects.</p><p>Greens leader Larissa Waters called the decision “an epic climate fail”.</p><p>She criticised the government for pushing out the decision until after the federal election on 3 May.</p><p>“Locking in fossil fuels out to 2070 is not what their voters expected.”</p><p>The ACF’s First Nations lead Josie Alec told reporters on Thursday: “The Australian Government’s laws are not strong enough... for the environment.”</p><p>“There’s always hope, we have to believe that someone, somewhere is going to stop the idiocy of [destroying] country.“</p><p>Alec indicated there could be a legal challenge to the proposed extension.</p>

The average age of his victims was 11.</p><p>A group of victims have called for institutional change in France in response.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Le Scouarnec worked as an abdominal surgeon across dozens of <a href="https://thedailyaus.com.au/podcast/the-largest-child-abuse-trial-in-french-history">French</a> hospitals.</p><p>After retiring in 2017, he was charged with raping two of his nieces, as well as a six-year-old girl and another young patient.</p><p>Evidence seized from his home in western France included child-sized sex dolls, hundreds of thousands of child abuse images, and 25 years’ worth of Le Scouarnec’s personal diaries. Across thousands of diary entries, Le Scouarnec appeared to describe assaulting several young patients.</p><p>The retired doctor denied the charges and said the diaries were “fantasies,” rather than accounts of real events.</p><p>He was found guilty of abusing all four children and sentenced to 15 years imprisonment in 2020, while police continued working to identify the victims named in his diaries.</p><p>He was eventually charged with over 100 counts of rape and 150 sexual assault offences.</p><p>The charges found the surgeon assaulted or raped 299 patients between 1989 and 2014. Of the victims, 256 were under 15, including a one-year-old baby. The oldest victim was aged 70 at the time of the incident.</p><h3>Trial</h3><p>Le Scouarnec’s trial began in Brittany at the end of February.</p><p>Le Scouarnec initially denied several charges, but admitted to the inappropriate touching of some patients.</p><p>In March, however, he admitted to sexually assaulting all of the 299 victims.</p><p>In a court statement last week Le Scouarnec said: “I can no longer look at myself the same way because I am a paedophile and a child rapist.”</p><h3>Verdict</h3><p>On Wednesday, Le Scouarnec was sentenced to 20 years in prison, the maximum sentence available. He must serve at least two-thirds of the sentence before being eligible for release.</p><p>Le Scouarnec will serve the new sentence at the same time as the existing 15-year prison sentence handed down in 2020, with any added time in prison served after the original sentence. Due to being imprisoned during his first trial, he has now served seven years in prison, meaning his new sentence will be two-thirds completed by 2030.</p><h3>Response</h3><p>The prosecution, advocates, and victims have expressed disapproval of the verdict, comparing it to countries where sentences can be stacked and served consecutively, not concurrently.</p><p>According to CNN, a group of victims have called for structural change, saying the trial “seems to leave no mark on the government, the medical community, or society at large”.</p><p>French Health Minister <a href="https://x.com/yannickneuder?lang=en">Yannick Neuder</a> told local media: “We must act… so that this situation doesn’t happen again.”</p><p>1800 RESPECT</p><p>Call: 1800 737 732</p><p>Text: 0458 737 732</p>

It’s applied to foreign-made goods brought into another country and paid by the importer.</p><p>Since coming to power in January, Trump has imposed a range of tariffs on imports to the U.S, including a 25% tariff on Australian steel and aluminium.</p><p>The goal of tariffs is to encourage a country’s companies and citizens to buy locally-produced goods, boosting industrial activity. Trump has also claimed trading partners have “ripped off” America.</p><h3>&#039;Liberation Day&#039;</h3><p>In an address at the White House on 2 April, Trump announced a minimum 10% tariff on all countries’ exports. He called the announcement “Liberation Day”.</p><p>Displaying a chart of tariffs imposed against the U.S. by other countries, Trump claimed he was charging “approximately half” of that amount in return. For example, the U.S. planned to impose a 34% tariff on China, who Trump claimed charged a 67% tariff on American products.</p><p>Since then, the U.S. and China have agreed to temporarily <a href="https://thedailyaus.com.au/world/the-us-and-china-have-agreed-to-reduce-tariffs-for-90-days">pause</a> their tariffs.</p><h3>Ruling</h3><p>On Wednesday, the <a href="https://www.cit.uscourts.gov/about-court">Court of International Trade</a> in New York City blocked Trump’s ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs.</p><p>Trump has been using emergency powers to impose tariffs on global imports. These powers allow the President to declare a national emergency and pass certain legislation.</p><p>The court ruled that the U.S. Constitution only gives Congress the ability to impose tariffs and manage the international economy. The judges said Trump’s tariffs “exceed any authority granted to the President”.</p><h3>Response</h3><p>The judges have given the White House 10 days to suspend the tariffs.</p><p>The Trump administration has filed an appeal to overturn the decision.</p><p>White House spokesperson Kush Desai told U.S. media: “It is not for unelected judges to decide how to properly address a national emergency.”</p>

They made fewer errors, conceded fewer penalties, completed more sets, and (crucially) scored more points. The final score was 18-6, with NSW scoring four tries to Queensland’s one.</p><p>In what looked to be a shift of momentum for the Maroons near the end of the first half, Brian To’o was sent to the sin bin for making contact with Xavier Coates in the air. However, the Maroons failed to take full advantage of the Blues missing a player for ten minutes.</p><p>Blues prop Payne Haas was named man of the match for a typically solid performance from the barnstorming Broncos star.</p><p>For the Blues, it’s the first time they have won three straight matches since 2006. It’s also the first time that they have won back-to-back matches at Lang Park in Brisbane.</p><p>The next two matches of the series will be played in Perth on 18 June and Sydney on 9 July.</p><h3>Women’s State of Origin</h3><p>The State of Origin action continues tonight with the third and final match of the women’s series being played in Newcastle.</p><p>The Blues have already wrapped up the series after winning the first two matches in dominant fashion (32-12 and 26-6). However, there is plenty of pride on the line as the Maroons seek to avoid a historic whitewash.</p><p>NSW coach John Strange has named an unchanged side from the one fielded in the opening two matches. Meanwhile, Queensland coach Tahnee Norris has called upon two players to make their Origin debut, fullback Hayley Maddick and substitute half Georgia Hannaway. Maddick will start in place of star player Tamika Upton, who injured her hip in Game Two.</p><p>The Maroons will take confidence in the fact that they won last year’s match in Newcastle, with Lauren Brown slotting a field goal to help her side claim an 11-10 victory.</p><h3>How to watch</h3><p>You can watch Game Three of Women’s State of Origin on <a href="State of Origin: Blues outclass Maroons to take series lead">Channel 9</a>. Kick-off is at 7:45pm.

It’s a ‘semaglutide’ and belongs to a family of drugs called GLP-1s.</p><p>Dr Michael Bonning from the Australian Medical Association said GLP-1s “slow gastric emptying, so you feel fuller, faster... You ended up with people losing significant amounts of weight.“</p><p>He told TDA that side effect means “these drugs have become increasingly popular for an indication that they weren&#039;t originally put on the market for.”</p><h3>Side effects</h3><p>Common side effects associated with popular GLP-1s like Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro include nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea — but many users reported more serious side effects in a callout to TDA’s Instagram.</p><p>Examples include gastrointestinal issues and multiple reports of emergency gallbladder removal surgeries.</p><p>Several GLP-1 users also reported severe mental health side effects, including Mackenzie, who told TDA she was hospitalised weeks after starting Ozempic.</p><p>“For no reason whatsoever... I became suicidal, unable to work… It was really quite unexplained and I was really, really concerned,” Mackenzie said.</p><p>The 26-year-old’s GP told her he’d seen an uptick in patients reporting the same side effect. He concluded that the Ozempic may have interfered with Mackenzie’s long-term antidepressant medication.</p><p>“[Ozempic] slows the digestive system, which then can have negative effects on absorption,” her doctor told her.</p><p>“I was in such a bad place he suggested I go to hospital [and] stop taking Ozempic immediately,” Mackenzie said.</p><h3>Tracker</h3><p>When patients have a negative reaction to a medication, their GP or healthcare provider can report it to the TGA’s <a href="https://www.tga.gov.au/safety/database-adverse-event-notifications-daen">Database of Adverse Event Notifications </a>(DAEN).</p><p>TDA analysed reports related to the use of GLP-1s (including Ozempic) between January 2023 and January 2025.</p><p>Pancreatitis made up around one in four adverse side effects reported to the DAEN in that time. Treatment of acute pancreatitis typically requires hospital care.</p><p>One in five reports to the DAEN related to accidental overdose or the inappropriate use of GLP-1s, including drugs not yet approved by the TGA.</p><p>TDA’s analysis also found that suicidal ideation made up one in every 20 adverse GLP-1 reactions reported to the database.</p><p>The TGA says it uses adverse event reports “to identify when a safety issue may be present,” but that assessing the safety of a medicine “cannot be made” using its tracker alone.</p><h3>Deaths</h3><p>There were three reports of attempted suicide, and separately, two deaths by suicide associated with the use of GLP-1s in the two years to January 2025.</p><p>Ozempic was the only product “suspected to be related” to both deaths.</p><p>There were also four Ozempic-related poisoning deaths due to misuse, overdose or accident during this period.</p><p>However, this does not mean the TGA has determined these deaths are related to GLP-1s.</p><h3>Studies</h3><p>Mackenzie (who became suicidal after starting Ozempic) went through telehealth platform Juniper. The provider maintains there’s no major known risk of suicidal ideation as a side effect of GLP-1s.</p><p>Juniper cited 2024 guidance from the UK health regulator to TDA, which said: “The available data does not support a causal association between [GLP-1s] and suicide, suicidal ideation... and depression”.</p><p>However, recent analysis of adverse reactions within the World Health Organization’s global database identified a “disproportionate link” between suicidal ideation and semaglutides.</p><p>Lifeline: <a href="tel:131114">13 11 14</a></p>

Here’s what happened at <a href="https://www.rolandgarros.com/en-us/">Roland Garros</a> to kick off the 2025 edition of the tournament.</p><h3>Aussies</h3><p>The tournament began with 16 Aussie men and women in the singles draws. Only five have advanced to the second round.</p><p>In the men’s draw, Adam Walton, Alexei Popyrin (25), and Alex de Minaur (9) are all still in contention. Overnight, Walton beat German qualifier Maximilian Marterer in five sets (7-6, 4-6, 6-3, 2-6, 6-2) to claim his first-ever victory at the French Open. Alex de Minaur won his first-round match in straight sets, defeating Serbia’s Laslo Djere.</p><p>In the second round, Walton faces 17th seed Andrey Rublev, and de Minaur takes on Alexander Bublik. Meanwhile, Popyrin will play his second-round match tonight against Chile’s Alejandro Tabilo.</p><p>In the women’s draw, 17th seed Daria Kasatkina and Ajla Tomljanović are both through one round. Kasatkina started her first grand slam campaign under the Australian flag with a win, beating Kateřina Siniaková in three sets. She is set to play France’s Leolia Jeanjean next.</p><p>Tomljanović beat fellow Aussie Maya Joint in straight sets and has been handed a tough assignment in Italian fourth seed Jasmine Paolini in the second round.</p><h3>The upsets</h3><p>The opening round has seen several seeded players exit the tournament much earlier than expected. In the men’s draw, the biggest upset so far saw fourth seed American Taylor Fritz lose to German qualifier Daniel Altmaier. 11th seed Daniil Medvedev and 18th seed Francisco Cerundolo also made early exits.</p><p>In the women’s draw, American ninth seed Emma Navarro was the first to make a shock exit after losing to Spain’s Jessica Bouzas Maneiro. Navarro won just one game in the straight-set loss. Czech 14th seed Karolína Muchová’s 2025 French Open campaign also ended in the opening round.</p><h3>The favourites</h3><p>Men’s defending champ Carlos Alcaraz and world number one <a href="https://thedailyaus.com.au/sport/sinner-returns-to-tennis-following-three-month-ban">Jannik Sinner</a> both cruised through their opening round matches with straight-set victories. The women’s defending champion, Iga Świątek, and world number one Aryna Sabalenka made similarly strong starts.</p><p>The most impressive opening round performance belongs to 35-year-old Victoria Azarenka, who became the oldest player to win a grand slam match without conceding a single game (6-0, 6-0). Azarenka beat Belgium&#039;s Yanina Wickmayer.

The Coalition has now agreed to reunify as the official opposition bloc to the re-elected Labor Government, and has announced its Shadow Cabinet.</p><p>Here’s what you need to know.</p><h2>The demands</h2><p>Initially, the Coalition split over disagreements between the Liberal and National parties on four policy positions. They were...</p><p>Nuclear energy
The Nationals believe Australia needs to introduce nuclear energy to Australia through overturning a national ban. The Coalition promised to do this if it was elected earlier this month. The Nationals do not believe that the Coalition’s loss was because of its nuclear policy. Littleproud said the Australian economy cannot run efficiently on renewables.</p><p>Regional Australia Future Fund
In the run up to the last election, ex-Liberal leader Peter Dutton promised to set up a $20 billion fund to provide better infrastructure for regional and remote Australia.</p><p>Divestiture powers
This was a Coalition policy that could force large companies to sell parts of their business if they demonstrated anti-competitive behaviour. It was specifically aimed at breaking up the powers of supermarkets.</p><p>Universal Service Obligation
Guaranteed mobile and internet access in remote and regional Australia.</p><h2>Solidarity</h2><p>The other disagreement that led to the Coalition split was whether the Nationals wanted to waive obligations of cabinet solidarity.</p><p>This is where senior ministers are gagged from publicly criticising cabinet decisions in both government and opposition.</p><p>Liberal leader Sussan Ley said the Nationals pushed to scrap solidarity in order to speak freely, while the Nationals rejected her claims.</p><p>Both parties have since agreed to be bound by cabinet solidarity.</p><h2>Resolution</h2><p>On Friday, the Liberal Party held a meeting where MPs and Senators agreed “in principle” to all four policies put forward by the Nationals.</p><p>An “in principle” agreement is not binding, but is generally perceived as an expression of support.</p><p>The Nationals reconvened, where they determined that they would sign a Coalition agreement, which was struck this morning.</p><h2>Shadow Cabinet</h2><p>Earlier today, Liberal leader Sussan Ley and Nationals leader David Littleproud unveiled the <a href="https://www.liberal.org.au/our-team/shadow-ministry">shadow cabinet.</a></p><p>The reshuffle has seen some senior Liberals’ roles change, including Angus Taylor, who has been moved from Shadow Treasurer to Shadow Defence Minister.</p><p>Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, who moved from the Nationals to the Liberal party room earlier this month, has been replaced as Shadow Minister for Indigenous Affairs by SA Senator Kerrynne Liddle.</p><h2>What now?</h2><p>The Coalition parties will now form the official Opposition to the Labor Government.</p><p>Coalition agreements are traditionally not revealed in public, so it’s not clear whether policy commitments formed the basis of the new deal.</p><p>“I know that we will be a great partnership going forward,” Ley told reporters this afternoon.</p><p>Littleproud added: “The focus now is on Anthony Albanese and the Labor Government and holding them to
account.”</p><p></p>

Once humans are exposed, PFAS can remain in the body indefinitely.</p><p>The long-term health effects of PFAS exposure are still not fully understood, prompting countries like Australia to reduce their use across a range of industries.</p><h3>Detection</h3><p>The newly released data marks the first time Australia’s exposure to forever chemicals has been measured on a large scale.</p><p>Voluntary blood and urine samples from around 7,500 eligible Australians across the country were collected between January 2022 and April 2024.</p><p>PFOS and PFOA were the two most commonly detected substances, showing up in over 95% of participants.</p><p>Men and people aged over 75 were most likely to have detectable levels of PFAS in their blood.</p><p>The ABS said that even though some test results did not show a detection of PFAS in the blood, “everyone has had some level of exposure to PFAS.”</p><p>Instead, the levels were too low to be “accurately measured.”</p><p>ABS head of health statistics James Eynstone-Hinkins said the data will help “create a national baseline” for PFAS levels in the general population.</p><p>“The dataset will enable future monitoring and support further research into PFAS and the potential impacts of these chemicals on human health,” Eynstone-Hinkins said.</p><h3>Senate Inquiry</h3><p>A <a href="https://thedailyaus.com.au/health/a-national-inquiry-will-examine-the-impacts-of-forever-chemicals">Senate Inquiry </a>is currently investigating the “extent, regulation and management of PFAS” in Australia.</p><p>Independent Senator Lidia Thorpe, who leads the inquiry, has described PFAS as “the asbestos of the 21st century”.</p><p>Scientists have linked PFAS exposure to liver damage, kidney disease, type II diabetes, and some cancers.</p><p>The inquiry is expected to hand down its final report in August.</p>

The hospital faced an audit this year following the 2024 death of a two-year-old.</p><p>The NSW Auditor-General’s report urged Healthscope to review safety concerns.</p><h3>Receivership</h3><p>Earlier this month, Healthscope was revealed to have stopped paying rents and interest payments on its debts.</p><p>Now, Healthscope’s parent entities have announced they are entering receivership. This does not include the management side of the business, which runs the hospitals.</p><p>Independent company restructuring firm McGrathNicol will take over to coordinate its sale.</p><h3>What that means</h3><p>Healthscope will now go through a sale process for the overall business.</p><p>It has insisted the operation of the 38 private hospitals around Australia won’t be affected, including pre-booked surgeries and appointments.</p><p>CEO Tino La Spina said: “There’ll be no hospital closures, there’ll be no redundancies.”</p><p>Commonwealth Bank, one of the Healthscope’s lenders, has provided $100 million to keep the hospitals running.</p><h3>Reactions</h3><p>Health Minister Mark Butler said the news would be “highly distressing to the patients, staff, and local communities that depend on Healthscope’s services.”</p><p>Butler said he was reassured by Healthscope’s confirmation that staffing and patient care won’t be impacted.</p><p>He ruled out the government bailing out the company.</p><p>Liberal Senator Anne Ruston, who was the Coalition’s health spokesperson in the last parliamentary term, urged Butler to “ensure the viability of Australia’s private hospitals”.</p><p>The Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation Federal Secretary Annie Butler said despite Healthscope’s reassurances, it has presented a “very difficult and worrying” situation.</p><p>Butler added that all private health providers should be reviewed in future, adding “we can’t allow profits to be put before patient care”.</p><p>Head of the Australian Medical Association Dr Danielle McMullen said the group was “ready to work with the receivers as part of ensuring the uninterrupted operation of Healthscope hospitals.”</p>

In the opening match last year, the Maroons dominated the Blues 38-10 in Sydney. They then lost in the series decider in Brisbane.</p><p>This is the third year with former Qld and Storm fullback Billy Slater coaching the side.</p><p>On paper, the Maroons are lacking their usual star power, missing Ben Hunt, Reece Walsh, and Selwyn Cobbo due to injury.</p><p>As a result, Robert Toia, Beau Fermor, and Trent Loiero are set to make their debuts on the notoriously physical State of Origin stage.</p><p>With just 10 NRL matches to his name, Toia will become the least experienced starting player in Origin history.</p><p>The Maroons&#039; greatest asset may be Daly Cherry-Evans and Cameron Munster. Cherry-Evans and Munster are the second most experienced Origin halves pairing of all time, after Queensland legends Darren Lockyer and Johnathon Thurston.</p><h3>Blues</h3><p>The Blues are looking to go back-to-back for the first time since 2019. </p><p>The biggest change for the side compared with last year has been in coaching personnel, with Laurie Daley returning to the role in place of Michael Maguire, who left the job for a full-time role at the Brisbane Broncos.</p><p>Daley’s previous tenure was for five series between 2013 and 2017. During that time, the Blues only won one series (in 2014), but it was significant as it ended an eight-year period of Queensland dominance.</p><p>The biggest challenge for NSW this year is juggling the dual star power of halves Nathan Cleary and Mitch Moses. Both players have played instrumental roles in leading NSW to victory in previous years, but they have never taken to the field together.</p><p>The Blues may also be hampered by injury tomorrow night, with centre Stephen Crichton having to pass a fitness test on Wednesday morning to play.</p><h3>The series</h3><p>The game is set to kick off at 8:05pm tomorrow night (AEST). It will be broadcast on Channel 9.</p><p>Game two is set to be played on neutral ground in Perth, and game three (which could be a series decider) is in Sydney.</p><p>
