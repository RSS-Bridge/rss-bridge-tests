Generally only used when you wanted to destroy a world rather than conquer it, there were few threats to Mankind’s galactic ambition that truly warranted Titans until the Horus Heresy. Suddenly, god-engine fought god-engine in apocalyptic duels that dwarfed the battles beneath them, unleashing weapons of city-shattering proportions to desperately overwhelm their equally deadly foe – regardless of the collateral damage.</p><p>Accordingly, Titans can be a terrifying prospect in games of Warhammer: The Horus Heresy, especially if a player hadn’t expected to face one or prepared their army appropriately, but fear not noble Princeps – their rules in the <em>Liber Questoris</em> book come with a whole new mission type designed especially for them: <strong>Engine Kill Missions</strong>.</p></div></div><div id=""><div class="article-fullWidthImage"><div class="xl:flex flex-col items-end xl-max:out-container xl:w-full mx-auto                 xl:column"><div class="w-full"><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1075" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="w-full" style="color:transparent;object-position:50% 50%" src="https://assets.warhammer-community.com/thh_titanrules-jul10-picwide1-chf7vn6nk9.jpg"/></div></div><div class="column w-full"></div></div></div><div id=""><div class="column md:w-10/12 mx-auto xl:w-9/12"><h3><strong><span class="font-bold">Felling a Titan</span></strong></h3><p>Before seeing what the new missions are like, though, we should dig deeper into Titan gameplay and what makes them extra special in the Age of Darkness.

It’s not a completely new set of principles and ideas, but there are cool new elements: Gambits, Tactical Statuses, and so on.</p><p><strong>Neil (Lead writer): </strong>There won’t be much here that changes how your current army works; you might need another Centurion for the new Force Organisation, but that’s about it. Instead, we’ve added more opportunity to exploit weapons and tactics that were not used in previous editions, with tweaked Reactions, Challenges and Gambits, and new Statuses and rules for charging. These also help differentiate the game from other things that we create in the Warhammer studio. This is a longer, more complex, narrative-themed wargame.</p></div></div><div id=""><div class="article-fullWidthImage"><div class="xl:flex flex-col items-end xl-max:out-container xl:w-full mx-auto                 xl:column"><div class="w-full"><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1154" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="w-full" style="color:transparent;object-position:50% 50%" src="https://assets.warhammer-community.com/thh_roundtable3-jul09-image2_wide-q1ris06pgo.jpg"/></div></div><div class="column w-full"></div></div></div><div id=""><div class="column md:w-10/12 mx-auto xl:w-9/12"><h3><strong><span class="font-bold">Profile changes and Advanced Characteristics</span></strong></h3><p><strong>James (Games developer): </strong>The changes to the unit profiles may seem like a lot on the surface but they flow into the new system very well. We reorganised them to feed into the new Tactical Statuses, which have a lot of downstream effects, including making old weapons viable again.</p><p><strong>Neil:</strong> The Advanced Characteristics have their roots way back in Rogue Trader. While the legacy of those rules is important to the Horus Heresy and Warhammer as a whole, nostalgia is not the only reason we&#039;ve brought them back. The true purpose is to give the various leaders, captains and warlords of the Age of Darkness more of a role. </p><p>In previous editions of the game, Leadership covered almost everything outside of pure physical ability, meaning that Praetors were the best at leading troops, resisting psychic powers, engaging with scenery and all the other tasks. This left very little space for other, more specialised, leaders to shine, which often left things like Apothecaries oddly capable as military leaders. </p><p>We can now allow Techmarines to excel at fixing vehicles (Intelligence) without needing an inflated Leadership, while Librarians can be masters of the esoteric (Willpower), and Centurions can steady the line (Cool). It’s about giving breadth to all the characters that populate the stories of the Horus Heresy, a chance for each to be unique, giving them cool specialisations that actually impact gameplay.</p><p>Also it means we can define, once and for all, which Primarch has the most Cool…* </p><p><strong>Andy: </strong>As players get to grips with the new system we expect to see more use of the niche Consuls and characters, as opposed to a single Praetor who could do everything on his own. As with other changes, like the Tactical Statuses, it gives players ways to engage with the battle and their opponent outside of simple slaughter (though World Eaters players can still stick to slaughter if they&#039;d prefer – it’s still one of the main ways to claim victory). Charging across the battlefield to heroically restore a pinned-down Kratos can sometimes be as important as winning a key Challenge.</p><h3><strong><span class="font-bold">Tactical Statuses</span></strong></h3></div></div><div id=""><div class="article-boxOut w-full"><div class="flex items-center justify-center flex-wrap gap-y-30 md:gap-y-40 xl:gap-y-50"><div class="column text-center w-full md:w-4/12 xl:w-6/12"><div class="relative"><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="600" height="619" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="w-full" style="color:transparent;object-position:50% 50%" src="https://assets.warhammer-community.com/thh_roundtable3-jul09-rule1-(1)-qo4r0qn1wq.jpg"/><div class="absolute inset-10 flex flex-col justify-end overflow-hidden opacity-0 invisible"><div class="relative overflow-y-scroll flex"><div class="wysiwyg overflow-y-scroll md-max:m-10 text-left p-10 pr-20 bg-white rounded-[10px] w-full"><p><strong>PINNED</strong></p><p>The Pinned Status reflects a Unit that has been forced to take cover in the</p><p>face of overwhelming firepower or the sudden crack of a sniper’s rifle.</p><p></p><p><strong>SUPPRESSED</strong></p><p>The Suppressed Status reflects a Unit that is distracted and confused by heavy</p><p>enemy fire, environmental effects or psychological warfare.</p><p></p><p><strong>STUNNED</strong></p><p>The Stunned Status reflects a Unit rendered insensible or stopped in its</p><p>tracks by the sheer force of an impact, explosion or other battlefield event.</p><p></p><p><strong>ROUTED</strong></p><p>The Routed Status reflects a Unit that has suffered such a catastrophic reversal</p><p>that it must fall back from the front line in order to regroup and recover.</p><p></p></div><button class="absolute top-20 right-20 md:top-10 md:right-10 p-[2px] rounded-full border" aria-label="Close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewbox="0 0 10 10" class="w-10"><path stroke="currentColor" d="m1 1 8.5 8.5m0-8.5L1 9.5"></path></svg></button></div></div></div><button class="mt-10 copy-bitter-xs py-[2px] px-5 border border-grey-300 rounded-[3px] default-transition hover:bg-stormcastYellow">Read Text</button></div></div></div></div><div id=""><div class="column md:w-10/12 mx-auto xl:w-9/12"><p><strong>James:</strong> There were lots of overlapping small rules – such as Pinning, Blind and Concussive – that articulated the same concept. We boiled them down to three statuses: Stunned, Suppressed and Pinned, and brought Routed into the system too. It now allows you to express all the sorts of things that can happen to troops in a much simpler way, with broader applications. Some troops may be easy to panic but hard to suppress, for instance, which informs what kind of weapons you might deploy against them.</p><p><strong>Neil:</strong> It factors into the narrative: of course flamers should make people run away from combat in sheer panic!</p><p><strong>Andy: </strong>Weapon families weren’t always differentiated well in the previous rules, so that’s something we’ve tried to focus on here. Damage did exist, but was hidden away in the Brutal special rule, so we’ve looked at how to present this information more intuitively. </p><h3><strong><span class="font-bold">Dreadnoughts and Damage</span></strong></h3></div></div><div id=""><div class="article-fullWidthImage"><div class="xl:flex flex-col items-end xl-max:out-container xl:w-full mx-auto                 xl:column"><div class="w-full"><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1000" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="w-full" style="color:transparent;object-position:50% 50%" src="https://assets.warhammer-community.com/thh_roundtable3-jul09-image3_wide-hyi8gn2zte.jpg"/></div></div><div class="column w-full"></div></div></div><div id=""><div class="column md:w-10/12 mx-auto xl:w-9/12"><p><strong>Neil:</strong> Dreadnoughts are a prime example, as the only reliable way to damage them was to chip away at their Wounds. The new <strong>Damage</strong>, <strong>Critical Hits</strong>, and <strong>Heavy </strong>special rule means that a unit of Devastators with autocannons or lascannons can chew them up. </p><p><strong>James:</strong> It makes them more vulnerable to the correct weapons, but still relatively impervious to those weapons that aren&#039;t designed to destroy them.</p><p><strong>Neil:</strong> They have their own advantages – they’re terrifying on the charge, but they also have a uniquely high Cool statistic, so the psychological effects of an artillery bombardment can just be shrugged off. They now have a tactical role, rather than just being versatile and incredibly tough to kill.</p><p><strong>James:</strong> With weapons having their own niches now, I don’t think we’ll see the predicted domination of things like multi-meltas. While they’re excellent at destroying vehicles from close range, the game is won and lost on objectives, and Tactical Squads are a huge part of that. A 10-man multi-melta squad will probably kill half a dozen Space Marines a turn, which means they’re still scoring. If you take anti-infantry weapons which suppress or rout them they won’t score, and that’s a far more efficient use of points.</p><h3><strong><span class="font-bold">Objectives</span></strong></h3></div></div><div id=""><div class="column md:w-10/12 mx-auto xl:w-9/12"><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="749" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="" style="color:transparent;object-position:50% 50%" src="https://assets.warhammer-community.com/thh_roundtable3-jul09-image4-geyle3qohl.jpg"/></div></div><div id=""><div class="column md:w-10/12 mx-auto xl:w-9/12"><p>Tactical Squads were always compulsory for Force Organisation, but they didn’t do much beforehand. Now they’re a key part of your army due to the objectives – as they should be, given the narrative. They now have better damage output with the changes to bolters and <strong>Fury of the Legion</strong>, but with <strong>Line </strong>they become one of the best ways of scoring. I would expect to see three squads in most armies.</p><p><strong>Neil: </strong>They don’t do the most damage compared with some other choices, but they’re primarily there to score VPs and add additional damage here and there.</p><p><strong>James: </strong>They’ll be behind your Terminators and other units with the <strong>Vanguard </strong>special rule, who score points from clearing objectives which the Tactical Marines then capture and provide fire support from. There’s a whole game of paper-scissors-stone, choosing the right units to hold objectives and the right ones to flush them off!</p><h3><strong><span class="font-bold">Hit rolls</span></strong></h3><p><strong>Neil: </strong>The change to Hit rolls is fun. While the maths remains the same, there have been changes to Snap Shots and really high Ballistic Skills. Previously, BS was relevant between two and five, by which point you’re generally already hitting on a 2+. </p><p>We’ve done a lot to give more use to the span of numbers, to bolster Assassins and characters like Exodus. Snap shots now rely on BS; Space Marines used to hit them on a six, but now it’s a five because they’re BS4, whereas Solar Auxilia hit on sixes.</p></div></div><div id=""><div class="column md:w-10/12 mx-auto xl:w-9/12"><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="573" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="" style="color:transparent;object-position:50% 50%" src="https://assets.warhammer-community.com/thh_roundtable3-jul09-image5-srwclqk6yh.jpg"/></div></div><div id=""><div class="column md:w-10/12 mx-auto xl:w-9/12"><p>Models with a BS above six are even better marksmen, hitting on a 2+ and causing a Critical Hit on a 6+ – this offers an extra point of Damage and an automatic Wound. Your marksman characters are now more valuable with that possibility for extra hurt. </p><h3><strong><span class="font-bold">Charges</span></strong></h3><p><strong>James:</strong> We really like the new Charge sub-phase: charges tell a much stronger story, and they’re mechanically more reliable. There are fewer long-bomb 12” charges, but 4-5” inch charges should be more certain, and you don’t get hung out to dry so often.<br><br>Charges are now broken into chunks. You have a set up move, after which you fire your pistols. This has tactical nuance – do you fire and risk killing the closer models? I love that Terminators are bulky enough to use their combi-bolters as pistols on the charge, using the <strong>Assault</strong> special rule. </p></div></div><div id=""><div class="column md:w-10/12 mx-auto xl:w-9/12"><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="573" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="" style="color:transparent;object-position:50% 50%" src="https://assets.warhammer-community.com/thh_roundtable3-jul09-image6-srkisfso0k.jpg"/></div></div><div id=""><div class="column md:w-10/12 mx-auto xl:w-9/12"><p><strong>Neil: </strong>With the previous rules you could describe all that – but now we’ve got steps that involve the initial rush forward, the flamers and other appropriate weapons returning fire, without anything as odd as a pistol giving you an extra power fist attack. </p><p><strong>James: </strong>The weapons in the Contemptor’s power fists now count as assault weapons, so you can fire as the Dreadnought charges in, before it starts swinging. </p><h3><strong><span class="font-bold">Challenges</span></strong></h3><p><strong>Andy: </strong>The Challenge sub-phase is there to provide framing for all these heroic engagements. It’s much more cinematic.</p><p><strong>James:</strong> That was a hook of a lot of the new rules, we wanted to evoke the animations, the lore and the novels. The most memorable parts of the Black Library series are when the Primarchs and other big names fight, like when Sigismund takes on Khârn at the Siege of Terra.</p><p><strong>Neil:</strong> Because Damage didn’t exist in the previous edition, two Primarchs could fight for the entire game.

Sevatar’s underhanded fighting style, where he’ll kick up dirt and stab you before you can even react, adds a lot to the experience.</p><p><strong>Neil:</strong> We didn’t design these characters to be equals, and so they all have pros and cons. Sigismund is meant to be unparalleled, and if he’s fighting anyone other than a Primarch, they’re already in trouble and you’ll need to start stacking benefits in your favour. Erebus has a Gambit that might not win many fights, but will always feel correct for the character…</p><p><strong>James:</strong> Perturabo can just step aside and let his people shoot you.</p><p><strong>Neil: </strong>More than almost anything in the game, Gambits have been designed to propel that narrative forward before we worry about win conditions. Some of the core Gambits are fairly situational: one reduces your efficacy in the challenge, but ensures you get more Victory Points for success. It’s useful in place of performing gratuitous overkill on a Consul!</p></div></div><div id=""><div class="column md:w-10/12 mx-auto xl:w-9/12"><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="554" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="" style="color:transparent;object-position:50% 50%" src="https://assets.warhammer-community.com/thh_roundtable3-jul09-image8-q78dzb5hi7.jpg"/></div></div><div id=""><div class="column md:w-10/12 mx-auto xl:w-9/12"><p>We want people to keep evolving their armies, so if one particular tactic becomes pervasive in your friend’s army, there should be something you can change in your list in order to have a different approach and perhaps a better chance of winning a battle.</p><h3><strong><span class="font-bold">The Rulebook</span></strong><span class="font-bold"> </span></h3><p><strong>Andy:</strong> Better formatting for the rules was a key point from very early on.

Take the MkII Crusade armour, which now actually cleaves much more closely to the original designs from the 80s. That might surprise some people – the resin miniatures people have been familiar with in recent years were an evolution of the original, not the other way around. So here, we&#039;ve gone back to how it was – and yes, they can turn their heads.</p><p><strong>Dave (Content lead): </strong>The leg plates are a conscious decision. We tried a few different iterations of the design, and this one read the best. I feel that the old flared armour had given the impression that it articulated midway down the leg. </p><p>Returning to solid shapes with panel lines keeps it looking more rigid, with standard Space Marine design. It’s not one sophisticated piece of ceramite, it’s fabricated out of parts rather than the contiguous plates of later designs. That design language starts in the MkIII armour, and gets more sophisticated with the MkIV armour.</p></div></div><div id=""><div class="article-carousel w-full"><div class="w-full py-40 xl:py-50            bg-apothecaryWhite text-grimDarkBlack            out-container xl:!w-[120vw]"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="column w-full md:w-8/12 xl:w-7/12 mx-auto"><div class="mb-20"><div class="swiper !overflow-visible"><div class="swiper-wrapper"><div class="swiper-slide article-carousel__slide !h-auto"><div class="swiper-zoom-container h-full relative article-carousel__slideInner default-transition"><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="900" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="w-full mb-20" style="color:transparent;object-position:50% 50%" src="https://assets.warhammer-community.com/thh_roundtable2-jul08-carousela_1-j44qs3lbqn.png"/></div></div><div class="swiper-slide article-carousel__slide !h-auto"><div class="swiper-zoom-container h-full relative article-carousel__slideInner default-transition"><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="900" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="w-full mb-20" style="color:transparent;object-position:50% 50%" src="https://assets.warhammer-community.com/thh_roundtable2-jul08-carousela_2-bh1ntgjln2.png"/></div></div><div class="swiper-slide article-carousel__slide !h-auto"><div class="swiper-zoom-container h-full relative article-carousel__slideInner default-transition"><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="900" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="w-full mb-20" style="color:transparent;object-position:50% 50%" src="https://assets.warhammer-community.com/thh_roundtable2-jul08-carousela_3-exrc33pvkq.png"/></div></div><div class="swiper-slide article-carousel__slide !h-auto"><div class="swiper-zoom-container h-full relative article-carousel__slideInner default-transition"><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="900" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="w-full mb-20" style="color:transparent;object-position:50% 50%" src="https://assets.warhammer-community.com/thh_roundtable2-jul08-carousela_4-bwttliwajj.png"/></div></div></div></div></div><div class="flex items-center justify-between mt-30 xl-max:justify-center"><div class="article-carousel--pagination article-carousel--pagination--3"></div><div class="shared-swiperNav flex space-x-5 xl-max:hidden theme-light"><button class="swiper-nav swiper-prev swiper-nav--small" aria-label="Previous slide"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="1.5" class="arrow_svg__size-6" viewbox="0 0 24 24"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M10.5 19.5 3 12m0 0 7.5-7.5M3 12h18"></path></svg></button><button class="swiper-nav swiper-next swiper-nav--small" aria-label="Next slide"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="1.5" class="arrow_svg__size-6" viewbox="0 0 24 24"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M10.5 19.5 3 12m0 0 7.5-7.5M3 12h18"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id=""><div class="column md:w-10/12 mx-auto xl:w-9/12"><p><strong>Mark (Concept artist):</strong> Ultimately we’re all longtime fans of this stuff ourselves, and some of us remember it from the very beginning, so it’s not surprising we’re looking back into Warhammer history for our new designs.</p><p><strong>Dave: </strong>The Horus Heresy fanbase enjoys the history, and not just the history of the lore – they love the history of the miniatures as well. The origins of a lot of key designs are quite old, and we keep going back to them because people remember them fondly.</p><p><strong>Andy:</strong> It&#039;s the same thing with the Rapier crew. We thought it would be a fruitless exercise to do MkII, MkIII, MkIV, MkV and MkVI crew packs, so we decided to make a unique pattern that a specialist artillery crew would use. To give it a pedigree in that setting, and within the company’s history, we drew off the original Imperial Space Marine, the LE02, which was remade in 2016 to celebrate 30 years of Space Marines.</p><p>This means we’re not springing something completely new on people, and when they don’t recognise something, older fans can explain how it’s really been there since the beginning.

The nearest equivalent we have at the moment is volkite, which is much older weaponry that’s in use primarily by the Martians prior to the Great Crusade. It was in use elsewhere before, but has fallen out of favour by the time of the Great Crusade, replaced by tech that’s easier to replicate and maintain. </p><p>Disintegrator weapons go back further still. These are old weapons from before the Wars of Unity, from the Golden Age of Humanity. They were phased out because they’re strange tech which is hard to make, because those who use them eventually meet a horrible end, and because they’re a terrifying piece of wargear – too much even for the Emperor and His Thunder Warriors, which says a lot. The knowledge to manufacture it does still exist in this time period, but it is something the Emperor intentionally steps away from… while certain Legions continue to make use of it. </p></div></div><div id=""><div class="article-fullWidthImage"><div class="xl:flex flex-col items-end xl-max:out-container xl:w-full mx-auto                 xl:column"><div class="w-full"><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1000" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="w-full" style="color:transparent;object-position:50% 50%" src="https://assets.warhammer-community.com/thh_roundtable2-jul08-image4_wide-yt5xntxrfb.jpg"/></div></div><div class="column w-full"></div></div></div><div id=""><div class="column md:w-10/12 mx-auto xl:w-9/12"><p>Much like Saturnine armour, the Mechanicum doesn’t like any of this tech, but Mars is pointedly not paying attention to it, so they don’t have to raise official sanctions. They don’t build it or even recognise it as proper technology, and the Emperor is quite happy with that. He has a specific collection of weaponry that He keeps out of wider use, in case an element of the Imperium – perhaps like the Mechanicum – goes rogue. They don’t understand how it works, so they don’t have countermeasures in place. </p><p><strong>Andy: </strong>Adrathic weapons are basically the same.</p><p><strong>Neil:</strong> Exactly, the adrathic weapons of the Custodes are safer versions of the disintegration weapons. The technology is unknown anywhere outside of Terra, and the only people who know how it works are the Emperor, and a few very old people whom Malcador likely has locked up somewhere, who are probably building the guns. Perhaps it’s linked to when the Emperor took over the tech-enclave on Luna… we may never know.</p></div></div><div id=""><div class="column md:w-10/12 mx-auto xl:w-9/12"><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="542" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="" style="color:transparent;object-position:50% 50%" src="https://assets.warhammer-community.com/thh_roundtable2-jul08-image5-d4ugztmtn1.jpg"/></div></div><div id=""><div class="column md:w-10/12 mx-auto xl:w-9/12"><p>Disintegrators are in heavy use throughout the Unification Wars, often by those factions fighting the Space Marines (who do also use them before they are sidelined). The Space Wolves likely retained some, while the Dark Angels almost certainly kept a big stockpile, and Horus probably put some aside in case he ever had to wage a war against an unexpected foe. Ultimately it’s only really used during the Great Crusade under extraordinary circumstances.</p><p><strong>Andy:</strong> In terms of Warhammer history, LE02 came out in 1986, a year before Rogue Trader. It was the first Space Marine miniature, and he was carrying an unidentified gun. By the time the next Space Marines were released, their weapons were already bolters, and LE02’s weapon disappeared for three decades. We recreated him in plastic for the 30th anniversary of that first Space Marine, which I believe is the first time his weapon was named a disintegrator gun and had a profile.</p></div></div><div id=""><div class="column md:w-10/12 mx-auto xl:w-9/12"><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="725" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="" style="color:transparent;object-position:50% 50%" src="https://assets.warhammer-community.com/thh_roundtable2-jul08-image6-68m7hdeto9.jpg"/></div></div><div id=""><div class="column md:w-10/12 mx-auto xl:w-9/12"><p><strong>Neil:</strong> You get quite a few in the Saturnine box, and they can be equipped by Veteran Squads. The research done on these weapons during the Age of Unity has allowed for a slightly less dangerous version to be put in use – we didn’t want to put something too overpowering into the game!</p><p>So the basic weapon becomes the disintegrator rifle, a weapon that’s not as all-consumingly destructive as the originals. There’s a limiter that prevents it being used to its full catastrophic potential.</p><p><strong>James:</strong> We had included a profile for a disintegrator in previous editions of the game and it was an incredibly powerful weapon, but that’s now tempered by seven variants. These include the older ones, which are super rare and especially powerful, all the way through to more common issue. They’re still powerful – they’ll kill a Space Marine – but they’re not unchecked.</p><p><strong>Neil: </strong>The older weapons still exist. Veteran Squads can take a few, while Praetors and Consuls can carry the original disintegrator pistols.</p><p><strong>James: </strong>We wanted them to fit into their own niche, with a weapon family much like plasma or volkite. Each version has a distinct profile, with a utility that gives you a reason to take them.</p></div></div><div id=""><div class="article-fullWidthImage"><div class="xl:flex flex-col items-end xl-max:out-container xl:w-full mx-auto                 xl:column"><div class="w-full"><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1000" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="w-full" style="color:transparent;object-position:50% 50%" src="https://assets.warhammer-community.com/thh_roundtable2-jul08-image7_wide-pgmk4xqogu.jpg"/></div></div><div class="column w-full"></div></div></div><div id=""><div class="column md:w-10/12 mx-auto xl:w-9/12"><p><strong>Mark:</strong> There is a unique silhouette to the disintegrator.

It’s incredibly important to the rest of the story, and it’s an event that we trusted everyone in the fanbase would recognise and enjoy exploring.</p><p>We made the first mockup of the Saturnine Terminators even before the 2022 Age of Darkness Boxed Set hit the shelves. We knew we would need something big and impressive in the new box, and as this is a quasi-historical game we didn’t want to pluck something out of thin air – just like the fans, we want to make sure everything feels rooted in the lore.. Saturnine Terminators had been mentioned in a black book* and in a Black Library novel, so they were the perfect choice.</p></div></div><div id=""><div class="article-fullWidthImage"><div class="xl:flex flex-col items-end xl-max:out-container xl:w-full mx-auto                 xl:column"><div class="w-full"><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1327" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="w-full" style="color:transparent;object-position:50% 50%" src="https://assets.warhammer-community.com/thh_roundtable1-jul07-image2_wide-cbsctqowjj.jpg"/></div></div><div class="column w-full"></div></div></div><div id=""><div class="column md:w-10/12 mx-auto xl:w-9/12"><p>The armour design is much older than that, however. We released what is now the classic pattern of Terminator armour – which we refer to as Indomitus – back in the 80s for Space Hulk.** During that project, three further miniature prototypes were made. One would be what became Saturnine, another has a strange hood and is sometimes referred to by fans as Cobra pattern, while the third looks like an Indomitus Terminator with a MkVII helmet. These were released as curios for fans who might enjoy them, but were never intended to be different types or a range. </p></div></div><div id=""><div class="column md:w-10/12 mx-auto xl:w-9/12"><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="663" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="" style="color:transparent;object-position:50% 50%" src="https://assets.warhammer-community.com/thh_roundtable1-jul07-image3-jarpqwyn1g.jpg"/></div></div><div id=""><div class="column md:w-10/12 mx-auto xl:w-9/12"><p><strong>Chris W</strong> <strong>(concept artist):</strong> The casting technique used for the original metal Saturnine miniature created that distinctive curved shape more than I think the intent had been, but it did get stuck in the collective memory. </p><p>There are other Terminators from this era, too. The plastic miniatures for the original Space Hulk were of the Indomitus pattern, but had a notable Saturnine-style curve to their pauldrons. We then released a box of metal Terminators which had the familiar modern silhouette, accompanied by a Librarian with a distinctive force hood and even an Inquisitor with a bionic leg and a ponytail.</p><p><strong>Andy:</strong> We were conscious early on that we had the opportunity to show something big and impressive -- Saturnine pattern is Terminator armour plus.</p><p><strong>James G (games developer):</strong> We looked at the weapon loadouts first of all to define a battlefield role. They have a melee weapon – the fists – but they are slower than other Terminators. So we focused on that ponderousness, and with dual ranged weapons they become a fire support option, who tend to be following behind your line, rather than at the forefront. </p><p>We wanted to play up esoteric technology like the thermal diffraction field which is part of their construction. They’re not Martian tech, they’re from Phoebe – a different tech canon. </p><p><strong>Neil (lead writer):</strong> You can read some of this in the upcoming Journals Tactica, where information is scattered throughout about their origins and designs. They may be new to readers, but they’re not new to the universe, and there will be more written about their place in the setting in future books. </p></div></div><div id=""><div class="article-carousel w-full"><div class="w-full py-40 xl:py-50            bg-grimDarkBlack text-white            out-container xl:!w-[120vw]"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="column w-full md:w-8/12 xl:w-7/12 mx-auto"><div class="mb-20"><div class="swiper !overflow-visible"><div class="swiper-wrapper"><div class="swiper-slide article-carousel__slide !h-auto"><div class="swiper-zoom-container h-full relative article-carousel__slideInner default-transition"><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="1000" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="w-full mb-20" style="color:transparent;object-position:50% 50%" src="https://assets.warhammer-community.com/thh_roundtable1-jul07-carousela_1-9qjcznetwj.png"/></div></div><div class="swiper-slide article-carousel__slide !h-auto"><div class="swiper-zoom-container h-full relative article-carousel__slideInner default-transition"><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="1000" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="w-full mb-20" style="color:transparent;object-position:50% 50%" src="https://assets.warhammer-community.com/thh_roundtable1-jul07-carousela_3-x1sfxfp4h5.png"/></div></div><div class="swiper-slide article-carousel__slide !h-auto"><div class="swiper-zoom-container h-full relative article-carousel__slideInner default-transition"><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="1000" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="w-full mb-20" style="color:transparent;object-position:50% 50%" src="https://assets.warhammer-community.com/thh_roundtable1-jul07-carousela_2-qyhut1ozt2.png"/></div></div></div></div></div><div class="flex items-center justify-between mt-30 xl-max:justify-center"><div class="article-carousel--pagination article-carousel--pagination--7"></div><div class="shared-swiperNav flex space-x-5 xl-max:hidden theme-dark"><button class="swiper-nav swiper-prev swiper-nav--small" aria-label="Previous slide"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="1.5" class="arrow_svg__size-6" viewbox="0 0 24 24"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M10.5 19.5 3 12m0 0 7.5-7.5M3 12h18"></path></svg></button><button class="swiper-nav swiper-next swiper-nav--small" aria-label="Next slide"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="1.5" class="arrow_svg__size-6" viewbox="0 0 24 24"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M10.5 19.5 3 12m0 0 7.5-7.5M3 12h18"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id=""><div class="column md:w-10/12 mx-auto xl:w-9/12"><p>The tech split goes back a long way though, to Old Night when the Emperor was trapped in the Sol system.

We’ll also see how legions like the Space Wolves use them, or the White Scars – given they have a different tactical doctrine.</p><p><strong>Andy:</strong> You can expect a lot of calls to kitbash in the Journals.

Rules are coming in the second Journal Tactica.</p><p><strong>Andy: </strong>As Saturnine Terminators date back to the Dark Age of Technology, they are all equipped with types of energy weapons.

This also helps out a great deal with sub-assemblies for painting. </p><p><strong>Andy: </strong>We also wanted to exceed the Spartan and Contemptor from the previous Age of Darkness box, so we went big, extrapolating from the Saturnine Terminator design.</p><p><strong>Chris W:</strong> After the idea came in, I responded with a bunch of sketches and concepts, ending up at something that could easily be described as a Knight’s baby brother. </p><p><strong>Andy:</strong> The Saturnine Dreadnought is part of the same tech canon as the Terminators, but is a relatively new introduction. </p><p><strong>James:</strong> This is something that Vulkan develops from data within the original Saturnine designs, a Dreadnought version that the artificers of Phoebe could never quite get to work. The Terminators existed early on in the Great Crusade but it proved impossible to manufacture them in the quantities needed, so they were abandoned in favour of Tartaros and Cataphractii patterns, while the Dreadnought remained unworkable with the technology of the time. Later, Vulkan goes “I reckon I can nail it…” The design is quite old, but with new technologies discovered during the Great Crusade and the genius of the Master of Nocturne, Vulkan brings it to life in time to fight at Isstvan V.</p></div></div><div id=""><div class="column md:w-10/12 mx-auto xl:w-9/12"><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="1033" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="" style="color:transparent;object-position:50% 50%" src="https://assets.warhammer-community.com/thh_roundtable1-jul07-image5-2gkrscqqdf.jpg"/></div></div><div id=""><div class="column md:w-10/12 mx-auto xl:w-9/12"><p><strong>Chris D (miniatures designer):</strong> There was some work done to bring in design language from the existing Leviathan Dreadnought and marry it with the Saturnine Terminator design. The idea is to bring them together to show a common lineage between the designs, but to make them look a little more prototypical on the Saturnine Dreadnought, rather than the refined visuals of the Contemptor.</p><p><strong>Neil:</strong> By Isstvan V there are barely any of these suits left, and it’s only Vulkan’s involvement that brings them back into service. After years of brutal warfare, Saturnine suits are unlikely to have survived much past the end of the Horus Heresy.</p><p>Just as with the Kratos, which were old, mothballed tanks dragged back into use for the Heresy, Saturnine suits are a relic which don’t chime with Guilliman’s desire for rapid warfare. They are a throwback the Emperor was using to defeat the horrors of Old Night, and they have no place in the new <em>Codex Astartes</em>.</p><p><strong>James:</strong> It’s essentially a mid-range brawler, designed to destroy whatever it can get within range of – which it will do with enthusiasm. It’s not specialised; a Deredeo will probably win out at longer range, while a Levitathan will take it in a pitched close combat fight.</p></div></div><div id=""><div class="column md:w-10/12 mx-auto xl:w-9/12"><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="1182" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="" style="color:transparent;object-position:50% 50%" src="https://assets.warhammer-community.com/thh_roundtable1-jul07-image6-4q8zycuxe9.jpg"/></div></div><div id=""><div class="column md:w-10/12 mx-auto xl:w-9/12"><p>We got Chris W to concept all sorts of esoteric energy weapons for us, ones that didn’t necessarily map onto existing weapons – and then picked the ones we liked the most and worked to map them into familiar visual language.

Both the Questoris and Cerastus chassis of Knight have the <strong>Vanguard (X) </strong>special rule, allowing them to score victory points for destroying or routing enemy units holding objectives. </p><p>This can of course put them in hazardous positions, but as most Knights have good frontal armour, it means you are immune to small-arms fire when well positioned. Knights are not invincible however, and they can be brought crashing down if you’re not aware of their surroundings.</p><h3><strong><span class="font-bold">Household Paradigms</span></strong></h3><p>The way you build a Questoris Familia army has changed. No longer do you have to take Armigers to unlock the larger Knights, so players have more freedom to include all their favourite patterns. </p><p>When building a list you pick a Household type: Imperialis, Mechanicum or Mendicant. Each has a unique set of bonuses, including a <strong>Tactica</strong>, a <strong>Vow </strong>and an <strong>Advanced Reaction</strong>.</p></div></div><div id=""><div class="column md:w-10/12 mx-auto xl:w-9/12"><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="673" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="" style="color:transparent;object-position:50% 50%" src="https://assets.warhammer-community.com/thh_knightstitansrules-jul04-image2-c9h0okrjwz.jpg"/></div></div><div id=""><div class="column md:w-10/12 mx-auto xl:w-9/12"><h3><strong><span class="font-bold">Household hierarchy</span></strong></h3><p>The second thing to note is that Knights have a unique Primary Detachment which is used instead of the Crusade Primary Detachment. It doesn’t allow Allies, but it does permit more Lords of War choices, while each slot is a Prime slot, allowing every Knight to choose a <strong>Unique Prime Advantage</strong>. </p><p>There are plenty of these to choose from, representing the various ranks within the households. For example, <strong>Lord Scion </strong>allows a Knight to make two repair rolls at the end of their turn.

Since you love the sound of your own voices so dearly, you can debate philosophy until the oceans dry.’</p><p>Odhem frowned, but there was the hint of a smile on his face. Ainhurr had always liked the Soulscryer, despite his companion’s tendency towards introspection. Theirs was a comradeship uncommon amongst the Deepkin. Martial-minded Akhelians seldom regarded those of the Isharann order as anything other than rivals, for the balance of power between the two social classes was a tenuous thing. But King Ainhurr had always appreciated Odhem’s quick wit and respected his willingness to give voice to ideas others would gladly have consigned to the deepest trenches of the abyss.</p><p>‘What would you have me do?’ the Akhelian said. ‘Call back my warriors? Send them back to the enclave with naught but honourable intentions as comfort? Every year more of our children are born to the withering. If we do not hunt for souls, we diminish.’</p><p>‘Do not mistake my words for a land-dweller’s weakness,’ said Odhem. ‘My own hands are stained with blood. For centuries, I have sifted the tides for potent spirits and led you to them. And here we are once more, trapped together in a moment of necessity.’</p><p>‘So we agree.’</p><p>‘We do not. I speak of our people’s future, not one raid.’</p><p>Ainhurr spread his palms wide in a gesture of invitation.</p><p>‘You know another way, Soulscryer? Speak now and I will listen.’</p><p>‘I do not. But neither have I been given the remit to search. Neither have any of my order truly dedicated themselves to the pursuit of another path. A better path. And in all that time, look at what others have accomplished. Morathi-Khaine has seized the mantle of godhood. True ascension! The lord of the humans has wrought immortal warriors from the tapestry of the heavens, and his armies hold the Ruinous Ones at bay. Even Teclis the Creator has reinvigorated his fallen empire. But we remain content to exist in stasis. As cursed things, feeding on stolen souls.’</p><p>Ainhurr said nothing, contemplating Odhem’s speech – implicit condemnation of a way of life that was all the Idoneth had known for centuries. The only reason it was not blasphemy to speak in such a way is that so few Idoneth would think to do so. Yet for all his instinctive aversion to the Soulscryer’s words, he could not deny that they troubled him.</p><p>‘I ask this,’ Odhem said softly. ‘Every time we kill to prolong our own lives, do we not prove the Creator right? Do we not reveal ourselves as the very monsters he sought to destroy? I would sooner embrace oblivion than do that.’</p><p>‘And I would not,’ King Ainhurr said firmly. ‘I will gladly sacrifice my own honour if it means a future for our people, however harsh and violent it must be.’</p><p>In silence, they watched the Namarti advance, climbing hand over hand to scale the rain-lashed cliffs, letting the rising currents of the ethersea ease their ascent. In the silvery light of twin Ghyranite moons, they looked like pale wraiths. Above the cliffs lay the enemy’s warcamp, and from their concealed position in a shadowy cleft in the rock face, Odhem and Ainhurr could see the outlines of sentries silhouetted against the sky. None of them had more than a few moments to live.</p><p>‘Tonight’s raid will be a bountiful one,’ said King Ainhurr.</p><p>‘Yes,’ said Odhem. ‘Yes, I think it will.’</p></div></div><div id=""><div class="column md:w-10/12 mx-auto xl:w-9/12"><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="437" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="" style="color:transparent;object-position:50% 50%" src="https://assets.warhammer-community.com/aos_idonethfiction-jul04-filler1-lpaae9mdkm.jpg"/></div></div><div id=""><div class="column md:w-10/12 mx-auto xl:w-9/12"><p>At first, it seemed that Odhem was right.</p><p>The enemy appeared reckless, perhaps glutted by one too many easy victories. Their sentries were lax, some of them hopelessly drunk. The wretches died one by one without even knowing they were attacked, as the sea-mists rolled in and Namarti arrows whipped silently into eyes and throats. None made a sound as they fell.</p><p>The great bank of opaque clouds curled over the lip of the cliffs and swept silently down on the foe’s tents. Not all of the warlike humans were caught off guard. Indeed, the shouts of alarm now came swiftly, echoed throughout the encampment. Yet no warriors – no matter how formidable – could outrun the ethersea. Enervating magic from the ocean depths rolled over cooking fires, extinguishing them.</p><p>It swept up bands of bleary-eyed killers, who stumbled in a daze, hypnotised by the billowing mass. It sapped the wits, filled mortal minds with half-glimpsed images to incite horror and helplessness. Most of all, it masked King Ainhurr’s Phalanx until they were on their prey.</p><p>The Akhelian King led atop his Deepmare steed Maloth, plunging into the heart of the enemy with his sabre lashing out to cut down enemies left and right. His Ishlaen Guard swept in at his side, and their Fangmora Eels hissed in delight as the ethersea was stained with freshly spilled blood. Even as the first stunned victims of the raid collapsed, souls already leaving their torn bodies as they were drawn towards the lurelights held by Soulrenders, the Namarti formations came sweeping in, Reavers loosing arrows on the charge as their frontline brethren lashed out with curved lanmari blades.</p><p>‘Sea-aelves!’ a bearded warrior cried, before Ainhurr’s sword sliced through his throat and silenced him forever.</p><p>These were hard creatures, these scarred and tattooed killers. They raided as the Idoneth did, although their own rewards were base plunder and carnage. Their souls would be damaged things, and the Dark Gods would not part with their tribute easily. But at least they were still human. Still clinging to their fragile mortality, even as they dangled on the precipice of self-immolation. They were not yet so tainted by malignance as to be valueless, and so their souls were reaped without mercy.</p><p>‘Encircle them,’ ordered Ainhurr. ‘Let none escape.’</p><p>His Ishlaen moved to obey, corralling the enemy within a ring of crackling energy that danced around the flanks of their aquatic mounts. Ainhurr fought and slew until his arm throbbed with agony from blow after killing blow. But even as the enemy perished, something unpleasant struck him. Was this all that the enemy could muster? Even the most vague reports from his Namarti scouts had suggested their numbers would be greater. Where were the rest?</p><p>It was then that the harsh boom of war-horns split the air. They seemed to echo from all around, and now the obscuring mists of the ethersea impeded the Idoneth’s vision where before they had aided their advance. King Ainhurr could hear the tramping of boots and the demented, baying howls of the things that dwelt in the realms’ benighted corners.</p><p>‘My King?’ asked Lagainne, his Ishlaen captain, the normally impassive aelf’s words shot through with unease.</p><p>‘They knew we were coming,’ muttered Ainhurr. ‘Somehow they knew. They were waiting for us.’</p><p>Lagainne opened his mouth to speak, but something fell from the sky and slammed through his coralline armour, pinning him to the saddle of his fangmora. The enraged beast bucked and writhed, and Lagainne’s limp body sagged, held in place by the black haft of a javelin. Shapes emerged from the fog on all sides: no addled and drunken warriors these, but dark champions clad from head to toe in ensorcelled plate and holding aloft icons of the thrice-damned gods.</p><p>‘To me, Morrsarr!’ Ainhurr cried, and his eel-riders gathered into a spearhead, armour crackling as it channelled the bio-electricity of their eager mounts. Ainhurr’s heels struck Maloth’s flank, ordering the Deepmare into a headlong charge, and the Fangmora Eels followed at pace, darting towards the approaching block of swords, shields and hate-filled faces. They struck in a strobing eruption of lightning that sent ruin-worshippers reeling, half-blinded as their flesh smoked and burned. Ainhurr drove his helsabre into one horned fiend’s face, and Maloth reared to disembowel another with his raking claws.</p><p>Then the enemy recovered their senses and closed their ranks, and the true slaughter began.</p></div></div><div id=""><div class="column md:w-10/12 mx-auto xl:w-9/12"><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="437" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="" style="color:transparent;object-position:50% 50%" src="https://assets.warhammer-community.com/aos_idonethfiction-jul04-filler2-dyhiskhgag.jpg"/></div></div><div id=""><div class="column md:w-10/12 mx-auto xl:w-9/12"><p>By the time that the enemy was driven from the field, it was clear that Dhom-hain would not profit from this soul-raid. Too many Namarti had fallen, their bodies heaped atop the corpses of those they had come here to harvest. Though the Chaos counter-ambush had been thrown back, many of the souls reaped in the brutal, close-quarters fighting were too soiled by corruption to be of use to the Isharann.</p><p>Their own losses were a bitter wound that would not easily heal.</p><p>‘How did they know?’ said Odhem. The words were hard to pick out, masked as they were by the blood bubbling in his throat.</p><p>Ainhurr sighed. ‘Impossible to say. But we are not the only raiding Phalanx to be ambushed in these bitter times. Our ways are known to the land-dwellers now. Even your Isharann magic cannot conceal our every secret.’</p><p>‘They lured us,’ Odhem rasped, then made a sound that might have been a sharp, bitter laugh. It ended in a wracking cough that scattered droplets of blood across his robes.</p><p>King Ainhurr knelt by his dying comrade. A splinter from a ruin-knight’s lance had pierced the Soulscryer through the ribcage, and the wound was beyond the efforts of any healer to mend. In truth, Ainhurr had no idea how his friend was still capable of speech at all. The aelf’s ruined torso had been dressed with kelp-woven bandages and salves made from the egg sacs of diamondhead sharks, but all that could do was make the Soulscryer’s last moments somewhat more bearable.</p><p>‘Do you see why we must change?’ Odhem asked. ‘Do you see why this existence can only lead to our doom? The realms are closing in upon us, my friend. Our deeds can no longer be kept hidden, even by our most powerful magic. We are known. We are seen. We evolved once, to survive annihilation. We must do so again.’</p><p>‘Be still,’ said Ainhurr.</p><p>Odhem snarled in pain, a crude sound coming from the soft-spoken Isharann.</p><p>‘I am dying,’ he said. ‘But I pass my doubts, my fears to you.’</p><p>‘I am no philosopher. I am a warrior. What am I to do with doubt?’</p><p>The Soulscryer seized Ainhurr by the neck, his nails digging painfully into exposed skin. His eyes narrowed, and with his teeth bloodstained and gritted tight, he had a feral, unsettling look. It was taboo for any Idoneth to lay their hands upon a comrade so, and Ainhurr was so shocked he knew not how to react.</p><p>‘Think,’ snarled Odhem. ‘Feel. Ask yourself what is the right course, and what is merely convenient. The time is coming when the Idoneth will face a choice, perhaps the most important one in our long and tragic history. Your duty as an Akhelian King – as a leader – is to ensure we walk the right path.’</p><p>Then, with a shudder, the Isharann was gone. His hand fell limply from Ainhurr’s throat. The Akhelian King looked to the sky, where the first slivers of Hysh’s radiance were spearing through the clouds, casting the battlefield in golden light. Grief was an indulgence that the Idoneth could seldom afford to partake in, but still, Odhem’s passing left an ache at his core. He felt as though there was some sane reaction he must now perform, some ritual of remembrance or other symbolic gesture. But he could not imagine what that might be, and so he simply stared at the dead Isharann.</p><p>‘Sire?’ said one of Odhem’s retinue, a gaunt woman dressed in silver kelpweave robes. Had she overhead them? It was no crime to speak as Odhem had, but most Akhelians or Isharann would consider his words lunacy.</p><p>‘Be about your work,’ said Ainhurr, closing Odhem’s eyes. ‘The Soulrenders have many souls to claim if we are to balance the day’s losses.’</p><p>He was not yet ready to face the harshest truths. Nor, he knew, were his people. There would come a time for philosophising, perhaps, but not while the enclaves teetered on the brink of ruin. For now, King Ainhurr would live with his sins.</p><p>And yet even as he made his heart cold and focused on the task at hand, the Akhelian heard his friend’s final words ringing in the back of his mind. He suspected he always would.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><em>The Idoneth Deepkin hit pre-orders tomorrow, with a new battletome, a new Spearhead box, a new special character, new Manifestations, and two new Heroes.

After that I used various thinned down shade colours across different materials. The last thing I did was “outline” them, essentially edge highlighting them with a very dark brown to give the illusion that they were drawn.

Varying the use of a single colour across each miniature was a fun exercise, especially with all the layers to the Grand Cathay armour. I had an unfortunate accident with the banner on the mounted Gate Master, so excuse the wonky repair. The transfer was also a challenge, as I&#039;ve never worked with one so large, and I got a fair amount of silvering under it. If I did it again I’d take more care – don’t rush it, and maybe not try and do it in a tiny, overly warm office in the middle of summer. </p><h3><strong><span class="font-bold">Chris – Granite Sentinel and Jade Warrior Champion</span></strong></h3></div></div><div id=""><div class="column md:w-10/12 mx-auto xl:w-9/12"><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="1000" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="" style="color:transparent;object-position:50% 50%" src="https://assets.warhammer-community.com/tow_teamcathay-jul04-chris1-8rfbnnjzqb.jpg"/></div></div><div id=""><div class="column md:w-10/12 mx-auto xl:w-9/12"><p>Hailing from Aberdeen, which is known as the Granite City, as soon as I saw a Granite Sentinel listed in the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.warhammer.com/shop/arcane-journal-armies-of-grand-cathay-2025-eng?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=warhammer-community.com"><u>Arcane Journal</u></a>, I knew immediately that was what I would challenge myself to achieve.</p><p>The paint scheme was pretty simple: an undercoat of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.warhammer.com/shop/Chaos-Black-Spray-UK-ROW-2020?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=warhammer-community.com"><u>Chaos Black spray</u></a> hit with smaller, top-down sprays of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.warhammer.com/shop/Grey-Seer-Spray-UK-ROW-2020?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=warhammer-community.com"><u>Grey Seer</u></a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.warhammer.com/shop/white-scar-spray-paint-2022-row?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=warhammer-community.com"><u>White Scar</u></a>, then lots of drybrushing and stippling.</p><p>For the base, I used some air-dry clay to create a lava-like texture and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.warhammer.com/shop/Aethermatic-Blue-2019?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=warhammer-community.com"><u>Aethermatic Blue</u></a> Contrast paint was used to fill in the recesses and paint the gems, which I covered with a layer of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.warhammer.com/shop/Technical-Ardcoat-2019?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=warhammer-community.com"><u>Ardcoat</u></a> to give a glassy finish.</p></div></div><div id=""><div class="column md:w-10/12 mx-auto xl:w-9/12"><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="658" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="" style="color:transparent;object-position:50% 50%" src="https://assets.warhammer-community.com/tow_teamcathay-jul04-chris2-8mhwlq7rfh.jpg"/></div></div><div id=""><div class="column md:w-10/12 mx-auto xl:w-9/12"><p>For the Jade Warrior Champion, I wanted to keep it simple – Contrast paints, metallics, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.warhammer.com/shop/shade-nuln-oil-18ml-2022?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=warhammer-community.com"><u>Nuln Oil</u></a> – but the base had to be pure nostalgia, with artificial grass made from torn-up <a target="_blank" href="https://www.warhammer.com/shop/citadel-colour-tufts-verdia-veldt-2021?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=warhammer-community.com"><u>Verdia Veldt Tufts</u></a> and a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.warhammer.com/shop/Layer-Warboss-Green-2019?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=warhammer-community.com"><u>Warboss Green</u></a> rim.</p><h3><strong><span class="font-bold">James – Warpstone Sentinel</span></strong></h3></div></div><div id=""><div class="column md:w-10/12 mx-auto xl:w-9/12"><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="885" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="" style="color:transparent;object-position:50% 50%" src="https://assets.warhammer-community.com/tow_teamcathay-jul04-james1-uzjmnnwr0y.jpg"/></div></div><div id=""><div class="column md:w-10/12 mx-auto xl:w-9/12"><p>As a Skaven enthusiast, my whiskers immediately started twitching when I saw the Warpstone Sentinel in the Arcane Journal.<br><br>I wanted a simple way to paint it that gave a very varied look to the stone, so I used multiple Contrast paints, layered over each other to exaggerate their effect.

Here’s playtester Al to explain more about how they work in the new edition.</em></p><p><strong>Al:</strong> The Solar Auxilia are the elite of the Imperial Army, and they work best when combining infantry, artillery and armour. They have some of the toughest armoured vehicles in the game, including the Leman Russ and its fearsome frontal armour, which can be included in large numbers. </p></div></div><div id=""><div class="column md:w-10/12 mx-auto xl:w-9/12"><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="1253" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="" style="color:transparent;object-position:50% 50%" src="https://assets.warhammer-community.com/thh_auxrules-jul03-pic2-0wkdqfgyfr.jpg"/></div></div><div id=""><div class="column md:w-10/12 mx-auto xl:w-9/12"><p>They also have widespread access to some very powerful artillery, with Basilisk and Medusas’ main guns clocking in at Ranged Strength 10 when they remain stationary. The Earthshaker cannon on the Basilisk has the ability to crack any armour with<strong> Breaching (6+)</strong>, and it can also stop enemy units in their tracks with <strong>Pinning (1)</strong>. </p><p>But the Solar Auxilia isn’t <em>just</em> about vehicles. Whilst each individual Auxiliary isn’t a match for a Space Marine, they are half the points cost and outrange the bolter with their trusty lasrifles.</p><h3><strong><span class="font-bold">Cohort Doctrines</span></strong></h3><p>Most of the Solar Auxilia list will feel familiar to veteran commanders. However there are big changes in the Command Sections, Detachments and Cohort rules. </p><p>Solar Auxilia have a number of different <strong>Command Sections</strong>, each of which provide buffs to corresponding units. As an example, the Line Command Section increases the value of the <strong>Line (X)</strong> special rule for friendly units within line of sight of the Troop Master. This is an important lynchpin in your Solar Auxilia army. However, you have to make sure to protect them as they can be vulnerable to attack. </p><p>The old Tercios are now <strong>Auxiliary Detachments</strong> unlocked by the corresponding Command Section. For example, a Line Command Section allows you to take the<strong> </strong>Infantry Tercio, which allows you to build around Lasrifle Sections and Dracosans. Combining the different Tercios is the most effective way to build a combined arms force. </p><p>Each type of Cohort also has additional rules now in the form of <strong>Cohort Doctrines</strong>. Each of these is built around a different style of play and corresponds to the main Solar Auxilia units, giving them bonuses and making them easier to take en masse. My current favourite is the Reconnaissance Pattern Cohort, which allows Hermes Sentinel units to hold and contest objectives.</p></div></div><div id=""><div class="article-boxOut w-full"><div class="flex items-center justify-center flex-wrap gap-y-30 md:gap-y-40 xl:gap-y-50"><div class="column text-center w-full md:w-4/12 xl:w-6/12"><div class="relative"><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="600" height="361" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="w-full" style="color:transparent;object-position:50% 50%" src="https://assets.warhammer-community.com/thh_auxrules-jul03-strikefade-gutxijtdrn.jpg"/><div class="absolute inset-10 flex flex-col justify-end overflow-hidden opacity-0 invisible"><div class="relative overflow-y-scroll flex"><div class="wysiwyg overflow-y-scroll md-max:m-10 text-left p-10 pr-20 bg-white rounded-[10px] w-full"><p><strong>Cohort Doctrine: Reconnaissance Pattern Cohort </strong></p><p><strong>Cohort Tactica: Strike and Fade</strong></p><p><strong>Models with this Special Rule and the Cavalry Type can Control Objectives and move further as part of the Evade Reaction.</strong></p><p>Models with this Special Rule which also have the Cavalry Type may Hold, Control and Contest Objectives and increase their Initiative Characteristic to 5 while performing the  Evade Reaction.</p></div><button class="absolute top-20 right-20 md:top-10 md:right-10 p-[2px] rounded-full border" aria-label="Close"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewbox="0 0 10 10" class="w-10"><path stroke="currentColor" d="m1 1 8.5 8.5m0-8.5L1 9.5"></path></svg></button></div></div></div><button class="mt-10 copy-bitter-xs py-[2px] px-5 border border-grey-300 rounded-[3px] default-transition hover:bg-stormcastYellow">Read Text</button></div></div></div></div><div id=""><div class="column md:w-10/12 mx-auto xl:w-9/12"><p>This Liber contains rules to make your Solar Auxilia one of the Legiones Auxilia, a Cohort associated with one of the Legions. For example, the Therion Velites are the Legiones Auxilia of the Raven Guard Legion. In this case, this replaces the Form Ranks! Advanced Reaction with <strong>Displacement</strong>, allowing for new and interesting playstyles that evoke the character of the parent Legions themselves.</p><h3><strong><span class="font-bold">Standout units</span></strong></h3><p>While there are many great units to pick from, my favourite is still the humble<strong> Lasrifle Section</strong>, the cornerstone of every Solar Auxilia list. They pack a lot of firepower, especially when their lasrifles are upgraded with blast chargers and become a threat to a number of units. </p></div></div><div id=""><div class="article-fullWidthImage"><div class="xl:flex flex-col items-end xl-max:out-container xl:w-full mx-auto                 xl:column"><div class="w-full"><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="897" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="w-full" style="color:transparent;object-position:50% 50%" src="https://assets.warhammer-community.com/thh_auxrules-jul03-pic1wide-7mndxe4nfv.jpg"/></div></div><div class="column w-full"></div></div></div><div id=""><div class="column md:w-10/12 mx-auto xl:w-9/12"><p>Next up is the <strong>Charonite Ogryn Section</strong>.

It’s not the quickest, but it has sheer ruggedness. With Front Armour 14 and six Hull Points it can take a lot of firepower. Then you have the range of weapon options, such as the humble Battlecannon – which can improve to AP 3 via the Heavy (AP) special rule – and with Pinning (1), it is a great all round weapon. You can also opt for a Vanquisher Cannon if you want to specialise into an Anti-tank/dreadnought role…</p></div></div></div></div>
