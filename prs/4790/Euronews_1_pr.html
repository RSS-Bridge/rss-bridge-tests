                <p>Berlin's festive season has taken a spooky, retro twist: the Hawkins Christmas Market has opened on the Kurfürstendamm to coincide with the fifth season of <a href="https://www.euronews.com/tag/netflix">Netflix</a>'s cult hit Stranger Things.</p><p>With flickering lights, a nostalgic fairground feel and a <a href="https://www.euronews.com/culture/2022/06/22/the-whole-worlds-gone-mad-kate-bush-on-stranger-things-and-chart-revival-in-rare-interview">soundtrack straight out of the 80s</a>, visitors and fans can step right into the world of the series.</p><figure><img src="https://images.euronews.com/articles/stories/09/57/78/24/808x454_cmsv2_371e9ef1-e259-564d-9895-ef8dd3b51a9a-9577824.jpg"><figcaption>                                                                                                                                            The Hawkins Christmas Market in Berlin, 11 December 2025                                      Johanna Urbancik / Euronews                                                                                             </figcaption></figure><br><p>For a month, fans can wander through a recreation of Hawkins, perch on the Byers' sofa for a photo, cue up 80s tracks on a jukebox or try a Demogorgon-shaped waffle. Entry to the whole promo set-up is free - but you'll be paying with your time. </p><p>Since 4 December, the market has been opening daily at 3pm. Anyone thinking of popping by should expect queues: they snake along the street and continue once you’re inside. Staff reckon somewhere between 5,000 and 7,000 people visit the Hawkins Christmas Market each day.</p><p>If you want to be there for the opening, you’ll need to arrive a few hours early and be prepared to wait for one or two hours. And the queues don’t stop once you’re in - it's a good half-hour wait for most stalls and attractions. The good news: prices are pretty reasonable. If you fancy channelling Eleven, a small "Eggo" waffle will set you back €2.50 - or €3 with chocolate or maple syrup.</p><figure><img src="https://images.euronews.com/articles/stories/09/57/78/24/808x493_cmsv2_0bae34ee-9839-5724-b6e6-f79a1d21733c-9577824.jpg"><figcaption>                                                                                                                                            A Demogorgon waffle at the Stranger Things Christmas market, 11 December 2025                                      Laura Fleischmann / Euronews                                                                                             </figcaption></figure><br><p>The waffles, however, aren't quite what you'll remember from the show. They're shaped like the Demogorgon and they're pretty small - so if you’re properly hungry, you'll need a whole pack of them. Then again, fans will know that Eleven was never one to stop at just a single Eggo. </p><p>Drinks won't drain your wallet either. There's no alcohol on offer, but you can still pick up Stranger Things-themed options like the "Hawkins Punch" for three euros. That's actually cheaper than a mulled wine at most Berlin <a href="https://www.euronews.com/tag/christmas-market">Christmas markets</a>, where prices this year sit at around five to six euros.</p><figure><img src="https://images.euronews.com/articles/stories/09/57/78/24/808x454_cmsv2_ffd31751-1e99-50e5-91d5-aecb97dc1600-9577824.jpg"><figcaption>                                                                                                                                            The drinks menu at the Hawkins Christmas market in Berlin, 11 December 2025                                      Johanna Urbancik / Euronews                                                                                             </figcaption></figure><br><p>Food-wise, the waffles are a steal compared with a typical Christmas market. A bratwurst in a roll can easily cost five euros, making the waffles about half the price. The downside? The menu is very limited, with waffles pretty much the only option. </p><p>But the fun isn't just for your stomach. Visitors can immerse themselves in the world of their favourite characters. The POP Ku'Damm building houses an arcade with cult classics like Pac-Man, a chance to pose on the Byers family's iconic sofa, watch 80s TV shows, snap a selfie with a Demogorgon, and even step into the Upside Down on board a bus.</p><figure><img src="https://images.euronews.com/articles/stories/09/57/78/24/808x454_cmsv2_1c7c525c-b23d-520c-b9f8-53afc362b71e-9577824.jpg"><figcaption>                                                                                                                                            A Demogorgon at the Hawkins Christmas market in Berlin, 11 December 2025                                      Johanna Urbancik / Euronews                                                                                             </figcaption></figure><br><p>Fans in Berlin can spend almost a month exploring the Upside Down before the series wraps up with its final episode on 31 December 2025.</p><p>One of the show's characters who has won over fans' hearts is Steve Harrington, portraied by Joe Keery. Alongside acting, Keery releases music as "DJO".

He concluded: "The POV is really from me."</p><p>The Stranger Things Christmas market in Berlin is open at Ku'damm until 30 December 2025, daily from 3 pm to 10 pm.

                <p>Myanmar’s military acknowledged on Saturday that it had carried out an airstrike on a hospital in the western state of Rakhine, which a local rescuer and media reports said killed more than 30 people, including patients, medical workers and children.</p><p>In a statement published by the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper, the military’s information office said armed groups, including the ethnic Arakan Army (AA) and the People’s Defence Force, pro-democracy militias formed after the army takeover in 2021, used the hospital as their base.</p><p>It said the military carried out necessary security measures and launched a counter-terrorism operation against the hospital buildings on Wednesday. It added that those killed or injured were armed members of opposition groups and their supporters but not civilians.</p><p>A senior official for rescue services in Rakhine told the Associated Press on Thursday that 34 people, including patients and medical staff, were killed and about 80 others sustained injuries to varying degrees.</p><p>They noted that an army fighter jet dropped two bombs on the general hospital in Mrauk-U township, an area controlled by the AA. He said the hospital building was destroyed by the bombs on Wednesday night.</p><p>The United Nations on Thursday said in a statement that the attack was part of a broader pattern of strikes causing harm to civilians and civilian objects that are devastating communities across the country.</p><p>Head of the World Health Organisation (WHO) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a post on X that he was “appalled” by the attack on the hospital that provided primary healthcare, saying it will disrupt access to health care for entire communities that depend on it.</p><p>“Mrauk-U People’s Hospital is the primary health care centre in the area, providing health and emergency services, obstetric care, and surgical capacity. This attack will disrupt access to health care for entire communities,” said Ghebreyesus.</p><p>Ghebreyesus also noted that this is the 67th attack against a hospital, clinic or medical facility that the WHO’s Myanmar operations have been able to verify this year. He called for greater accountability and an immediate halt to attacks against hospitals.</p><p>“Every attack on health care is an attack on humanity. Health facilities, patients and health workers must be protected at all times. Stop attacks on health care!”</p><p>Mrauk-U, located 530 kilometres northwest of Yangon, the country’s largest city, was captured by the Arakan Army in February 2024.</p><p>The AA is the well-trained and well-armed military wing of the Rakhine ethnic minority movement, which seeks autonomy from Myanmar’s central government.</p><p>It began its offensive in Rakhine in November 2023, and has seized a strategically important regional army headquarters and 14 of Rakhine’s 17 townships.</p><p>The group vowed in its statement released on Thursday that it will pursue accountability in cooperation with global organisations to ensure justice and take “strong and decisive action” against the military.</p><p>The group also said in separate statements that the army had launched a series of overnight airstrikes in five towns in Rakhine since the hospital attack, killing at least eight civilians and wounding close to a dozen others.</p><p>Myanmar has been in turmoil since the army took power in 2021, triggering widespread popular opposition. Many opponents of military rule have since taken up arms, and large parts of the country are now embroiled in conflict.</p>

                <p>Democrat lawmakers in the US House of Representatives have released a selection of photos from the estate of disgraced financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, including some of US President Donald Trump, former President Bill Clinton and disgraced UK royal, the former Prince Andrew.</p><p>The dozens of photos initially released by Democratic lawmakers on the House Oversight Committee were a small part of more than 95,000 they received from the estate of Epstein, who died by suicide in a New York jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.</p><p>The photos released on Friday were separate from the case files that the Department of Justice is now under compulsion to release, but anticipation is growing as the Trump administration faces a deadline next week to produce the Epstein files that have been the source of conspiracy theories and speculation for years.</p><p>The photos were released without captions or context and included a black-and-white image of Trump alongside six women whose faces were blacked out.</p><figure><img src="https://images.euronews.com/articles/stories/09/58/18/23/808x641_cmsv2_f0edffdc-f22f-593a-be43-9468f231aab7-9581823.jpg"><figcaption>                                                                                                                                            This undated, redacted photo released by Democrats on the House Oversight Committee shows Donald Trump standing with a group of women                                      AP/AP                                                                                             </figcaption></figure><br><p>The president said he hadn’t seen the photos from Epstein’s estate released on Friday, but noted that they were “no big deal.” Trump said Epstein was “all over Palm Beach” and had “photos with everybody.”</p><p>Representative Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, did not say whether any of the women in the photos was a victim of abuse, but he added, “Our commitment from day one has been to redact any photo, any information that could lead to any sort of harm to any of the victims.”</p><p>White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson accused Democrats of “selectively releasing cherry-picked photos with random redactions to try and create a false narrative" and called it part of a “Democrat hoax against President Trump.”</p><figure><img src="https://images.euronews.com/articles/stories/09/58/18/23/808x1063_cmsv2_9a8fda91-f2a5-5fd5-a9cc-fc90716bd5c5-9581823.jpg"><figcaption>                                                                                                                                            This undated, redacted photo released by Democrats on the House Oversight Committee shows Donald Trump                                      AP Photo                                                                                             </figcaption></figure><br><p>Many of the photos have already circulated in the public.

                <p>US President Donald Trump says that the leaders of Thailand and Cambodia have agreed to renew a truce after days of deadly clashes, even as Thai and Cambodian officials suggested that there is still work to be done to get the ceasefire the US brokered in late October back on track.</p><p>Trump announced the agreement to restart the ceasefire in a post on his own social media platform, Truth Social, following phone calls with Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul and Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet.</p><p>“I had a very good conversation this morning with the Prime Minister of Thailand, Anutin Charnvirakul, and the Prime Minister of Cambodia, Hun Manet, concerning the very unfortunate reawakening of their long-running War,” wrote Trump.</p><p>“They have agreed to CEASE all shooting effective this evening, and go back to the original Peace Accord made with me, and them, with the help of the Great Prime Minister of Malaysia, Anwar Ibrahim.”</p><p>The Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday disputed Trump’s assertion that a ceasefire was agreed to without providing any details, and Thai defence ministry spokesperson Surasant Kongsiri said clashes were still ongoing.</p><p>Cambodia’s defence ministry reported that Thailand continued to carry out strikes early Saturday. Those strikes could not be independently verified.</p><p>Trump claimed that fighting had restarted after an unfortunate accident involving a Cambodian roadside bomb which detonated, killing several Thai soldiers stationed around the border areas, triggering a strong response from Bangkok.</p><p>“The roadside bomb that originally killed and wounded numerous Thai Soldiers was an accident, but Thailand nevertheless retaliated very strongly,” noted Trump.</p><p>Thailand however offered a contrasting view, stressing that the initial bomb which reignited the fighting this week, reviving a decades-old border dispute, was not an accident and rejecting any suggestion that it was anything but a deliberate hostile act.</p><p>“It’s definitely not a roadside accident," Anutin said on Saturday morning on his Facebook account. "Thailand will continue to perform military actions until we feel no more harm and threats to our land and people. I want to make it clear. Our actions this morning already spoke.”</p><p>After speaking with Trump on Friday but before the US president's social media posting, Anutin said he reiterated to Trump that Thailand’s position was to keep fighting until Cambodia no longer posed a threat to its sovereignty.</p><figure><img src="https://images.euronews.com/articles/stories/09/58/17/99/808x539_cmsv2_7187dff8-20c5-5407-8eae-4cd30335cf4e-9581799.jpg"><figcaption>                                                                                                                                            President Donald Trump speaks to guests in the Grand Foyer of the White House during the Congressional Ball, Thursday, Dec. 11, 2025, in Washington                                      Alex Brandon/Copyright 2025 The AP.

Don’t just say that we have to stop fighting," Anutin said. "You should announce to the world that Cambodia will stop firing, will withdraw their forces, will clear all land mines. Please show us the actions.”</p><p>Trump however stressed that the renewed truce is in place, signalling that both countries will respect it and suggesting that trade with the US may have been leveraged into restoring peace between the two warring nations.</p><p>“Both Countries are ready for PEACE and continued Trade with the United States of America. It is my Honor to work with Anutin and Hun in resolving what could have evolved into a major War between two otherwise wonderful and prosperous Countries!”</p><p> The US president also added that Malaysia’s Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim played an instrumental role in facilitating the renewal of the ceasefire.</p>

                <p>On two major Kazakh stages — in the capital Astana and in Almaty — the IV Freedom Festival unites some of the most prominent names from the world of ballet. </p><p>Star performers from the Berlin State Ballet and the American Ballet Theatre joined forces with Astana Opera and the Berlin Ballet Company to present a two-act program: a classical staging of <em>Paquita</em> followed by a series of contemporary works. Tickets for the festival quickly sold out, a clear sign of the growing demand for world-class ballet in Kazakhstan.</p><h2><strong>Act I: Classical <em>Paquita</em></strong></h2><p>The first evening opened with <em>Paquita</em>, staged by Altynai Asylmuratova — People’s Artist of Russia, former prima ballerina of the Mariinsky Theatre, the Royal Ballet, the Marseille National Ballet and currently the Artistic Director of Astana Opera.</p><p>“She’s exquisite — one of my favorite ballerinas to watch,” said Chloe Misseldine, Principal Dancer of the American Ballet Theatre, who performed the title role.</p><figure><img src="https://images.euronews.com/articles/stories/09/56/32/82/1280x853_cmsv2_13fb48cb-b22a-5ef0-86c1-794ad72236bc-9563282.jpg"><figcaption>                                                                                                                                            Chloe Misseldine performing "Paquita" at the IV Freedom Festival                                      Copyright: The Freedom Festival                                                                                             </figcaption></figure><br><p>The international cast arrived in Kazakhstan only a week before the festival and had to travel from Astana to Almaty, leaving little time for rehearsals. For Misseldine, however, the compressed schedule was not a challenge: she had danced this timeless masterpiece two years earlier and immediately felt at home in the role again.</p><p>At the press conference, Martin ten Kortenaar — Principal Dancer of the Berlin State Ballet, performing Lucien d'Hervilly — noted that despite the tight schedule, rehearsals were smooth and focused.</p><figure><img src="https://images.euronews.com/articles/stories/09/56/32/82/1280x853_cmsv2_7c70d307-448d-5606-8d09-95ad48cdc030-9563282.jpg"><figcaption>                                                                                                                                            Martin ten Kortenaar performing "Paquita" at the IV Freedom Festival                                      Copyright: The Freedom Festival                                                                                             </figcaption></figure><br><p>Both he and Misseldine are accustomed to international collaborations, which they see as vital to their artistic development. “It’s always nice as a dancer to be able to travel and work with other dancers,” he said. “For me, it opens my eyes to the rest of the ballet world.”</p><p>The performance itself was a model of academic precision: the leading roles were delivered with both technical clarity and artistic grace, the corps de ballet was polished and confident, and the audience responded with enthusiastic applause and shouts of “Bravo!”</p><h2><strong>Act II: Contemporary Program — CHOREO X</strong></h2><p>The second act transitioned into contemporary territory, where the Berlin Ballet Company — joined by guest artists Chloe Misseldine and Martin ten Kortenaar — performed works that were sensual, vulnerable, passionate, and boldly expressive. Each piece conveyed its own emotional language, yet together they formed a cohesive and compelling narrative. In contrast to the classical tradition showcased in Act I, Act II explored the current landscape of ballet and pointed toward its future.</p><p>Arshak Ghalumyan, director of the ensemble, emphasized the importance of these artistic exchanges: “Creating cultural bridges is invaluable — for Kazakhstan, for international companies, for everyone.

                <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang was named as the Financial Times’ 2025 Person of the Year, continuing the trend of naming artificial intelligence (AI) executives as the year’s most influential people.</p><p>The FT said it gave Huang the title because of the role he has played in “the AI mania that is sweeping through the business and financial worlds.”</p><p>This year, Huang led California-based computer chipmaker Nvidia on an unstoppable ascent to become the most valuable public company in the world, and the first to break through the $4 trillion (€3.4 trillion) barrier.</p><p>Its ultra-powerful AI computer chips are the hottest commodity in the race for global AI dominance, underpinning one of the biggest-ever pushes to build new tech infrastructure across the globe.</p><p>The FT’s announcement comes the day after <a href="https://www.euronews.com/culture/2025/12/11/time-person-of-the-year-2025-announced-the-architects-of-ai"><strong>TIME magazine named</strong></a>the “Architects of AI” as their Person of the Year, including executives from major AI companies, including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, xAI CEO Elon Musk, and Huang.</p><h2>Who is Jensen Huang?</h2><p>Born in Taiwan, Huang moved to the United States with his family as a boy and eventually settled in California after attending Stanford University.</p><p>At 30, he was working as an electrical engineer in the San Francisco Bay Area when he co-founded Nvidia with two friends. Their goal was to develop a graphics processing unit (GPU) that would revolutionise computer graphics for video games.</p><p>Huang weathered many storms with Nvidia, holding the course and making some smart, if risky bets early on. </p><p>He believed that traditional chip designs would eventually fail to keep up with the growing demands of microprocessors and that Nvidia’s gaming chips would give them an edge in this new era.</p><p>The gamble paid off, as Nvidia’s chips are now the leading hardware used to train powerful AI systems, like the technology behind ChatGPT and image generators. Companies including Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI use Nvidia’s computer chips in their AI models.</p><p>Huang called Nvidia “one of the most consequential technology companies in history.” </p><p>“The computer technique that took us 30 years to invent is now fundamentally changing all of computing,” he added.</p>

                <p>Polar bears are rapidly undergoing “fundamental genetic changes” in a desperate attempt to adapt to the climate crisis.</p><p>Human-caused climate change is warming the <a href="https://www.euronews.com/green/2025/11/25/bringing-people-back-europes-arctic-communities-fight-to-stay-alive"><strong>Arctic</strong></a> at an accelerated rate, two to four times the global average. This significantly reduces vital platforms of sea ice that polar bears use to hunt seals, resulting in severe food scarcity and isolation. </p><p>As a result, more than two-thirds of polar bears are predicted to become extinct by 2050, with researchers warning of "total extinction” by the end of this century.</p><p>However, scientists at the University of East Anglia (UEA) have found that polar bear DNA is playing a “key role” in helping populations adapt to changing climates and diets.</p><h2>How polar bears are changing their DNA</h2><p>The study, published in the journal <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13100-025-00387-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>Springer Nature</strong></a><strong>,</strong> analysed blood samples from 17 polar bears in northeastern and southeastern Greenland to compare the activity of ‘jumping genes’, their relationship with temperature in the two regions, and changes in gene expression.</p><p>Jumping genes are small pieces of the genome that can influence how other genes work.</p><p>Researchers found that rising temperatures appeared to have caused a “dramatic increase” in the activity of jumping genes within bears in southeastern <a href="https://www.euronews.com/green/2025/10/16/climate-change-in-the-arctic-how-melting-ice-is-causing-greenland-to-shrink"><strong>Greenland</strong></a>, where temperatures are significantly warmer than in the north. </p><p>They argue that these changes in DNA, which can impact a bear’s metabolism and how it deals with heat stress, may signal a “desperate survival mechanism against melting sea ice”.</p><p>Changes were also found in gene expression areas of DNA linked to fat processing, which is important when food is scarce. </p><p>The study argues this could mean that the southeastern bears are slowly adapting to the rougher plant-based diets that can be found in the warmer regions, compared to the mainly fatty, seal-based diets of the northern population.</p><h2>Are polar bears still at risk of extinction?</h2><p>Lead researcher Dr Alice Godden says the findings provide a “genetic blueprint” for how polar bears might be able to adapt quickly to climate change, arguing they should shape the focus of future conservation efforts.</p><p>“However, we cannot be complacent,” Dr Godden adds. “This offers some hope, but does not mean that polar bears are at any less risk of extinction.</p><p>“We still need to be doing everything we can to reduce <a href="https://www.euronews.com/green/2025/11/13/world-has-virtually-exhausted-its-carbon-budget-as-fossil-fuel-emissions-reach-all-time-hi"><strong>global carbon emissions</strong></a>and slow temperature increases.”</p><p>The study concludes that the next step would be to look at other polar bear populations to analyse the genomes of the species “before it’s too late”.</p>

                <p>Gonorrhoea, a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) that often doesn't come with symptoms, has become harder to treat as bacteria develop resistance to existing antibiotics. If left untreated, it can cause serious problems such as pelvic inflammatory disease or infertility.</p><p>Zoliflodacin, the first new antibiotic developed exclusively for the treatment of this infection in decades, aims to fight drug-resistant superbugs and it is expected to receive marketing approval in the United States. </p><p>Researchers recently conducted a clinical trial involving more than 900 people from the US, South Africa, Thailand, Belgium, and the Netherlands – the largest evaluation to date in participants with N. gonorrhoeae infection.</p><p>The trial findings, published on Friday in The Lancet medical journal, saw that the new treatment – a single pill – cured over 90 per cent of infections at genital sites.</p><p>Researchers said that the new medication was well-tolerated among the participants, with side effects similar to those seen with current treatments, and no serious safety issues were reported. </p><p>“Gonorrhoea continues to be a significant public health concern worldwide, and the growing challenge of antimicrobial resistance only heightens the urgency for new treatment options,” said Edward Hook, professor of medicine at the University of Alabama and lead of the study. </p><p>He added that the decades-long absence of new gonorrhoea treatments, together with rising antibiotic resistance, has created significant challenges in managing this STI.</p><p>In 2023, there were around 100,000 confirmed gonorrhoea cases in the European Union, equivalent to 25 cases for every 100,000 people – a 31 per cent increase from the previous year. </p><h2>Rising antibiotic resistance</h2><p>The current main treatment is ceftriaxone, as the infection has grown resistant to every other known antibiotic that could fight it.</p><p>According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), resistance to ceftriaxone remains uncommon in the EU. However, resistance to azithromycin – often given together with ceftriaxone – has risen in recent years, with 25.6 per cent of bacteria samples showing resistance in 2022.</p><p>The new treatment was developed through a public–private partnership led by Innoviva Speciality Therapeutics and the non-profit Global Antibiotic Research &amp; Development Partnership (GARDP).</p><p>The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is expected to give approval for Zoliflodacin in the coming days. </p><p>In the EU, it is still an investigational drug, used only in clinical trials or under national early‑access frameworks, not as a routinely prescribed antibiotic.</p>
