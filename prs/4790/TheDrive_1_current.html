                <img src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/4251212eng_link01-copy.jpg?quality=85"> <p class="article-paragraph skip">Back in June, <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/honda-has-a-new-plan-to-support-its-aging-classics-like-the-nsx">Honda announced an initiative</a> to support owners of its most beloved models, starting with the original NSX. On Friday, it detailed more information about this new business, which now has a name: <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/category/honda-news">Honda</a> Heritage Works.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Heritage Works will be composed of two arms: <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/category/honda-news">Honda</a> Heritage Parts, and Honda Restoration Service. The names are relatively self-explanatory, but Honda has been thoughtful about its mission here, and the specific kinds of products and projects it&#8217;s taking on. Heritage Parts will offer two kinds of items: Genuine Honda Heritage Compatible Parts and Genuine Honda Heritage Reproduction Parts.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">The former are, in the company&#8217;s words, &#8220;newly redeveloped and reproduced to replace original parts no longer available for sale by Honda.&#8221; They may sound like the lesser of the two categories, but what&#8217;s important to note here is that <em>compatible </em>parts will benefit from &#8220;technological advancements, and adoption of new materials and manufacturing methods.&#8221; So, imagine a part on the S2000 that was flawed or underbaked from the factory, that the aftermarket has improved upon. Honda will take that into consideration when forming these new and improved components.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">The other category, Genuine Reproduction Parts, is more straightforward. They&#8217;ll be &#8220;reproduced using the same materials and production methods that were used for the original parts,&#8221; in Honda&#8217;s words. And, while we&#8217;re unfortunately used to getting the shaft on this side of the world when Japanese automakers start spinning up parts production for classics, Honda isn&#8217;t going to leave us out. The press release clearly states that Heritage parts will be &#8220;available globally for purchase through the same distribution channels as other standard Honda genuine parts in each country.&#8221; Phew.</p>    <figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1229" height="819" loading="lazy" data-id="6581028" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/vision_scroll_img_01-copy.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6581028" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1229" height="819" loading="lazy" data-id="6581030" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/vision_scroll_img_03-copy.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6581030" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1229" height="819" loading="lazy" data-id="6581029" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/vision_scroll_img_02-copy.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6581029" /></figure> <figcaption class="blocks-gallery-caption wp-element-caption">Enjoy these images of Honda building NSXs way back when. <em>Honda</em></figcaption></figure>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Then we have the restoration side of the operation, which is where things get very exciting indeed. Honda has actually already been at work on this, with its NSX Refresh Plan. Going forward, as the company takes on more models, it&#8217;ll be known as Honda Restoration Service, and it&#8217;ll continue to be carried out at its Takanezawa facility in Tochigi, Japan.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">There will be two items on the menu for lucky clients. Basic restorations will encompass &#8220;frequently requested works on performance-related items such as the engine and suspensions,&#8221; while total restorations will extend to &#8220;exterior and interior works as well as more detailed, comprehensive works tailored to the condition of each vehicle.&#8221; For exterior rehab, Honda will disassemble the vehicle to body-in-white status, and repaint; for interior work, it&#8217;ll reupholster seats, and retrim the dashboard, door panels, and controls.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Provided you can get your vehicle to Japan, Honda will start taking applications from NSX owners for the year ahead in January. No other models have been mentioned yet, nor pricing, though the folks able to employ the <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/meeting-the-guardians-of-hondas-first-winning-f1-car">&#8220;guardians&#8221;</a> of the NSX probably don&#8217;t care about that.

Apple not only released Brad Pitt’s <em>F1: The Movie</em> but also bought the sport’s media rights for $140 million per year. <em>Drive to Survive</em>’s seventh Netflix season, a series of governing body scandals, and Christian Horner&#8217;s (and Helmut Marko&#8217;s) departure from Red Bull kept spectators satisfied with a plethora of drama, and a looming 11th team only ensured more was on its way. </p>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1920" height="1280" loading="lazy" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2250515185.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85&#038;w=1920" alt="ABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DECEMBER 07: Max Verstappen of the Netherlands driving the (1) Oracle Red Bull Racing RB21 leads Lando Norris of Great Britain driving the (4) McLaren MCL39 Mercedes Oscar Piastri of Australia driving the (81) McLaren MCL39 Mercedes and the rest of the field at the start during the F1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi at Yas Marina Circuit on December 07, 2025 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.

Hope that the real entertainment doesn’t come in the form of caviar bumps on Miami yacht decks parked atop plastic vinyl posing as seawater, or Elvis impersonators roaming the Las Vegas Strip paddock. </p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Hope that the real entertainment still lies on track—even if a championship win from third place tastes bittersweet. </p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">As more fans flocked to the sport this year, F1 seemed to be everywhere and inescapable: from beauty advertisements to social media campaigns to Vogue magazine spreads. I heard from several fans—both from the V12 era and the <em>DTS</em> generation—that they were experiencing F1 exhaustion as the sport’s pursuit of new spectators and revenue streams meant it reared its head around every corner. </p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">I, for one, decided to hit the brakes on my race reporting for a number of reasons, but something I’m calling “Formula Fatigue” was one of them. Even the drivers, the very people central to the sport’s sustained success, expressed frustration with a shift toward Hollywood as Max Verstappen chose to forgo the driver-exclusive screening of “F1” and continued to criticize F1’s anniversary additions.</p>    <figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-2 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1920" height="1280" loading="lazy" data-id="6580973" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2223383188.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="TOWCESTER, UNITED KINGDOM - 2025/07/06: Nico Hulkenberg of Stake F1 Team Kick Sauber celebrates on the podium during the Formula One British Grand Prix at Silverstone.

But in the year 2025, he became something far from synonymous with his name: an underdog.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Suddenly, the driver who seemed to outwardly despise F1’s American show business venture became the provider of entertainment. As the season finale neared, McLaren team principal Zac Brown even likened Verstappen to a horror film villain who refused to be beaten.</p>    <figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-1 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-3 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1920" height="1271" loading="lazy" data-id="6580975" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2249926225.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="ABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DECEMBER 04: Lando Norris of Great Britain and McLaren and Oscar Piastri of Australia and McLaren talk in the Drivers Press Conference during previews ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi at Yas Marina Circuit on December 04, 2025 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.

It’s easy to look back at Norris winning the first race of the season and build a narrative of a dominant car, but it took him seven races after the Australian Grand Prix to stand on the top podium step for a second time. </p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">If Verstappen’s underdog story was turning a 104-point deficit into two points in just nine races, Piastri’s was playing the team game. And Norris, even when leading the championship, exemplified an underdog story of being everything athletes are told not to be: candid and vulnerable, sometimes to a fault.</p>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1920" height="1280" loading="lazy" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2250501019.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85&#038;w=1920" alt="ABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES - DECEMBER 07: The 2025 F1 drivers photo call prior to the F1 Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi at Yas Marina Circuit on December 07, 2025 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.

Sure, a lot of them are built like crap and can&#8217;t withstand more than two years of use, but there are some truly great ones out there. This rig—called an Xcursion by Xplorer—is based on a hard-working 2003 Ford F-350 with all the right components (<a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/i-cant-believe-somebody-swapped-a-6-0l-power-stroke-into-a-first-gen-ram">so long as you can put up with a 6.0-liter Power Stroke</a>). It&#8217;s a 4&#215;4 dually with a six-speed manual transmission, and it&#8217;s for sale right now.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">I stumbled upon <a href="https://smalltruckcampers.loma.tech/listing/4x4-diesel-manual-rv-xplorer-xcu-1637669?mcp_token=eyJwaWQiOjQ5NDU1OCwic2lkIjo5ODUwMjU0MzQsImF4IjoiN2RlNTNlMDQwYWVhNzM2MDcyYTIxM2Y5OGVkMzZiZmEiLCJ0cyI6MTc2NTIyNzA2MCwiZXhwIjoxNzY3NjQ2MjYwfQ.PzDnUSG5Ouz6umR1fgyhbHFC-JGM7U-BpajOBbokoXI" rel="nofollow">the listing</a> while scrolling through Instagram—usually a fruitless endeavor, but this time around, it wasn&#8217;t a total waste thanks to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/smalltruckcampers/" rel="nofollow">the Small Truck Campers page</a>. The Xcursion is located in Rancho Viejo, Texas, and the seller has it priced at $69,000. You might think that&#8217;s a bit steep, but look at what you&#8217;re getting here.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">People either love or hate the 6.0-liter Power Stroke diesel; if you&#8217;re in the latter camp, this one won&#8217;t be for you. If you&#8217;re about it, though, this one is a gem. Not only is it paired with the ZF6 manual transmission, itself a much more desirable option than the 5R110 automatic, but it also has a Gear Vendors over/underdrive. That means the transmission has 12 forward speeds, and then, there&#8217;s the two-speed transfer case. Manual lockout hubs really pull it all together as a magical drivetrain combo.</p>    <figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-4 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1032" height="774" loading="lazy" data-id="6578112" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/95c56f17-83af-4e52-9ff6-233b2f15.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="2003 Xplorer Xcursion" class="wp-image-6578112" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1032" height="774" loading="lazy" data-id="6578113" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/0117a7b5-a7bb-4c07-9470-17ed4a2d.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="2003 Xplorer Xcursion" class="wp-image-6578113" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1032" height="774" loading="lazy" data-id="6578110" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/d4b09e91-ede2-44ff-91e3-a25feb4c.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="2003 Xplorer Xcursion" class="wp-image-6578110" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1032" height="774" loading="lazy" data-id="6578111" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/efbfb576-018f-474e-be08-e6ee8d5c.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="2003 Xplorer Xcursion" class="wp-image-6578111" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1032" height="492" loading="lazy" data-id="6578109" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/8bab81bc-1045-4e8a-9ca5-ab7ea96f.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="2003 Xplorer Xcursion" class="wp-image-6578109" /></figure> <figcaption class="blocks-gallery-caption wp-element-caption">The seller moved to Nicaragua and is looking to part with this sweet machine.

Even better, it was owned by a Ford service manager for most of its life. Not too shabby.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">You could hop behind the wheel of this sucker and sleep in it any night of the year thanks to the well-insulated fiberglass shell and Onan diesel generator. And with 33-inch Cooper tires all around, you should be in good shape, even when the going gets muddy.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">I don&#8217;t have any skin in the game, so I don&#8217;t care if you buy this or not. But I think it&#8217;s at least worth ogling over, as you rarely see a diesel RV with a stick-shift anymore. Add in the Gear Vendors upgrade and the 4&#215;4 with manual locking hubs, and you just might have a winner. It&#8217;ll definitely stand out amongst the 101 Class C Airstreams during your next KOA stay.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip"><em>Got a tip or question for the author?

However, the FX trim is the ideal choice for someone looking to get inexpensive wheels while still having something they can take some pride in. It&#8217;s pretty bare-bones, but it comes with a cute body kit and conservative lowering springs to give it a sharp look. While it doesn&#8217;t reward spirited driving or present a stirring experience, it&#8217;s got plenty going for it as an inexpensive get-around car.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">The Corolla FX could also be described as a base model with the slightest spritz of sporting pretenses. It&#8217;s got a humble 169 horsepower and a groaning CVT, which gives it about as much gusto as Squidward at the start of his shift at the Krusty Krab. But it rides pretty well, and just as importantly, it&#8217;s fun to look at as you walk away after parking.</p>    <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-basics">The Basics</h2>    <figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-5 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1920" height="1078" loading="lazy" data-id="6580438" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Corolla-int-deet-IMG_0360.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="2025 Toyota Corolla FX compact sedan." class="wp-image-6580438" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1920" height="1078" loading="lazy" data-id="6580439" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Corolla-ext-deet-IMG_0334.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="2025 Toyota Corolla FX compact sedan." class="wp-image-6580439" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1920" height="1078" loading="lazy" data-id="6580440" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Corolla-ext-deet-IMG_0340.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="2025 Toyota Corolla FX compact sedan." class="wp-image-6580440" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1920" height="1078" loading="lazy" data-id="6580442" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Corolla-ext-mainIMG_0344.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="2025 Toyota Corolla FX compact sedan." class="wp-image-6580442" /></figure> <figcaption class="blocks-gallery-caption wp-element-caption">The wheels and little wing look good, as do the front and rear splitters and exhaust tips. <em>Andrew P. Collins</em></figcaption></figure>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">The current-gen Corolla (12th-gen) has been a common sight on American roads for quite some time now—the compact car is largely unchanged since it was released here in 2020. While Toyota does squeeze serious performance out of the TGNA-C platform in this car (the all-wheel-drive manual-shift GR Corolla), the FX here is pretty much at the bottom of the lineup.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Inside, it feels like the quintessential economy car: small, a cloth interior, minimal features, and an excruciatingly soulless powertrain. The Corolla FX sedan weighs about 3,100 pounds, powered by a 2.0-liter, four-cylinder engine powering the front wheels, and a continuously variable transmission. There&#8217;s room for four adults; five is a little tight, but the trunk is generous.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Toyota says the name is a nod to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz7FmmHLcWg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Corolla FX16</a>—a hot-hatch variant from 1987. </p>     <figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">  </div></figure>    <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-driving-the-2025-corolla-fx">Driving the 2025 Corolla FX</h2>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">The Corolla&#8217;s seats are OK, not impressive, not bad, and I&#8217;d give about the same assessment to most of the cockpit&#8217;s looks and layout. Material choices feel reasonably robust, and a small contribution of orange piping goes a long way toward making the interior look and feel better. A big, plastic tombstone protrudes from the middle of the dashboard to hold a screen for smartphone connectivity and infotainment, which I absolutely hated.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Getting underway is an anodyne experience, no matter how hard you press the gas pedal. When I accelerated normally, I was satisfied. I didn&#8217;t feel like there was any trouble getting to socially acceptable town and highway speeds. But when I floored it, the sensation of acceleration was somehow exactly the same. Except when I was running at wide-open throttle, the Corolla&#8217;s CVT sustains an off-putting meowing sound.</p>    <div class="wp-block-jetpack-slideshow aligncenter" data-effect="slide"

the electric power steering, and I will say the car rides very well. Lowered cars tend to be stiff and harsh; the Corolla FX isn&#8217;t. And while it isn&#8217;t a fiercely responsive corner-carver either, it does feel very well-balanced, smooth, and consistent, even when you push it around a little.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Toyota did a nice job setting up the ride and steering feel on the Corolla FX to have some appreciable responsiveness while remaining heavily comfort-biased. At city speeds, where it&#8217;s meant to live, it feels confident.</p>    <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-highs-and-lows">The Highs and Lows</h2>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Look, it&#8217;s not that CVTs are inherently terrible, but driving the Corolla FX reminded me why so many car enthusiasts hate them. It simply diminishes the engine&#8217;s responsiveness so dramatically. And if you&#8217;re attuned to mechanical noises, listening to the Corolla&#8217;s powertrain is about as disheartening as a third-grade recorder recital.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">All that said, I know plenty of people who have no clue what their engine sounds like, and if that&#8217;s you, you&#8217;d have no problem driving this thing at all. In fact, you&#8217;d like it, because, like I just said above, ride quality is a standout feature of the Corolla FX.</p>    <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2025-corolla-fx-features-options-and-competition">2025 Corolla FX Features, Options, and Competition</h2>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">The Corolla FX has a cloth interior and a few luxury appointments—most of the optional buttons are blank. The 2.0-liter engine has Toyota&#8217;s VVT-i variable timing, which helps you hit better fuel economy numbers while giving you some oomph at high revs.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Since the sport suspension and body kit are part of the FX trim, the only options my test car had were a $530 convienece package (includes blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert, totally worth it), a $500 black roof option (most cars on dealer lots will probably have this to get a few more bucks out of buyers), and carpeted floor mats for $300.</p>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1920" height="1078" loading="lazy" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Corolla-ext-mainIMG_0343.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="2025 Toyota Corolla FX compact sedan." class="wp-image-6580474" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Andrew P. Collins</em> </figcaption></figure>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">The whole thing comes to just under $30,000, even with delivery, processing, and handling fees. At that price point, if you&#8217;ve got to have a new car, you could also be looking at Hyundai. Honda, Nissan, VW, and Kia. You can get a Hyundai Sonata SEL for around $30,000, which has a little more power but slightly worse fuel economy. The Honda Civic Sport has a nicer interior but even less power. A Nissan Sentra SR is less expensive but not as good-looking. A Jetta Sport is also less expensive than a Corolla FX, and it has tiptronic shiftability, which can be fun to play with. Finally, the Kia K4 GT Line Turbo has a peppier engine, but its design won&#8217;t appeal to everyone.</p>    <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fuel-economy-and-efficiency">Fuel Economy and Efficiency</h2>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">The Corolla FX claims 31, 39, and 34 mpg in city, highway, and combined driving conditions, respectively. That doesn&#8217;t seem very impressive to me, considering how slow and small the thing feels—economy cars were hitting those numbers decades ago. Then again, I suppose this car is heavier and safer.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">I mostly saw figures in the high 30s on my test loops—lots of 55-mph inter-county roads. Even beating on the car a few times to see what&#8217;d happen didn&#8217;t seem to ruin my overall average fuel economy all that much.</p>    <figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-6 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1920" height="1078" loading="lazy" data-id="6580476" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Corolla-ext-mainIMG_0339.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="2025 Toyota Corolla FX compact sedan." class="wp-image-6580476" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1920" height="1078" loading="lazy" data-id="6580477" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Corolla-ext-mainIMG_0342.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="2025 Toyota Corolla FX compact sedan." class="wp-image-6580477" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1920" height="1078" loading="lazy" data-id="6580475" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Corolla-ext-mainIMG_0376.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="2025 Toyota Corolla FX compact sedan." class="wp-image-6580475" /></figure> <figcaption class="blocks-gallery-caption wp-element-caption"><em>Andrew P. Collins</em></figcaption></figure>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Ultimately, I expect this will be an inexpensive car to run in terms of fuel, consumables, and upkeep. Toyota still has a good reputation for reliability, despite recent truck engine issues. The current Corolla is now a proven platform, and the FX model proves to be an inexpensive, good-looking car.</p>    <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-value-and-verdict">Value and Verdict</h2>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Nobody would accuse a low-spec Toyota of being an entry-level luxury car, but the brand does command a bit of a premium in the market over similar rivals. Based on price alone, the equivalent Kia K4 and Nissan Sentra have much newer-looking interiors, and I suspect the VW Jetta might have a more satisfying driving experience. In other words, the Corolla FX&#8217;s best quality is its sharp looks and overall value.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">The Corolla FX will get you plus friends, family, and pets around (though not all at once) in relative comfort and genuine style.  If it&#8217;s as reliable as the Corollas of the past, it should be a willing travel companion for decades with basic regular servicing.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">There&#8217;s a lot to be said for driving a car built on a prolific and successful platform from a brand that was once basically synonymous with low-cost compact commuter vehicles. And I really do love the look of this thing&#8230; don&#8217;t you?</p>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1920" height="1078" loading="lazy" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Corolla-ext-mainIMG_0345.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="2025 Toyota Corolla FX compact sedan." class="wp-image-6580478" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Andrew P.

If a Lexus V8 wailed it would be like this, smooth, almost subdued, but just the mildest bit uncorked. </p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">The best descriptor I’ve come to so far is Toyota’s delivered a smooth gentleman’s battle cry under full tilt.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Anyone longing for the Yamaha-tuned wail of the LFA’s V10 is going to be underwhelmed. This GR doesn’t scream like that.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">The basics: The 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8 has a hot V setup with an undisclosed (for now) amount of boost huffing out a preliminary estimate of 641 horsepower and 627 pound-feet of torque.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Though, the engine isn’t doing all the work here. An electric motor sandwiched between the carbon fiber driveshaft and transaxle in-house design, engineered, and built 8-speed automatic transmission does add torque fill and power in that mix, though how much is unknown at this point.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Of course, the cars we saw, touched, and revved were hand-built early prototypes and merely representative of production cars. But production is about a year away and development is not complete yet. It’s unclear if the final cars will even sound exactly like this.

Having nothing better to do, I slid it over for a browse. Something quickly caught my eye: it had two categories for 4x4s, one for two-door and one for four-door models. I found that precision a bit odd. When the clerk came back a few moments later, I asked what they typically had available in those categories. </p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">&#8220;Oh,&#8221; he said, chuckling, &#8220;they&#8217;re both just Wranglers. We&#8217;ve been getting a lot.&#8221;</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">I filed it away. The plural of anecdote is not data, after all. But it also had the whiff of truth about it. It may seem like only yesterday that we were seeing story after story about how the Wrangler had become so mainstream that it was threatening the sales dominance of the Toyota Camry, but Jeep left that high water mark behind years ago. Its once-<a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/jeep-wrangler-still-outsells-ford-bronco-almost-2-to-1">healthy lead</a> over its chief rival, the Ford Bronco, is in jeopardy for the first time since the latter was resurrected just a few years ago. </p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Desperate times call for desperate measures. According to <em>Reuters</em>, that little tidbit I learned on vacation was not only accurate, but applicable beyond just Jeep and the Wrangler. A source told the wire service that CEO Antonio Filosa gave the company&#8217;s American brands the green light to reclaim lost market share by any means necessary—including more fleet sales. </p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">So, no, you&#8217;re not crazy: that conspicuously large population of Jeep Wranglers (or Chrysler Pacificas, or Jeep Compasses, or <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/dodge-flip-flops-on-all-v8-durango-revives-v6-for-2026">Dodge Durangos</a>) you&#8217;ve spotted in close proximity to your frequent travel destination was not just a figment of your imagination. They&#8217;re really out there. </p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">As Reuters pointed out, there are advantages to fleet sales. While they may result in less profit per unit sold, they present an opportunity for positive exposure to the public without a corresponding advertising budget. Having recently queued up to enter Universal Studios Florida, I can say only one thing: I&#8217;ve never seen so many white Chrysler minivans (mostly Voyagers, but some Pacificas) in one place. If it&#8217;s a numbers game, then Stellantis is playing it correctly.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Will it be enough to keep the Wrangler ahead of the Bronco at the end of the month? We&#8217;ll just have to wait and see. </p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip"><em>Got a news tip?

                <img src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Rivian-Assistant-1.png?quality=85"> <p class="article-paragraph skip">Startup automaker <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/category/rivian-news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rivian</a> is fully committed that Apple CarPlay is not the future. The executive team is so resolute on this matter that a native home-brewed solution has been developed to give consumers capabilities they&#8217;ve been requesting.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">At the automaker&#8217;s Autonomy and AI day in Palo Alto, California on Thursday, Rivian unveiled Rivian Assistant, which is the automaker&#8217;s solution to bringing text messaging capabilities, and so much more, to its vehicles natively. The feature is set to launch in a phased rollout early in 2026 for both the first- and <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/car-reviews/2025-rivian-r1s-first-drive-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">second-generation R1</a> and will be on the R2 when it launches in 2026.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Rivian Assistant is a voice-activated system that can control the entire vehicle with full integration of AI, though Rivian hasn&#8217;t said which AI system is doing the lifting on the back end. This new feature will enable the text messaging capabilities, but takes things far beyond just texting.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">The system will be able to send text messages via voice commands and read incoming text messages as well. But it will also have an on-screen element, which displays the message, whether incoming or outgoing, on the screen for visual confirmation of what&#8217;s being said, with is a component Apple CarPlay lacks today.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Rivian Assistant will be able to integrate with third-party systems, like Google Calendar, and bring those components into the vehicle&#8217;s native navigation system or even have the system make changes to those applications, like move an appointment on a Google Calendar.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">The goal of all this is to &#8220;get people off their phones,&#8221; a Rivian spokesperson told <em>The Drive</em>.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Users will be able to say &#8220;can you navigate to my next appointment,&#8221; or &#8220;what&#8217;s on my calendar&#8221; or ask the system to send a text message with the ability to see said message via a dialog on the screen.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">&#8220;This is not phone mirroring, this is next-gen stuff,&#8221; a Rivian spokesperson told <em>The Drive</em>.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Because the assistant is vehicle-based, things that used to take multiple taps and swipes on today&#8217;s system via the touchscreen will now be done <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/rivian-exec-says-the-buttons-in-your-car-are-a-bug-and-voice-commands-are-better" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via a voice command</a> like simply saying, &#8220;make all the seats toasty except mine.&#8221;</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">&#8220;We are moving past this point where the way we interact with our apps is screen based. We are moving to a context-based future,&#8221; a Rivian spokesperson told <em>The Drive</em> when asked why this voice-based system is better than phone mirroring such as Apple CarPlay.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Robby DeGraff, AutoPacific’s manager of product and consumer insights, told <em>The Drive</em>, &#8220;Familiarity is key reason why having Apple CarPlay/Android Auto is such a make-it-or-break-it for consumers. We’re glued to our phones and tablets all day, have consequently become comfortable and dependent on their operating systems, and want to retain that familiarity and ease on the go when we’re behind the wheel.&#8221;</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">&#8220;If more automakers can mirror that level of pain-free intuitiveness in their software and infotainment’s operating systems, then I think we’ll see more consumers begin to open to the idea of stepping out of their comfort zone and overlook having routine Apple CarPlay/Android Auto connectivity in their vehicle. The approach and alternative <em>has</em> to be executed flawlessly, it can’t be half-baked,&#8221; DeGraff said.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Rivian Assistant will make use of the vehicle&#8217;s data connection and be part of the automaker&#8217;s Connect+ data package, which costs $14.99 per month or $149.99 annually after a free 60-day trial.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Rivian said the third-party agent integration will be added &#8220;a little later&#8221; after the initial phased rollout of Rivian Assistant in early 2026.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip"><em>Got a tip about future tech?

The system relies on map data in conjunction with the vehicle&#8217;s cameras and radar sensors, and thus only works on mapped roads. The new UHF system moves into a real-time future.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Rivian said the system will operate on- and off-highway on roads with clearly painted lines, marking a large expansion of capabilities over today&#8217;s system. </p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">A Rivian spokesperson told <em>The Drive</em>, &#8220;the 3.5 million (mile) estimate is based on our analysis of marked roads using a third-party data source.&#8221; This implies the UHF system is not relying on map data to operate like today&#8217;s Enhanced Highway Assist and is working in real-time to understand road conditions. This is also what unlocks the exponential increase of area in which drivers will be able to have Rivians operate in hands-free mode.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">The UHF system will operate much like today&#8217;s Enhanced Highway Assist in terms of operation, a Rivian spokesperson told <em>The Drive</em>. It&#8217;ll be engaged by pulling the gear towards the driver twice.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">The UGH system leverages Rivian&#8217;s second-generation electrical architecture and sensor array, meaning all second-generation R1T and R1S models will receive the free over-the-air software update unlocking the capabilities. First-generation R1 models, which do not have today&#8217;s Enhanced Highway Assist, will not be capable of UHF and will not receive this feature.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">That hardware list is extensive and includes an in-house developed RTK GNSS (real-time Kinematic Global Navigation Satellite System) that uses a GPS plus ground station signal to refine the vehicle&#8217;s position to within 20 cm of its latitude and longitude, 10 external cameras, 12 ultrasonic sensors, 5 radar units, and a high-precision GPS receiver.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">To date, Rivian has given second-generation R1 owners its Autonomy+ suite, which includes the Enhanced Highway Assist function, for free billing this as a free trial through the end of 2025. When UHF rolls out, and it replaces today&#8217;s system, Rivian will continue this free trial for customers initially. The automaker plans to start charging $49.99 per month or a one-time $2,500 in 2026 with new owners receiving a 60-day free trial. If the one-time $2,500 is paid rather than a monthly subscription the lifetime Autonomy+ access will follow the vehicle for its entire lifecycle regardless of ownership change.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">This is all the start of what&#8217;s to come, a Rivian spokesperson told <em>The Drive</em>. The UHF system will continue to evolve with more capabilities rapidly. Over the next year UHF will see the addition of stoplight and stop sign detection, among other features.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">The trajectory of Rivian&#8217;s hands-free system, according to the automaker, is full Level 4 point-to-point eyes-off hands-off driving capabilities. This is to be enabled by a new in-house designed silicon chipset and the addition of Lidar, which will first launch on the R2 late in 2026.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip"><em>Got a tip about future tech?

The 5nm chip puts processing and memory onto a single module and is paired with the automaker&#8217;s Gen 3 Autonomy Computer (ACM3), which is an evolution of today&#8217;s ACM2 that launched in 2025 on the <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/car-reviews/2025-rivian-r1s-first-drive-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">second-generation R1</a>.. While RAP1 will be key to the automaker&#8217;s self-driving ambitions, it&#8217;s the addition of a lidar hardware that shows that Rivian thinks the competition&#8217;s approach is flat out wrong.</p>    <figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-7 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="2048" height="1152" loading="lazy" data-id="6580783" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ACM3-2.jpeg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="Rivian's ACM3" class="wp-image-6580783" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="2048" height="1365" loading="lazy" data-id="6580789" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/R2_Lidar_3.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6580789" /></figure> <figcaption class="blocks-gallery-caption wp-element-caption">Rivian&#8217;s RAP1 on ACM3 (left), Rivian R2 with integrated lidar (right) <em>Rivian</em></figcaption></figure>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Lidar will first appear on the upcoming R2 model at the end of 2026. The automaker would not disclose or discuss when, or if, lidar will be added to the R1, but it&#8217;s hard to imagine the more expensive flagship models won&#8217;t adopt the hardware soon after launching on the new R2. </p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Rivian&#8217;s newly announced Universal Hands-Free (UHF) hands-free driver-assist system, which launches later this month on second-generation R1 models via a free over-the-air software update dubbed 2025.46, will eventually become more advanced with the addition of lidar. The lidar hardware will enable three-dimensional spatial data and redundant sensing along with improved real-time detection for edge-case driving scenarios that today&#8217;s in-house developed RTK GNSS (real-time Kinematic Global Navigation Satellite System) that uses a GPS plus ground station signal to refine the vehicle&#8217;s position to within 20 cm of its latitude and longitude, 10 external cameras, 12 ultrasonic sensors, 5 radar units, and a high-precision GPS receiver might miss.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">A Rivian spokesperson exclusively told <em>The Drive</em> lidar is necessary to and a camera-only system is not good enough (Tesla&#8217;s self-named Full Self Driving system uses only camera and the automaker stripped forward-facing radar units from its cars) because, &#8220;Cameras are a passive light sensor, which means in night conditions and fog they don&#8217;t perform as well as active light sensors like lidar.&#8221;</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Lidar can actually double visibility at night. Cameras are great at seeing the world until they can&#8217;t,&#8221; the spokesperson told <em>The Drive</em>.</p>    <figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-8 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="2048" height="1365" loading="lazy" data-id="6580787" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/R1_Lidar_1.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6580787" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="2048" height="1365" loading="lazy" data-id="6580788" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/R2_Lidar_2.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6580788" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="2048" height="1365" loading="lazy" data-id="6580790" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/R2_Lidar_4.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="Rivian R2 equipped with lidar" class="wp-image-6580790" /></figure> <figcaption class="blocks-gallery-caption wp-element-caption">Rivian R2 equipped with lidar <em>Rivian</em></figcaption></figure>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Sam Abuelsamid, vice president of market research at Telemetry told <em>The Drive</em>, &#8220;Having multiple sensing modes is essential to provide a robust and safe ADS solution. Each of the different sensor types has strengths and weaknesses and they are all complementary. To each other. Cameras are excellent for object classification but they perform poorly in low light or when the sun shines directly into them. Unless they are configured for stereoscopic vision, they are also poor at determining distance to an object.&#8221;</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">&#8220;Lidar provides resolution in between cameras and radar, works in all lighting and with modern software can even cope with rain and snow. But until recent years, it has been considerably more expensive. However, in the last few years the cost of solid state lidar has come down substantially and some of the latest units from companies like Hesai are under $200,&#8221; Abuelsamid said.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Abuelsamid continued, &#8220;When advocates of camera-only solutions talk about humans only driving with two eyes, they are wrong on multiple counts. Humans use multiple senses when they drive, stereoscopic vision for depth perception (which Tesla doesn&#8217;t have), hearing and touch, feeling the feedback through their hands and back. Eyes have much higher dynamic range than cameras, making them much more useful in adverse lighting and the human brain also processes information very differently and human perception is much better at filtering extraneous information and classifying what it sees.&#8221;</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Rivian told <em>The Drive</em> that at launch, lidar-equipped vehicles will have a new augmented reality visualization in the driver display, plus improved detections of objects around the vehicle—particularly further away and with challenging conditions. Rich spatial data from these vehicles will also be used to improve onboard model performance for all second-generation R1 and later vehicles, including those without lidar. Longer term, lidar-equipped vehicles will also gain exclusive autonomy features enabled by the additional sensor and on-board compute.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Both the lidar and ACM3 paired with RAP1 hardware are all currently undergoing validation and Rivian expects to ship these new pieces of hardware on R2 at the end of 2026.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip"><em>Got a tip about future tech?

Today, it dropped a track-day specific set called the Mobile Track Kit, as a collab with Keis Motorsports. It ain&#8217;t cheap, but it sure is impressive looking.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip"><a href="https://sonictoolsusa.com/products/kies-motorsports-124-pc-custom-track-set-and-case/#specs" rel="nofollow">The &#8220;MTK&#8221; is a 124-piece tool arsenal</a> that tucks neatly into a branded Pelican-style travel case. The tool loadout was picked by Bryan Kiefer, CEO of <a href="https://www.kiesmotorsports.com/" rel="nofollow">Kies Motorsports</a>, a tuning shop in NJ specializing in BMWs (but also does Porsche and other Euros). The items it comes with were chosen &#8220;&#8230; based on years of trackside experience, reflecting a detailed understanding of what performance vehicles need for on-site repairs and adjustments,&#8221; per the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sonic-usa-and-kies-motorsports-launch-co-branded-mobile-track-kit-engineered-for-high-performance-automotive-enthusiasts-302639007.html" rel="nofollow">press release</a>.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">&#8220;The partnership with Sonic allows us to deliver the solution we&#8217;ve always wished existed: a durable, portable, organized track kit that reflects the reality of what performance vehicles actually need when away from the shop,&#8221; Kiefer said.</p>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1920" height="1080" loading="lazy" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/kies-dyno.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="Toyota Supra on a dyno." class="wp-image-6580770" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kies does aftermarket parts installations and dyno tuning at its facility in Hammonton, New Jersey. <em>Kies Motorsports, edited by the author.</em> </figcaption></figure>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Sonic&#8217;s MTK is metric-based and seems to be optimized for BMWs and Porsches, though you should be able to get a lot done on any Euro or Japanese car with this kit. It almost looks like a hypebeast fashion collaboration; &#8220;KIES&#8221; is engraved in a lot of the tools, and has an emblem on the outside of the box. </p>    <figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-9 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"> <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="512" height="512" loading="lazy" data-id="6580763" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tools2a.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="Sonic MTK tool kit closed" class="wp-image-6580763" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="512" height="512" loading="lazy" data-id="6580756" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tools1.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="Sonic MTK tool kit opened." class="wp-image-6580756" /></figure> <figcaption class="blocks-gallery-caption wp-element-caption"><em>Sonic, edited by the author</em></figcaption></figure>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">There&#8217;s an extensive range of sockets, wobblers, extensions, bits, wrenches, and other standard stuff in there, along with specialty sockets, hooks, and pullers that you might need for more finicky jobs. This PDF has the full list of exactly what&#8217;s included:</p>    <div class="wp-block-file"><a id="wp-block-file--media-710f3128-0956-4e44-97b9-b00d2d9d94b3" href="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Sonic-Tools-x-Kies-MTK-Briefing-1.pdf?quality=85">Sonic Tools x Kies MTK Briefing</a><a href="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Sonic-Tools-x-Kies-MTK-Briefing-1.pdf?quality=85" class="wp-block-file__button wp-element-button" download aria-describedby="wp-block-file--media-710f3128-0956-4e44-97b9-b00d2d9d94b3">Download</a></div>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">I just really like how taut and organized the set looks &#8230; did I mention that already? It really puts the Sterilite box I toss my driving-event tools into to shame.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">That said, it&#8217;s also priced considerably higher—the MTK retails for $2,315. I told you, Sonic&#8217;s stuff is always out of my price range! Beyond tool quality and the curation-coolness factor, the brand promises a lifetime warranty. &#8220;Our online warranty process takes 2-3 minutes, and your replacement tool is on the way to you. Replacement tools typically ship in 48 hours,&#8221; Sonic says.</p>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1920" height="1080" loading="lazy" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tools3.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="Sonic MTK kit with a BMW M4." class="wp-image-6580764" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Sonic, edited by the author</em> </figcaption></figure>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">You don&#8217;t need to make a comment about how much cheaper you can find all the items in this kit at Harbor Freight. We know. This is built to a higher standard and probably smells a lot better.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">The only real downside I see to this thing (besides the price) is that the box supposedly weighs just over 100 pounds. That&#8217;ll make it tough to heave into a trunk on your way to the track. Maybe I don&#8217;t need to replace my plastic Walmart-sourced track-day tool loadout right away after all. But I did love looking at the pictures of this new kit and thought you might too.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">And hey, if you do want to build your own set with lower-end gear, copy the parts list!</p>   <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Sonic-Tools-x-Kies-MTK-Briefing.pdf" class="pdfemb-viewer" data-width="max" data-height="max" data-toolbar="top" data-toolbar-fixed="on">Sonic-Tools-x-Kies-MTK-Briefing</a>   <p class="article-paragraph skip"><em>Got a tip?

                <img src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/15-2026-Honda-Prelude-copy.jpg?quality=85"> <p class="article-paragraph skip">If you&#8217;ve been eagerly awaiting the <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/car-reviews/2026-honda-prelude-first-drive-review">Honda Prelude</a>&#8216;s revival, you may be surprised to learn that when the hybrid sports coupe is parked, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DR0YyCykjQV/" rel="nofollow">it can&#8217;t be revved</a>. The two-motor hybrid system that powers it is a unique setup; <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/the-new-honda-prelude-doesnt-have-a-transmission-heres-why">it has no transmission</a>, for example, and the car&#8217;s 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine only works as a gas generator at lower speeds. But that doesn&#8217;t explain why, if you step on the accelerator pedal in park, nothing happens.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">We wanted to know if that was down to an engineering limitation or a deliberate choice by <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/category/honda-news">Honda</a>, so we reached out to the automaker. This is what they told us:</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">&#8220;All Honda&#8217;s hybrid models, including the Prelude, are designed not to rev while idling,&#8221; a company representative said. &#8220;This is a software feature, and it reflects Honda’s commitment to delivering a clean, fuel-efficient hybrid lineup.&#8221;</p>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="2048" height="1364" loading="lazy" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/14-2026-Honda-Prelude-copy.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="Honda Prelude rear three quarter view" class="wp-image-6580748" /> <figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Honda</em></figcaption></figure>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">So there you have it. There is no technical reason why the Prelude can&#8217;t be revved when stationary, which makes sense. After all, when you put your foot on the gas at lower speeds, you&#8217;re revving an engine, albeit one that&#8217;s not coupled to the wheels in that moment. The Prelude also uses synthesized engine sounds in the cabin, and, as Honda has prominently publicized, fake shifts. As &#8220;clean&#8221; as the sports coupe is, it&#8217;s still trying to convey the sounds and sensations of a traditional driving experience.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Now, this may be a controversial opinion, but I don&#8217;t actually think this matters that much. Let&#8217;s be honest: The folks who buy a new Prelude, rather than, say, a Civic Si or Hyundai Elantra N or what have you, are not chasing a lean, mean sport compact. The hybrid system would be part of the appeal for them, not to mention the fuel efficiency it provides. I don&#8217;t think a lack of revving ability is at odds with Honda&#8217;s target clientele in that respect. But what do you think?
