The US federal government's cyber journey began with the first “cyber law” known as the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) of 1986. Initially intended to protect government systems from unsanctioned physical access, the CFAA evolved to prevent all forms of intentional unauthorized access to computer systems, both physical and virtual, especially after the fall-out from the Morris worm Robert Tappan Morris was the first person convicted under the then-new CFAA – one of the first malicious attacks on computer systems unleashed via the then-nascent internet. </span></span></p>  <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">Simultaneously, the Department of Defense began periodically releasing department-specific strategies called the <a href="https://history.defense.gov/Historical-Sources/National-Security-Strategy/" style="color:#467886; text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">National Security Strategies (NSS)</a> in response to the Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986. Assignment of responsibilities for cybersecurity in federal systems came into effect through the Computer Security Act of 1987. It gave powers to the National Security Agency (NSA) to control all sensitive government computer systems while assigning the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as the security enabler for all non-sensitive, unclassified, non-military systems. </span></span></p>  <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">However, it was not until the 1997 <a href="https://history.defense.gov/Historical-Sources/National-Security-Strategy/" style="color:#467886; text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">National Security Strategy (NSS)</a> of the Clinton administration that cyber concerns became intertwined with national security considerations. Referenced reports noted the use of novel digital technologies in warfare between countries. Subsequently, Clinton signed the seminal – albeit now-outmoded – <a href="https://irp.fas.org/offdocs/pdd/pdd-63.htm" style="color:#467886; text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">Presidential Decision Directive 63</a> (PPD-63) to secure the nation’s critical infrastructure. </span></span></p>  <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">Subsequently, a series of high-profile cybersecurity incidents like the <a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/tr/pdf/ADA415104.pdf" style="color:#467886; text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">Love Bug attack</a>, hacking of the Department of Defense and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=119423&amp;page=1" style="color:#467886; text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">NASA by teenagers</a>, and the Y2K panic as well as non-cyber related events like 9/11, led the Bush administration to publish the first comprehensive national cyber strategy. Known as the <a href="https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/pcipb/" style="color:#467886; text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">2003 National Strategy to Secure the Cyberspace</a>, it followed the 2002 <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/topics/cyber-threats-and-advisories/federal-information-security-modernization-act" style="color:#467886; text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA)</a>, which mandated robust security plans for all federal systems.

Additionally, cyberattacks started becoming more sophisticated and targeted, like the spear phishing attack on the Office of the Secretary of Defense. The administration then released two presidential directives targeting cybersecurity – NSPD 38 in 2004 and NSPD 54 (HSPD 23) in 2008. </span></span></p>  <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">The Obama administration built on these directives, especially NSPD 38, and released their first strategy titled the <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/issues/foreign-policy/cybersecurity/national-initiative" style="color:#467886; text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI)</a> in 2009. This era was marked by the emergence of nation state attackers termed Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). In response, the administration further drew from NSPD 38 to create a new Presidential Policy Directive (PPD) 20 that authorized cyber surveillance and offensive capabilities for the United States government. PPD 20 is still classified but is widely available due to the Snowden leaks. This broad-scale support for cyber offense capabilities was new, and it brought along discussions of cyber norms, especially with US involvement in <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-real-story-of-stuxnet" style="color:#467886; text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">Stuxnet</a>.</span></span></p>  <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">Around the same time attacks <a name="_Int_PMeMVosQ" id="_Int_PMeMVosQ">like</a> Operation Aurora, large-scale hacking of the Office of Personnel Management, and the Target hack, among others, demonstrated the growing role of nation-states in cyberattacks. With adversarial national state actors ramping up their cyber capabilities, they increased ransomware attacks on critical infrastructure companies in the United States. These attacks underscored the importance of cyber attack attribution and highlighted the need for public-private coordination at scale. </span></span></p>  <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">The latter was addressed through the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/1353" style="color:#467886; text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">Cybersecurity Enhancement Act (CEA)</a> of 2014 and the <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity%2520Information%2520Sharing%2520Act%2520of%25202015.pdf" style="color:#467886; text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">Cybersecurity Information Sharing (CISA)</a> Act of 2015, laws enacted by Congress to promote awareness and adoption of consensus-based cyber defense best practices and sharing of cyber threat indicators and defensive measures between and among public and private entities. In addition, the Obama administration released the <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/02/09/fact-sheet-cybersecurity-national-action-plan" style="color:#467886; text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">Cybersecurity National Action Plan (CNAP)</a> in 2016, which allotted over <a name="_Int_E4mS65Hy" id="_Int_E4mS65Hy">19 billion dollars</a> to cybersecurity. This plan aimed to modernize federal infrastructure to be cyber resilient, ramp up hiring cyber talent in the government for cyber deterrence teams and improve incident response coordination. </span></span></p>  <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">The 40-page <a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/National-Cyber-Strategy.pdf" style="color:#467886; text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">National Cyber Strategy</a> released in 2018 by the Trump administration offered a robust response to the spate of several high-profile cyber attacks in 2017, including WannaCry, NotPetya, and the Equifax breach. President Trump's strategy built upon previous approaches towards securing critical infrastructure and introduced the concept of “cyber norms” addressing acceptable behavior in cyberspace and developing cyber deterrence strategies against unacceptable behavior. The Trump administration also pushed for adoption of US-based best practices and cyber defense strategies in other countries. </span></span></p>  <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">President Biden's 2023 <a href="https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2025/01/16/executive-order-on-strengthening-and-promoting-innovation-in-the-nations-cybersecurity/" style="color:#467886; text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">National Cybersecurity Strategy</a> had more agency-specific assignments, and its threat identification, response and mitigation measures were developed in response to multiple supply chain attacks, such as Sunburst against SolarWinds and vulnerabilities such as <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/whats-deal-log4shell-security-nightmare" style="color:#467886; text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">log4shell</a>.

However, the major themes or the “pillars” of cybersecurity strategies have largely stayed the same. The five areas common to a national cybersecurity strategy have conventionally been: 1) protecting critical infrastructure, 2) ensuring the resilience of federal systems, 3) public-private partnerships, 4) international cooperation, and 5) awareness and education.</span></span></p>  <ol style="unicode-bidi:embed; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size:12.0pt; font-weight:normal; font-style:normal" type="1"> 	<li style="vertical-align:middle" value="1"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:normal">Protecting critical infrastructure</span></span></span></span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><span style="font-weight:normal"><span style="font-style:normal"> is in many ways the primary catalyst for NCSS. PPD-63, precursor to the first NCSS, was specifically focused on critical infrastructure protection. It included telecommunications, energy, finance, transportation, water, and emergency services as key sectors and led to the establishment of Sector Risk Management Agencies (SRMAs) in the federal government as well as Sector Coordinators, i.e., Sector Coordinating Councils (SCCs) to represent the views of the private sector. For example, the Communications Sector Coordinating Council (CSCC) was set up in 2005 to work with the Department of Homeland Security, its corresponding SRMA. </span></span></span></span></li> 	<li style="vertical-align:middle"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">The goal behind protecting critical infrastructure was to ensure the </span></span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">resilience of federal systems</span></span></span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> so that there is no disruption in the government’s ability to provide services to its citizens and ensuring national security.

One focus of this third pillar is information sharing between the public and private sector with the goal of addressing common vulnerabilities and identifying correlated attacks. This has been advanced by setting up institutions like </span></span><a href="https://www.nationalisacs.org/about-nci"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs)</span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).</span></span></li> 	<li style="vertical-align:middle"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Yet, US critical infrastructure does not stand in isolation, but must exist in a broader international cyber ecosystem. Thus, a fourth pillar of the NCSS often encompasses </span></span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">international cooperation</span></span></span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> on cybersecurity investigations and cyber norms. Earlier administrations enabled such cooperation by signing on to agreements such as the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime. More recently, this kind of cooperation can be seen in United States’ advocacy for </span></span><a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/wassenaar-export-controls-surveillance-tools-new-exemptions-vulnerability-research"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">research exceptions</span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> to the Wassenaar Arrangement’s controls on surveillance technology. </span></span></li> 	<li style="vertical-align:middle"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">The fifth and final pillar tackles </span></span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">training and awareness</span></span></span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> for the human beings who must inevitably manage cyber technologies and be impacted by associated vulnerabilities. The United States, for example, has set up </span></span><a href="https://www.nsa.gov/Academics/Centers-of-Academic-Excellence/"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">NSA Centers of Academic Excellence</span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> to train the next generation of cybersecurity professionals and created a </span></span><a href="https://sfs.opm.gov/"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">CyberCorps program</span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> to support students who wish to receive scholarship for service.</span></span></li> </ol> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item odd"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-9341" id="single-column-text-9341">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Evolution of NCSS</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">The commonality between these five pillars has led to convergence in many cybersecurity policy efforts. For example, recognizing the important of public-private information sharing, the Clinton and Bush administrations set up ISACs, the Obama administration passed CEA, the Trump administration set up CISA, and the Biden administration passed CIRCIA.</span></span></p>  <p><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">However, over the years the nature of the threat landscape has evolved. The 1990s were dominated by hackers, in the 2000s the big challenge was consumer fraud, and the early half of the 2010s were dominated by DDoS attacks, and the latter half by ransomware. The 2020s have been dominated by APTs.</span></span></p>  <p><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Cyber policy priorities have accordingly been adjusted in response to incidents of their time. The Bush strategy focused on the basics of cybersecurity necessary for national security. The Obama strategies looked at cyber defense responsibility distribution and offensive capabilities. The Trump 2017-2020 strategy concentrated on cyber innovation and business incentives for bolstering enterprise cybersecurity tools and protocols. More recently, the Biden strategy sought to place more cyber defense obligations on to the private sector and gave greater consideration to prescribing specific technology tools and measures. </span></span></p>  <p><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">More broadly four key differences have started to emerge. First, the strategies starting with the Trump NCSS have become more forward leaning. Emerging technology areas like Artificial Intelligence, Quantum Computing, Undersea, Space, and the Internet of Things were first introduced in the Trump and Biden strategies. Both strategies promised support for innovation in these technologies but highlighted the need for security. While Trump's strategy focused on a risk-based approach to these technologies, Biden’s approach was more regulatory and technology specific.</span></span></p>  <p><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Second, is the question around incentives and liability. Under the Biden administration the National Security and Telecommunications Advisory Committee’s (NSTAC) <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2024-02/2024.02.12_DRAFT_NSTACM%26IReport_508c.pdf">report on incentives and measurements</a> noted that the level of cybersecurity investment required to address business risk may be different from that required to address national security risks. The report recommended that the government needs to investigate incentives to bridge the gap. However, towards the tail end of the Biden administration there were multiple White House workshops to explore prescriptive measures, indicating a move away from market-based cybersecurity towards a more regulatory approach.</span></span></p>  <p><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Third, there is an increasing acknowledgement that cybersecurity requires an ecosystem wide effort. The Trump administration’s work on cybersecurity extensions to the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2018/01/16/new-changes-to-wassenaar-arrangement-export-controls-will-benefit-cybersecurity/">Wassenaar Agreement</a> will constrain the proliferation of cyber weapons worldwide while allowing legitimate security research to continue. Trump’s NCSS also called for the creation of a Cyber Deterrence Initiative to coordinate response to cyberattacks and drive adherence to norms in cyberspace.</span></span></p>  <p><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Finally, there is also an understanding that these strategies themselves need to be made more effective. To that end, Government Accountability Office (GAO) has <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-23-106826">outlined six desirable criteria</a> for a national cybersecurity strategy. Different administrations have had varying degrees of coverage on these criteria.</span></span></p>  <p><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">However, GAO’s analysis notes two key problems. First, there is still a lack of widely accepted, reliable performance indicators for cybersecurity. This means that while efforts are directed toward enhancing cybersecurity, the absence of suitable, broad-based metrics makes it harder to justify budgeting for, and investing in, cyber defense capabilities – particularly with respect to preventive measures and threat intelligence capabilities that can stop attacks before they are launched. Measurement is a complex problem in the field, due to the evolving nature of threats. Second, strategies are broad in scope, with limited promises on resources and investments. According to the GAO report, it is harder to estimate how much it would cost to secure systems, especially for human resources.</span></span></p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item even"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-9342" id="single-column-text-9342">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">NCSS: The Next Generation </div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">In the United States, national cybersecurity strategies are the primary policy instrument for articulating the government’s priorities. As future administrations look to frame their own priorities, it may be helpful to consider what made these strategies successful, address opportunities that were previously missed to avoid potential pitfalls for the future. </span></span></p>  <ol> 	<li style="margin-left:8px; text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"><b>Continue building on known successes:</b> Cybersecurity as a policy area enjoys bipartisan support. Thus, each administration has built upon the previous administration’s strategies. This has led to successful programs that have stood the test of time and been widely praised by academia, civil society, and industry. One example is the <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/" style="color:#467886; text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">National Vulnerability Database (NVD)</a>, which is a repository of software and hardware vulnerabilities maintained by the United States government.</span></span></li> 	<li style="margin-left:8px; text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"><b>Focus on outcome-oriented and risk informed policy solutions:</b> Given the ever-evolving nature of technology and associated attacker capabilities, cyber policies need to be technology neutral and focus on the desired outcomes. The scope of the outcomes should be determined by the associated risk, which may differ based on numerous factors such as context of deployment, industry, and more. One example of this approach is the NIST Cyber Security Framework (CSF). </span></span></li> 	<li style="margin-left:8px; text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"><b>Build capacity to address strategic risks:</b> Emerging technologies, such as AI and Quantum Computing, create new and ecosystem wide risks for cybersecurity. The US has historically built capacity to address these kinds of risks by engaging in open, transparent, multistakeholder processes. <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/CyberTrustMark" style="color:#467886; text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">US Cyber Trust Mark</a>, for instance, is a risk-based public-private approach to address the risks imposed by IoT devices, informed by NIST’s IoT security workstreams.</span></span></li> </ol>  <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">As cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, it is important for policymakers to be pro-active, agile, and forward-looking, and not simply reactionary to specific events. The success of US National Cyber Security Strategies can be attributed to the focus on longer term cybersecurity outcomes that are risk informed and grounded in the five pillars or themes. Previous administrations adhered to this recipe for success with the creation of CISA, the elevation of the US Cyber Command, its negotiations on the Wassenaar Arrangement, and more. Future administrations can continue the successful legacy of NCSS by staying true to its roots. </span></span></p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div></div></div><legend><span class="fieldset-legend">Appendix</span></legend><div class="fieldset-wrapper"><div class="field field-name-field-lvl2-appendix-refs field-type-text field-label-above"><div class="field-label">References:&nbsp;</div><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><a class="anchor" name="reference-1"></a></div><div class="field-item even"><a class="anchor" name="reference-2"></a></div><div class="field-item odd"><a class="anchor" name="reference-3"></a></div><div class="field-item even"><a class="anchor" name="reference-4"></a></div><div class="field-item odd"><a class="anchor" name="reference-5"></a></div><div class="field-item even"><a class="anchor" name="reference-6"></a></div><div class="field-item odd"><a class="anchor" name="reference-7"></a></div></div></div></div>

Within 17 hours, one post racked up <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24050334/x-twitter-taylor-swift-ai-fake-images-trending">over 45 million views and 24,000 reposts</a> on X (formerly Twitter).</p>  <p><br /> Commentators called it a glimpse of a dangerous future, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/31/taylor-swift-ai-pictures-far-right?utm_source=chatgpt.com">“the tip of an enormous iceberg.”</a>  But here’s the truth: <strong>this isn’t the future. It’s the present, and even the recent past.</strong></p>  <p><br /> We had the research goal of studying this present – to study the ecosystem facilitating the creation of such images. The results of our research appear in <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/gibson">our forthcoming USENIX Security 2025 paper.</a> </p>  <p><br /> We did not begin our research lightly. From the start, we knew that studying image based sexual abuse would mean engaging directly with potentially abusive content. We also knew that the harm was already happening. </p>  <p>At scale. In plain sight. </p>  <p><br /> We chose to do this work not because we were desensitized to it, but because we are not. As security researchers, we believe we have a responsibility to study, understand, and thereafter expose how tools of abuse operate. Further, as security researchers we have the opportunity to not just study and understand the mechanics of tools used for non-consensual or adversarial purposes, but to advocate, with a solid and informed scientific understanding, for those harmed by them. </p>  <p><br /> In choosing to conduct our research, we want to make one thing very clear: this is not easy work. The second half of this article offers a roadmap for anyone thinking about studying this space. Harm doesn’t stop at the victim-survivors depicted. It can reach the researchers too.</p>  <p><br /> While Swift’s case briefly made headlines, a whole ecosystem of AI-based tools that enable “nudification” – tools advertised to be able to estimate the biology beneath the subject's clothing – has been quietly thriving on the web for years. Some websites claim to have been selling the ability to create AI-generated nudes since 2018. These websites do not require technical sophistication, access to GPU farms, or advanced knowledge on how to circumvent generative AI safeguards. These commercial products are made specifically to nudify people. Open to the public with a few clicks and a credit card. For as little as 6 cents or sitting through ads, and in some cases barely 15 seconds later you can, as one platform phrases it: <em>see any Girl clothless with the click of a button. </em></p>  <p><br /> Another sells its services to those who, <em>Don’t dare talk to the person you love? [No problem!] Upload her photo here and find out what she looks like when she… (haha)</em> </p>  <p><br /> These websites scale image-based sexual abuse (a form of sexual violence that encompasses the non-consensual creation and/or distribution of an intimate image depicting someone). <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Image-based-Sexual-Abuse-A-Study-on-the-Causes-and-Consequences-of-Non-consensual-Nude-or-Sexual-Imagery/Henry-McGlynn-Flynn-Johnson-Powell-Scott/p/book/9780367524401?srsltid=AfmBOoqIRru2RcZsPdJTriPvqOEyk3oVA2kO7FHY7y_lMoMn-3KX5miy">Research finds </a> that such abuse can lead to similar harms as other forms of sexual violence. Not to mention <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/charlotte-child-sexual-abuse-material-case-shows-unsettling-reach-of-ai-generated-imagery" target="_blank">several existing cases</a> of these tools being used to create child sexual abuse material.</p>  <p><br /> What you will find on these sites is startling. It is not just in their output, but in their presentation. The moment you land on the homepage, you’re greeted by non-consensual images of nude women. One site featured <strong>A-list Hollywood celebrities</strong> inserted into extremely explicit scenes. Often, animated GIFs demonstrate the product’s main feature: the transformation of a clothed woman into their AI-generated naked form without her consent. The aesthetic is sleek and accessible. Claims about the computer vision techniques used such as inpainting and the number of hours and images the models have been trained abound. One site boasts<strong> over 100,000 daily users</strong>, framing participation not as deviance, but as the norm.</p>  <p><br /> And if nudifying strangers alone isn’t enough? Most platforms offer an opportunity to spread the word: affiliate programs that pay up to 50% commissions. Some platforms even offer an API so you can spin-off and build your own nudification site. They’ve built the infrastructure. You just plug it in.</p>  <p><br /> These are not isolated tools. They are part of a fledgling, modular abuse economy with monetized referral programs, commercial customer support, and web analytics built in. We are not witnessing a fringe perversion of generative AI’s potential. We are watching the logical outcome of what happens when that potential is turned into a product, one optimized to exploit intimacy, identity, and desire for profit. In <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/gibson" target="_blank">our forthcoming USENIX Security 2025 paper</a>, we studied twenty such websites as of August 2024. We discuss and reflect on some of our findings in this article.</p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item even"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-9352" id="single-column-text-9352">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Ease of Use</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p>It used to take expertise if you wanted to make a convincing deepfake, let alone a nude one, you needed the right knowledge, the right tools, or the right forum. You coded it yourself, digging through Reddit threads for model checkpoints and Colab notebooks, or paid someone on a site like the now defunct Mr. Deepfakes forum.</p>  <p><br /> It was niche. Technical. Or, expensive and that kept most people out.</p>  <p><br /> That era is over. <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/han" target="_blank">Another forthcoming USENIX Security 2025</a> paper finds commission-takers on Mr. Deepfakes charged an average of $87.50 for a video, two orders of magnitude more than the average cost of $0.64 we observe for nudification websites. That gap doesn’t just reflect a drop in price — it reflects a collapse in barriers. </p>  <p><br /> Nudification platforms have gone fully mainstream, not just in visibility, but in usability. Nineteen out of the twenty AI nudification websites we studied explicitly focused on the undressing of women or the nude female form. These aren’t hidden behind the Tor anonymity service or pasted in shady Discord servers. They’re advertised on <a href="https://www.404media.co/instagram-advertises-nonconsensual-ai-nude-apps/" target="_blank">Instagram </a>and hosted in app stores. Polished. Commercial. Accessible from your laptop. Your phone. Your browser. What once required money, effort, and visiting a dedicated forum is now available for pocket change to anyone with a Wi-Fi connection.</p>  <p><br /> There’s no need to know what a GAN (generative adversarial network) is.<br />      No need to train an AI model.<br />      No need to even understand what a deepfake is.<br />      Just upload an image.<br />      Click a button.<br />      Download an image of someone’s naked body, without their consent.<br />      That’s it.<br />      The barriers are paper-thin. </p>  <p><br /> Not a single one of the twenty platforms includes <strong>any form of explicit consent check</strong>, verifying that the person in the image gave consent to be nudified.<br /> Seven sites claim the person being nudified should be 18 or older, but that disclaimer is buried — each one tucked into the Terms of Service, invisible unless you go looking for it. The implication is clear: so long as you click “I agree,” it’s open season.</p>  <p><br /> These platforms go out of their way to make participation as seamless as possible. Half of the sites — ten out of the twenty — let you browse non-consensual imagery without creating an account at all. Four never required login at any point, even when purchasing credits and generating images. </p>  <p><br /> And when you decide to register? Mainstream platforms lend their credibility. Twelve platforms offered Google single sign-on. Others offered Discord, Apple, or X. Familiar, trusted brands. A few clicks and you're in.</p>  <p><br /> Payments are just as easy and credible. Visa. Stripe. PayPal. Google Pay. Cryptocurrency Gateways. Between cryptocurrency gateways and some platforms not even requiring a login, users can be practically anonymous from end to end. </p>  <p><br /> These platforms have erased the friction that once may have stopped the initial casual curiosity.</p>  <p><br /> This isn’t just lowering the barrier of engaging in image-based sexual abuse  — it’s removing the barrier entirely. These sites aren’t just passively harmful. They’re set up to enable harm. Some even offer to scrape images directly from Instagram. In doing so, they’ve blown the lid off the old narrative that deepfakes are only for political figures or celebrities. They’ve made it clear:<strong> if you have a face, you’re a potential target.</strong></p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item odd"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-9353" id="single-column-text-9353">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">More Than Nudification</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p>At first glance, these platforms claim to do one thing: undress the person in a photo. But over half of the 20 platforms we studied offered more than simple “undressing.” Nine let users go further, placing the image subject into different sexual positions and even videos. These weren’t just static nudes. These were synthetic sexual scenes, rendered from uploaded photos.

Nudification sites are exploiting their customers' motivations: pushing them to spread their images. With branded watermarks on them or referral links underneath them, these images serve to spread the nudification tools that generated them. </p>  <p><br /> These platforms don’t just offer features. They offer profit. Many run affiliate and referral programs with revenue shares as high as 50%. Drive traffic, bring in users, and the site will pay you back — not just in credits to generate images, but even in cash. Several platforms sold white-label APIs, enabling customers to build and launch their own nudificattion sites. Buyers could change the interface, set their own pricing, adjust how fast images were processed, even provide their own branding. In some cases, they could remove the original platform’s watermark entirely and replace it with their own.</p>  <p>This isn’t a one-off tool. It’s an industry blueprint. A commercial product pipeline optimized for synthetic sexual exploitation at scale. This isn’t the democratization of deepfakes. It’s the commercialization of abuse.</p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item odd"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-9355" id="single-column-text-9355">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Recommendations – and a Word of Caution</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p>Our USENIX Security 2025 paper goes into detail about potential interventions for platform accountability, including financial deplatforming, affiliate disruption, and third-party enforcement pathways. Those recommendations are nuanced, technically grounded, and worth reading in full.</p>  <p>But here, we want to focus on something different: how to ethically research AI-generated sexual abuse content like that produced by nudification tools. From day one, our team grappled with how to conduct this work responsibly. Not just methodologically, but ethically. Those conversations haven’t ended, and they shouldn’t. Because while our qualitative walkthrough of all 20 platforms yielded valuable insights, it is not a method we universally recommend. Especially not without serious forethought.</p>  <p>There are two ethical stories that must be told in parallel: protecting the people depicted in these images, and protecting the people who study them. We consider both below, starting with the latter.</p>  <h2><strong>1. Protecting Researchers from Harm</strong></h2>  <p><br /> Studying systems that generate or facilitate abuse can take a toll. The harm doesn’t just happen “out there,” to image subjects or end users in the wild. It can happen inside research teams, too.</p>  <p>We want to be clear: nude imagery is not inherently abusive. But content that is non-consensual or depicts abuse — even if generated synthetically — can be deeply distressing to view. During our study, one researcher completed the full application walkthrough for all twenty websites. A second researcher conducted walkthroughs for a subset of ten sites to establish inter-rater reliability. Seventeen sites included nude imagery, but one in particular stood out. Although it advertised itself for “fake” nude imagery, it depicted well-known women in non-consensually graphic sexual acts.</p>  <p>The researcher who first encountered the site immediately closed the computer. Later, when other team members stumbled across it despite knowing it was coming, the responses were physical: one jumped in their chair, another pushed back from the screen. Afterward, we flagged the site in red and issued a team-wide warning to ensure no one encountered it unprepared.</p>  <p>These reactions weren’t overreactions. They were signals, reminders that emotional and psychological safety needs to be part of research design. In our case, we created systems to support that safety: content flags, optional task rotation, and open office hours with a mental health professional. But more than policies, we learned that psychological safety starts with creating a culture where discomfort is valid and boundaries are respected, especially for early-career researchers who may feel pressure to endure more than they should.</p>  <p>But these are only part of the story. There are other ethical questions too.</p>  <h2>2.Protecting Image Subjects from Further Harm</h2>  <p><br /> Just because a study happens in an academic setting doesn’t mean the material loses its sensitivity, nor that researchers cannot themselves engage in further abuses. Research isn’t a loophole. Studying synthetic sexual abuse imagery still carries ethical responsibility to the real people whose likenesses are being used, often without their knowledge, consent, or recourse.</p>  <p>The nudity in the images we studied may be AI-generated, but the harm they inflict can mirror that of image-based sexual abuse using non-synthetic content.</p>  <p>And when researchers reproduce, test, or analyze these systems using real, unconsenting faces, even in academic settings, they risk compounding the very harm they seek to understand.</p>  <p>Researchers themselves are not a loophole for ethical consent. No one should be asked, whether directly or implicitly, to supply their own photo or anyone else’s for system testing. Even with consent, the ethics are murky. Does the consenting individual truly understand the long-term risks — from dataset leaks to future model misuse? Do they truly feel comfortable saying no to a direct supervisor? Consent in this context is complicated by power dynamics, institutional pressure, and the unforeseeable life cycle of machine learning artifacts. We must not study abuse by recreating it.</p>  <p>In our ongoing work, we are exploring the use of fully synthetic human subjects: AI-generated image inputs that allow system behavior to be studied without creating new victims (we use images with covered faces as AI systems may replicate real people’s identities when generating content). But ethics go beyond inputs. Researchers must also reflect on the implications of storing, analyzing, and sharing these outputs, and build systems that minimize harm throughout the research pipeline.</p>  <p>For those considering research in this space, we offer the following as minimum recommendations:</p>  <p><strong>Think critically about consent in both your dataset and your team structure.</strong> What would it mean to design research that harms no one — not even in the process of studying harm? Consider synthetic imagery, anonymization, or other alternatives that decenter real identities, while looking for methods that empower researchers and protect them.</p>  <p><strong>Develop clear internal protocols for physical, financial, and psychological safety. </strong>This includes opt-out policies, content warnings, as well as protections as safety precautions like burner accounts and devices and open options to rotate, pause, or exit work. For us, this meant a designated on-call mental health professional and internal systems to warn against graphic content before it was opened, and researchers used burner emails to create their accounts on each nudification website.</p>  <p><br /> <strong>Discuss ethics continuously. </strong>When working with potentially traumatizing material, your first approval shouldn’t be your last conversation about ethics. IRB signoff is a starting point, not a finish line.</p>  <p><strong>Realize that IRB is not sufficient.</strong>  Some of the most pressing ethical risks such as long-term psychological harm, reputational risk to image subjects, or the replication of abusive dynamics may fall outside the scope of traditional IRB frameworks. Researchers need to go further by engaging deeply in their own ethical analyses.</p>  <p><strong>Recognize that even consent has limits.</strong>  A person’s agreement does not automatically make a methodology ethical, especially in research involving long-term and unknown risks when no one knows where AI will be in the next month, let alone in five years. Power dynamics can cloud what “freely given” really means, and the downstream consequences of reusing a real person’s likeness may not be foreseeable at the time of consent. Consent must be treated as an ongoing process and as one layer of ethical consideration; not the final word.</p>  <p>The abuse we studied isn’t just technical. It’s intimate, interpersonal, and deeply rooted in power –  both the power these tools simulate, and the power they give to those who use them.  Studying this ecosystem responsibly demands more than rigor. It demands reflection, caution, and care for both the people in the images and the researchers themselves.<br />  </p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item even"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-9356" id="single-column-text-9356">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Acknowledgements</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p>This work was supported by the US National Science Foundation under grants CNS-2205171, CNS-2206950, and the University of Washington Tech Policy Lab.</p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div></div></div><legend><span class="fieldset-legend">Appendix</span></legend><div class="fieldset-wrapper"><div class="field field-name-field-lvl2-appendix-refs field-type-text field-label-above"><div class="field-label">References:&nbsp;</div><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><a class="anchor" name="reference-1"></a></div><div class="field-item even"><a class="anchor" name="reference-2"></a></div><div class="field-item odd"><a class="anchor" name="reference-3"></a></div><div class="field-item even"><a class="anchor" name="reference-4"></a></div><div class="field-item odd"><a class="anchor" name="reference-5"></a></div><div class="field-item even"><a class="anchor" name="reference-6"></a></div><div class="field-item odd"><a class="anchor" name="reference-7"></a></div><div class="field-item even"><a class="anchor" name="reference-8"></a></div><div class="field-item odd"><a class="anchor" name="reference-9"></a></div><div class="field-item even"><a class="anchor" name="reference-10"></a></div><div class="field-item odd"><a class="anchor" name="reference-11"></a></div></div></div></div>

On a Friday night, Deborah and Kenneth went for a dinner date at an Italian place downtown. They had chatted briefly on a dating app and decided that getting to know someone is much easier in-person. However, throughout the date Deborah didn't feel any spark, it seems they both had less in common than she initially thought. That happens. They amicably parted ways and went home. However, the next day, Kenneth appeared in front of Deborah's house to aggressively ask her what he did wrong. She never told him her address, but he somehow found out how to find her. What Deborah didn't realize: Kenneth had hidden a location tracker in her jacket when she wasn't looking.</p>  <p>This is a form of tech-facilitated abuse — a growing problem [<a href="https://www.usenix.org/publications/loginonline/hidden-cost-location-tracking#reference-1">1</a>]. Stalking with the help of technology isn't a new concept. GPS trackers and other spy devices have been commercially available for decades. However, they were hard to obtain, often requiring a venture to the dark web. They were more expensive, bulky, and less usable. There is also a mental burden to overcome before buying a dedicated stalking device.</p>  <p>However, design and availability matter. Location trackers have gotten smaller, cheaper, more precise, and more usable through their native support on smartphones. These new types of location trackers are small devices similar in size to a coin or credit card. Their batteries last months or years, making them convenient for tracking keys, wallets, luggage, or other belongings. They are so small and power-efficient because they rely on a network of other devices to determine and relay their location. Manufacturers that use these networks don't need to integrate GPS and cellular connectivity, saving cost and lowering power consumption as well as device footprint. With this convenient set of features, state-of-the-art location trackers can be misused to locate and track people without consent by sneakily putting a tracker on them.</p>  <p>When Apple introduced its AirTag location trackers, they knew they would be misused for stalking [<a href="https://www.usenix.org/publications/loginonline/hidden-cost-location-tracking#reference-2">2</a>]. They added two main features to the ecosystem to protect people from AirTag-based stalking: audible alarms and messages that pop up on iPhones. If AirTags are outside the owner's range for a sufficiently long time, they emit a chirping sound when moved. This alarm could be the first indication to other people that something unusual is afoot. Additionally, people with iPhones receive a notification about an unknown device following them, usually when they arrive at home or work. Since last year, these notifications have also been available on Android phones. These notifications support all kinds of location trackers that rely on Google or Apple's location-tracking network.</p>  <p>Ideally, Deborah receives a notification on her phone about the location tracker that Kenneth hid in her jacket, which looks similar to the one shown below.</p>  <p><img alt="A smartphone notification indicates &quot;AirTag Found Moving With You.&quot; The notification states &quot;The owner can look up its location." src="/sites/default/files/2025-07/utn_ios_outline.png" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; " /></p>  <p>Knowing the situation, she can now react: Find the location tracker, deactivate it by removing the battery, or innocently “forget” the tracker at a place that isn't her home.</p>  <p>Our study, published at USENIX Security [<a href="https://www.usenix.org/publications/loginonline/hidden-cost-location-tracking#reference-3">3</a>], examined how well these anti-stalking mechanisms work in real-world conditions. Are these notifications delivered reliably and timely? Do people who don't expect a safety-critical notification understand the potential danger they are in? Are the available tools effective in helping people find and deactivate location trackers?</p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item even"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-9286" id="single-column-text-9286">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Our approach</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p>To investigate the anti-stalking features of Apple AirTags, we performed two studies to evaluate their effectiveness in the real world. We chose AirTags as the best-case example because their feature suite was considered among the most robust at the time of writing, and they operate within the largest tracking network.</p>  <p>In the first study, we gave 50 participants an active AirTag to take with them. Our goal was to determine whether each participant would reliably receive a tracking notification and how long it would take. Half used iPhones, and the other half had compatible Android phones. This allowed us to compare performance across operating systems and hardware configurations.</p>  <p>The second study required a more creative approach as we wanted to see how people would react to a tracking notification if they weren't expecting to receive one. To achieve this, we conducted a deception study giving participants a visually disguised AirTag in the context of a study about activity tracking. Participants took the hidden tracker with them, not knowing its real purpose, and most of them received a tracking notification within the next 24 hours. After this experience, participants told us about their thoughts and reactions during an interview. We then asked these participants to find a hidden AirTag in a car that we prepared so they could share their thoughts about the locating features.</p>  <p>Ethical research is always a top priority in our research. Thus, we ensured the privacy and safety of our participants during each part of this project. This started with setting up the trackers so that we couldn't access their location, and we included multiple opportunities for participants to ask questions and drop out, among many other precautions.</p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item odd"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-9287" id="single-column-text-9287">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Will your smartphone warn you if you are being tracked?</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p>One of the first considerations when thinking about the possibility of being tracked with an AirTag is whether you would realize it in time. A tracking notification on iOS and Android is supposed to help with that. In practice, this is likely the first time potential victims become aware that a tracker is moving with them. However, this requires the notification to reliably appear in the first place. </p>  <p>In the first part of our study, we ran an experiment with 50 participants to test this reliability. We found that the tracking notification for a foreign AirTag is reliably delivered on all tested iOS devices. Unfortunately, only 14 out of 25 participants with an Android phone received the alert, making them more susceptible to prolonged stalking. It is important to note that these numbers were collected under relatively ideal conditions. All tested phones supported the warning notification. They were set up and configured such that the notification could appear, and participants consistently carried the tracker with them. If someone used an unsupported or no phone, or disabled settings such as Bluetooth and location services, they would never receive a warning notification. In such cases, potential victims would have to discover the tracker themselves, possibly with the help of the chirping sound AirTags occasionally play.</p>  <p>The time it takes for the notification to be delivered varies greatly, and in most cases, it is delivered after someone reaches their home. This isn't a coincidence <meta charset="UTF-8" />— it is a deliberate feature to reduce false positives on all the smartphones and surrounding trackers they encounter on a regular basis. Unfortunately, this has the unintended consequence of letting a potential stalker know where you live before you receive a warning.</p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item even"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-9288" id="single-column-text-9288">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Is the tracking notification helpful?</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p>Imagine receiving a tracking notification, and the title reads “AirTag Found Moving With You.” The text below says, “The owner can look up its location.” What does this tell you? Assume you didn't know what <em>AirTag</em> meant. Also, what does it mean for this thing to move with me? Is that bad?</p>  <p>We used a deception study to explore whether users would understand the warning and know how to react to it. The 19 participants of this part of the study unknowingly carried an AirTag that would trigger a tracking notification on their phones. Then, they would have to decide how to respond. In an interview shortly after, they shared their experience. We found that technology understanding played a crucial role in how effective their reactions were.</p>  <p>If someone exhibited less technical knowledge, they often took ineffective actions. For example, one participant mentioned switching off their phone to protect themselves, but this wouldn't stop the tracker from functioning. Participants with a higher understanding of the technology performed more effective actions. They would typically try to locate the tracker by playing the chirping sound and then consider disabling or disposing of it. Anyone can be a victim of stalking, so an understanding of this technology shouldn't be a requirement to be adequately protected.</p>  <p>The phrasing and presentation of the notification also caused confusion with some of our participants. The user interface never explicitly states the potential threat, leaving users to infer the risk on their own. If they cannot do so, they may disregard the warning and keep being surveilled. Companies may want to refrain from mentioning threats to avoid associations with stalking and similar misuse of their products. Nevertheless, it would likely help potential victims to know their situation, especially if they have no prior knowledge of this topic.</p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item odd"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-9289" id="single-column-text-9289">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">How difficult is it to find a hidden tracker?</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p>Lastly, we wanted to see how difficult it would be to find a reasonably well-hidden tracker and where the challenges lie. We asked our participants to find an AirTag we hid in the trunk of a car. During the finding process and a short interview after, they told us how well the built-in locating features worked for them. We used an iPhone and the pre-installed <em>Find My</em> app shown below for this task. Some participants didn't know which feature did what and how they worked. Most functions lack a description in favor of short labels like “Play Sound.” This led to confusion where participants wouldn't know whether the sound was coming from their phone or the hidden tracker. Many participants struggled with hearing the faint chirping sound at all.</p>  <p><img alt="A hand holds an iPhone displaying a &quot;AirTag Detected Near You&quot; notification in the Find My app. The screen shows options to &quot;Play Sound&quot; and &quot;Find&quot; the AirTag, along with an option to &quot;Pause Tracking Notifications&quot; and links to &quot;Learn About This AirTag&quot; and &quot;Instructions to Disable AirTag.&quot;" src="/sites/default/files/2025-07/find_my_ui.png" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; " /></p>  <p>The visual interface to display direction and distance to an AirTag worked well for those who had it available and found it. Still, it caused confusion when the connection to the tracker was unreliable, or when the interface toggled between showing a direction or only an approximate distance. While our participants reported having no impairments, many explained that they would have had a much harder time finding the tracker if they were hard of hearing or had low vision.</p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item even"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-9290" id="single-column-text-9290">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Move fast and break things — maybe don&#039;t</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p>Location trackers such as AirTags are a modern convenience that helps many find their lost or misplaced items by utilizing a crowd-sourced tracking network.<br /> While this is technologically impressive, it also enables their misuse. The convenience of these devices makes stalking more accessible for abusers while making it harder for potential victims to protect themselves. While the built-in protection mechanisms of AirTags offer a solid foundation and help reduce harm in many instances, they fail to protect everyone. Too much of the burden falls on potential victims. As a result, people now face yet another threat they must be aware of and defend against. This task shouldn't fall on individuals, but on the companies that release and profit from this technology.</p>  <p>The motto “Move fast and break things” has guided the product development approach for many Silicon Valley tech companies. Still, perhaps it is time to acknowledge the real-world consequences of many technologies and reconsider this approach. The warning notifications must be easy to understand and convey urgency so potential victims can accurately assess the risk. The user interface must also guide users to safe responses by offering more assistance and clear descriptions in favor of a minimal and sleek design. Our paper offers more actionable recommendations and urges companies to take responsibility by improving their products so people can feel safe from this threat. We shouldn't allow ourselves to introduce new technologies to the world for dealing minor inconveniences at the cost of serious societal consequences.</p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div></div></div><legend><span class="fieldset-legend">Appendix</span></legend><div class="fieldset-wrapper"><div class="field field-name-field-lvl2-appendix-refs field-type-text field-label-above"><div class="field-label">References:&nbsp;</div><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><a class="anchor" name="reference-1"></a><p>[1] S.

You trust it implicitly; it has reliably navigated you through countless commutes. But this evening, instead of your familiar driveway, the AI confidently directs you to an empty field, miles from anywhere recognizable. At first, it might seem a harmless glitch that only inconveniences your time. But what if someone anticipated this mistake, lying in wait precisely because they knew the AI occasionally misled drivers into this isolated spot? Suddenly, a minor technological hiccup transforms into a serious threat.</p>  <p>This unsettling scenario mirrors a new class of vulnerability that has been discovered in the powerful AI systems increasingly integrated into our daily lives. While our navigation apps remain stable and trustworthy, Large Language Models (LLMs) have swiftly begun reshaping critical areas such as software development, often without the same stability or reliability. Like our hypothetical navigation error, these language models can confidently and convincingly deliver incorrect or even completely fabricated information, a phenomenon referred to as hallucinations. In software development, one way this can manifest are "package hallucinations," which occur when an AI coding assistant recommends a third-party software package that simply does not exist. As in the navigation analogy above, this may seem harmless at first, but this particular type of hallucination opens a new attack vector for malicious actors that has implications for the software supply chain and everyday users alike. </p>  <p>Our research aims to provide the first comprehensive analysis of package hallucinations across a variety of models, settings, and programming language. We not only quantify how often this phenomenon occurs but examine other important characteristics such as persistence, self-detection, and mitigation strategies. </p>  <p>This article serves as an abbreviated version of our <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/spracklen">research paper</a> <a href="#reference-7">[7]</a>, which is set to appear at the USENIX Security Symposium 2025, with expanded discussion on navigating the present environment of highly influential, but imperfect, generative AI systems.</p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item even"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-article-image paragraphs-item-article-image paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-9191" id="article-image-9191">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-article-image field-type-image field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><img src="https://www.usenix.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_embedded/public/figure_1_1.png" width="1440" height="606" alt="" /></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-article-image-caption field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Figure 1: Flowchart for Exploiting Package Hallucinations.

They host millions of packages, providing reusable code components that drastically accelerate software development. Their accessibility and ease of use allow developers to rapidly integrate third-party libraries at no cost. While the centralization and ease of use has been convenient for users, their open-source nature means uploads are anonymous and without rigorous oversight. As such, attackers have long recognized these repositories as fertile ground for planting malware <a href="#reference-1">[1]</a>. Package confusion attacks, where attackers deliberately publish malicious packages with names deceptively similar to legitimate ones, have plagued these repositories for years <a href="#reference-2">[2]</a>. Package hallucinations represent the latest evolution of this threat, amplifying traditional package confusion attacks with AI-driven recommendations, creating a new vector for supply-chain compromises.</p>  <h3>Coding Models</h3>  <p>The rise of competent and proficient coding models including GitHub Copilot, Cursor, ChatGPT, Claude, and various open-source alternatives has transformed software development <a href="#reference-3">[3]</a>. These models are already responsible for generating a significant portion of production code, a trend poised to increase rapidly as the technology improves <a href="#reference-4">[4]</a>. While these systems offer incredible speed and convenience, they are far from infallible. AI-generated code is not immune to mistakes and can include syntax errors, hidden vulnerabilities, or outright fabrications <a href="#reference-5">[5]</a>. Despite these issues, the proficiency of these coding models create incredible efficiency gains that add value to even the most skilled developers. The immense pressure for rapid software delivery means developers often have limited time or resources to thoroughly vet AI-produced outputs. This reliance on AI-generated code is creating a growing opportunity for inadvertent acceptance and implementation of flawed or malicious code.</p>  <h3>Hallucinations</h3>  <p>Hallucinations are a natural by-product of how LLMs operate. These models generate text probabilistically, meaning their outputs are inherently non-deterministic and subject to random sampling errors. While this randomness enables creativity and engaging content, highly desirable qualities, it also introduces the possibility of generating entirely fabricated or factually incorrect information <a href="#reference-6">[6]</a>. Examples of hallucinations include models citing non-existent research papers, inventing plausible-sounding historical events, or confidently providing incorrect technical instructions. Such hallucinations occur frequently enough that developers and users must maintain vigilance and scrutinize output. Advances such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and agentic models have significantly reduced the frequency and severity of these issues, but have not entirely eliminated them. Hallucinations are truly both a feature and a bug, and striking the right balance between accuracy and creativity is a major decision point when introducing models to the public.</p>  <h3>Package Hallucinations</h3>  <p>Package hallucinations occur when an LLM confidently recommends software packages that do not actually exist in the default package repositories. While seemingly harmless, merely imaginary names generated by an AI, these fictitious packages pose severe security risks. Imagine an attacker that notices repeated recommendations for a non-existent package name. They swiftly publish a malicious version of this phantom package on a public repository. Developers following AI recommendations then inadvertently download and install malware disguised as the seemingly legitimate package. The attack is deceptively simple and inexpensive to execute, akin to phishing attacks: low-risk, high-reward scenarios where minimal effort or financial investment can yield substantial damage. Figure 1 illustrates a hypothetical attack flow, showcasing how an initially benign hallucination can rapidly escalate into a dangerous security compromise.</p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item even"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-9193" id="single-column-text-9193">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Experiment Design</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p>The goal of our experiment was to conduct a rigorous and comprehensive test to conclusively quantify how often these package hallucinations occur and how they are impacted by different models, languages, and settings. In short, we chose a variety of models and used each model to generate a large number of code samples which we would then test for the presence of package hallucinations. Detecting package hallucinations given only a sample of code is a very difficult task that would be extremely error prone at best, so instead we used the code samples themselves as a way to prompt the model for more information, similar to what we envision a normal user might do as part of their workflow. Imagine trying to run commands you received from an LLM and receiving an error saying that the package or module was not found. We felt the following 3 scenarios were plausible and formed the basis for our hallucination detection:</p>  <ol> 	<li>Examine the full model response for directions to install a package with <em>"pip install"</em> or <em>"npm install"</em>. Models sometimes include these instructions in the narrative of their response, outside of the actual code block. A package hallucination of this type serves as the most dangerous scenario, because the model is directly recommending that the user run code that would immediately result in malware being downloaded and installed.</li> 	<li>Prompt the model for a list of packages needed to run the code sample.</li> 	<li>Ask the model to recommend a list of packages that could help answer the original question.</li> </ol>  <p>Collecting the results of the three different tests, we would then simply compare each given list to the master list of packages obtained from the relevant repository. If a given package was not found then it was counted as a package hallucination and our overall measurement was hallucination rate, which is simply a ratio of hallucinated packages generated by the model over the number of total packages generated. There were several other important aspects of the experiment that are relevant for the remaining discussion:</p>  <ul> 	<li><strong>Dataset: </strong>We wanted to prompt the models with a very broad range of coding questions, covering as many conceivable topics as possible to test not only the most popular questions but also more niche and obscure subjects. It was also important to include realistic questions that an actual user could plausibly ask. To accomplish both of these goals we used two distinct datasets: an LLM generated set of prompts constructed from scraped repository description data and a set of popular questions scraped from StackOverflow relevant to the programming languages in question. In total, each dataset including about 9,500 prompts, for a total of ~19,000 prompts that were given to each model. </li> 	<li><strong>Models: </strong>The goal was to test a representative sample of the best models available from both open-source and commercial options. We used the HumanEval leaderboard to filter the best performing models at the time our research started, which you can see in Figure 3. Note that this project began in February of 2024 and was first published in June 2024, so while the models are already dated in according to the lightning fast AI-timeline, these were the top performing models when research was started.</li> 	<li><strong>Languages: </strong>We conduct all tests using two programming languages: Python and JavaScript. These two languages are extremely popular and also represent the two largest open-source package repositories: PyPI and npm. These are also the primary languages used in testing the LLM-generated code quality benchmarks, making them a natural choice.</li> </ul> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item odd"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-article-image paragraphs-item-article-image paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-9194" id="article-image-9194">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-article-image field-type-image field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><img src="https://www.usenix.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_embedded/public/model_table.png" width="1197" height="753" alt="" /></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-article-image-caption field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Figure 2: Models used for testing</div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item even"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-9195" id="single-column-text-9195">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Key Findings</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><h3>Prevalence</h3>  <p>Our study identified that all 16 tested coding models exhibited notable rates of package hallucinations, averaging 19.6% across the board. Notably, commercial models performed significantly better, with hallucination rates around 5%, compared to open-source models averaging around 21%. These figures underline that package hallucination is a systemic issue affecting even state-of-the-art commercial offerings, not merely a quirk of small or less capable models. This ubiquity underscores a significant concern: as coding assistance from AI becomes commonplace, the likelihood of unintentionally propagating these hallucinations through software ecosystems grows. The discrepancy between commercial and open-source models also highlights the necessity for ongoing vigilance and improvement, especially within the open-source community, which many developers rely on due to its accessibility, transparency, and adaptability (and of course, cost).</p>  <p>We were also struck by the breadth of fictitious packages confidently recommended by the tested models. In total, <strong>205,474</strong> unique non-existent packages were generated during testing. Each unique package name represents a potential malicious package that could be uploaded to an open-source repository, ready to be downloaded by unsuspecting developers. This vast number indicates not only the scope of the problem but also the ease with which attackers could find multiple opportunities to introduce harmful code. With so many plausible-sounding yet fictitious names, the odds of successfully tricking developers are substantially heightened, posing a very significant risk for software supply-chain security.</p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item odd"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-article-image paragraphs-item-article-image paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-9196" id="article-image-9196">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-article-image field-type-image field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><img src="https://www.usenix.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_embedded/public/figure_3_0.png" width="1440" height="786" alt="" /></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-article-image-caption field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Figure 3: Package Hallucination Rate for Each Model Tested</div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item even"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-9197" id="single-column-text-9197">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><h3>Persistence</h3>  <p>An important aspect of package hallucinations as a threat vector is their persistence, how frequently a hallucinated package reappears in model outputs. If hallucinations were sporadic, single-occurrence errors, their potential threat would be limited. However, our findings demonstrated significant repetition: approximately 45% of hallucinated packages were consistently regenerated every time a model was queried with the same prompt, and about 60% reappeared at least once in 10 subsequent prompts. This recurrence substantially increases their threat profile, providing attackers with reliable and predictable targets for malicious exploitation. The predictability of these hallucinations is something that malicious actors can leverage to their advantage. Essentially, persistent hallucinations create a sustained opportunity for attacks, as attackers can anticipate specific phantom packages appearing again, ensuring their maliciously crafted packages find an audience.</p>  <h3>Self-Detection</h3>  <p>An interesting, and unexpected, discovery was the ability of certain models, particularly ChatGPT and DeepSeek, to self-detect their hallucinations effectively. When these models generated hallucinated packages, they subsequently exhibited an 80% accuracy rate in identifying these packages as fictitious upon re-examination. This reveals a promising avenue for real-time self-correction mechanisms, potentially reducing the dissemination of these phantom packages before they propagate further into software development processes. Nevertheless, the initial confident recommendations followed by self-recognition indicate inherent inconsistencies within model logic and point to complexities in the model's internal evaluation processes. Enhancing such self-assessment capabilities could form an integral part of defensive strategies, serving as a vital checkpoint in automated coding environments where manual verification is often impractical.</p>  <h3>Mitigation</h3>  <p>To address package hallucinations, our experiments explored various mitigation techniques, including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), fine-tuning, self-correction mechanisms, and a combination of all these methods into an ensemble approach. Remarkably, fine-tuning, in which a model's weights are finely calibrating to increase performance on a specific task, on a hallucination-free dataset dramatically reduced the hallucination rate by over 80%, even surpassing the reliability of commercial models like ChatGPT. However, this came at a significant trade-off: a notable decline in the generated code's overall quality. This finding demonstrates that while current mitigation strategies show considerable promise, they remain imperfect solutions. The performance trade-off observed highlights an ongoing challenge to develop methods that significantly curtail hallucinations without sacrificing critical functionality. Future research must strive toward techniques balancing hallucination reduction and maintaining, or even enhancing, code reliability and quality.</p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item odd"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-9198" id="single-column-text-9198">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Discussion, Considerations, and Navigating the New Normal</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><h3>AI Firmly Entrenched in Everyday Life</h3>  <p>The widespread occurrence of package hallucinations underscores a broader reality: Large Language Models are no longer experimental novelties and have woven themselves into the fabric of daily life. Autocomplete suggestions finish our emails, customer-service bots triage our questions, and real-time translators bridge language gaps on video calls. HR platforms rely on LLMs to screen résumés, banking apps embed chat interfaces that explain loan terms, smart-home hubs summarize news, control appliances, and adjust thermostats. In classrooms, AI tutors adapt lessons in real time, while in hospitals models draft chart notes and help route prior-authorization requests. Most relevant to this discussion, coding assistants now sit directly inside IDEs, Git workflows, and CI/CD pipelines to generate boilerplate code, recommend libraries, and even write entire modules. As the boundary between human and AI-generated output blurs, our dependence on these systems deepens, magnifying both their benefit and their risks.</p>  <h3>Hallucinations Are Here to Stay</h3>  <p>For all of the productivity, efficiency, and useful ways LLMs have improved our lives, hallucinations are the tax we pay. Given the probabilistic, non-deterministic nature of LLMs, hallucinations are not simply a bug to be patched but a structural consequence of how these systems operate. This randomness fosters creativity, diversity, and open-ended reasoning that is essential for everything from storytelling to problem-solving. However, it also means that these models will sometimes generate information that sounds plausible but is entirely fabricated.</p>  <p>Great strides in mitigating hallucinations have already been made but eradicating this phenomenon remains an open challenge, especially in high-stakes or long-tail edge cases. Methods like chain-of-thought reasoning, agentic systems, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) only shrink the error surface; they cannot eliminate it. Even if the package hallucination rate was only a fraction of a percent, at the scale of tens of millions of code completions per day that is still tens of thousands of fictitious packages being generated. These mitigation methods will continue to improve, and new methods will likely be developed that continue to diminish the presence of hallucinations. The fact remains, however, that hallucinations are a natural occurrence that directly stems from the basic architecture of an LLM, and it is difficult to envision completely eliminating them without some fundamental change to the entire language model structure. </p>  <h3>The Illusion of  Verification</h3>  <p>A particularly dangerous misconception is that whitelisting package names or using RAG-based validation can fully prevent hallucination-based attacks. This is a common misconception that fools many when first presented with the issue. In reality, a RAG system would rely on maintaining a list of existing packages from repositories like PyPI or npm and checking AI output against that list in real time. But what if an attacker has already registered the hallucinated package? The model's output will appear correct, the package name will pass validation, and the installation will succeed, quietly importing malicious code.</p>  <p>To make matters worse, motivated attackers can go even further: they can build convincing README files, host fake documentation, and set up GitHub repositories that mimic legitimate projects. Even well-meaning developers who perform due diligence may be misled. In this way, package hallucinations represent not just a technical flaw, but a novel, AI-enabled escalation of traditional supply-chain attacks.</p>  <h3>The Rise of "Vibe Coding"</h3>  <p>A troubling development has been in the increase in popularity of "vibe coding," which is the practice of rapidly prototyping or building entire applications by following a model’s suggestions without deeply understanding or reviewing the code. The focus is on speed and not security or verification. Developers with limited experience may accept AI-generated suggestions without hesitation, including hallucinated packages. What once required a strong foundation developed over much time and effort has become a single copy-paste operation. While this ease enables remarkable speed and creativity, it also significantly lowers the barrier for dangerous mistakes. Blindly accepting AI-generated instructions without verification invites exactly the kind of exploitation that package hallucinations make possible.</p>  <h3>The Danger of Confidence</h3>  <p>One underappreciated factor that makes hallucinations especially risky is the unshakable confidence with which LLMs deliver their outputs. These systems are optimized to sound fluent, authoritative, and helpful even when they're wrong. From a business and user experience perspective, this makes sense: users prefer decisiveness over hesitation. But in practice, confident errors are far more dangerous than hesitant ones. A model that fabricates a package name while speaking with assurance provides no cues for doubt. This sets up users, especially those unfamiliar with the underlying technology, for failure. Until models can be trained or configured to express appropriate levels of uncertainty, the burden of skepticism will remain entirely on the user.</p>  <p>Encouraging models to flag low-confidence outputs or provide explicit verifiability cues would help, but adoption of these techniques is still limited. For now, model confidence should not be mistaken for correctness. Developers and end-users alike must remain cautious, especially when AI outputs are actionable, such as installation commands, configuration suggestions, or dependency lists.</p>  <h3>Trust, but Verify</h3>  <p>This does not, in any way, mean abandoning AI copilots: they are wonderful. The lesson is shared responsibility. <strong>Model architects</strong> must treat hallucination risk as a first-class metric, expose confidence scores, and surface verifiability signals in the UI. <strong>Developers</strong> must layer controls: pin dependencies with hashes, run static analyzers in CI, and require human verification for any new package. Many companies host their own internal package repositories and hire companies to ensure that the packages hosted are legitimate and benign, a great practice but also only as good as the detection methods. <strong>Organizations</strong> must educate teams that “AI-generated” is not the same as “reviewed” and build a culture where speed never outranks security.</p>  <p>In short, AI is accelerating software creation at an unprecedented pace, but speed without scrutiny is an open invitation to attackers. Trust the assistant for inspiration and productivity; verify its suggestions before they ship.</p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item even"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-callout paragraphs-item-callout paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-9199" id="callout-9199">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-callout-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p>Like a self-driving car that navigates brilliantly 99% of the time but still requires the human driver to stay focused, LLMs are remarkable guides, provided we keep one hand on the wheel.</p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item odd"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-9200" id="single-column-text-9200">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Conclusion: Charting a Safer Course</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p>Returning to our original analogy, imagine if a GPS app that had guided you safely for years suddenly began inserting phantom destinations. Most drivers wouldn’t think to verify every route before departure. The same is true of developers using LLMs: when a system that you trust confidently hands you an answer, it’s human nature to follow it. But if that answer contains a hallucinated package name that has already been weaponized by an attacker, then even a simple "<em>pip install"</em> command becomes a liability. </p>  <p>AI has the power to elevate software engineering to new heights of speed and scale, but we must proceed with caution. As with any transformative technology, we must look beyond how well it works under ideal conditions and consider the risks it introduces at the margins. Package hallucinations are a clear warning: even when the model seems sure of itself, we must not be.</p>  <p>By embedding awareness, skepticism, and safety practices into our tooling and culture, we can embrace the power of AI without surrendering control to its most dangerous errors.</p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div></div></div><legend><span class="fieldset-legend">Appendix</span></legend><div class="fieldset-wrapper"><div class="field field-name-field-lvl2-appendix-refs field-type-text field-label-above"><div class="field-label">References:&nbsp;</div><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><a class="anchor" name="reference-1"></a><p>[1] Berkay Kaplan and Jingyu Qian.

Today, however, C's long-standing dominance is being challenged by Rust<a href="#reference-1">[1]</a>, a modern system programming language that promises speed, safety, and productivity. Rust is fundamentally different from C in ways that provide OS researchers and developers with new tools and perspectives for addressing long-standing challenges such as kernel memory safety. This shift invites us to revisit the traditional wisdom established during the C era.</p>  <p data-endline="7" data-position="714" data-size="0" data-startline="7">This mindset led us to ask a series of questions: <em data-position="764" data-size="0">What is the ideal architecture for Rust-based OSes?

This global incident—now known as the CrowdStrike outage<a href="#reference-5">[5]</a>—was caused by a memory safety bug in a Windows driver: an out-of-bounds memory access. This incident serves as a sobering reminder that even mature, commercial OSes like Windows and Linux remain vulnerable to memory safety flaws. Studies estimate that 60–70% of critical security vulnerabilities in C-based system software, including Linux, stem from memory safety bugs<a href="#reference-6">[6]</a><a href="#reference-7">[7]</a>.</p>  <p data-endline="17" data-position="2248" data-size="0" data-startline="17">As Rust has matured and gained popularity, Rust-based OSes have attracted growing attention. Rust provides memory safety guarantees through innovative features such as ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes, enabling safe memory management without garbage collection. Many now regard Rust as a leading candidate to succeed C and C++ as the dominant systems programming language. The Rust for Linux (RFL) project<a href="#reference-8">[8]</a> has been integrated into Linux to facilitate writing "leaf" kernel modules in Rust. New OS kernels like Tock<a href="#reference-9">[9]</a>, RedLeaf<a href="#reference-10">[10]</a>, and Theseus<a href="#reference-11">[11]</a> are built from the ground up using Rust.</p>  <p data-endline="19" data-position="2854" data-size="0" data-startline="19">While adopting Rust is a significant step toward kernel memory safety, it is not sufficient on its own, because Rust-based OSes must include <code data-position="2996" data-size="6">unsafe</code> Rust code. The Rust type system, although powerful and expressive, cannot determine whether low-level, machine-oriented operations in kernel programming—such as accessing CPU registers, manipulating page tables, or writing to physical memory—are safe, unless explicitly marked so by the programmer with the <code data-position="3312" data-size="6">unsafe</code> keyword. It is the programmer's responsibility to use the <code data-position="3379" data-size="6">unsafe</code> keyword correctly and discreetly; failing to do so can lead to undefined behaviors (UBs) and undermine Rust’s memory safety guarantees. Despite the Rust team authoring the Rustonomicon<a href="#reference-12">[12]</a>, a book dedicated to the “dark arts” of unsafe Rust, developers remain prone to misusing <code data-position="3677" data-size="6">unsafe</code>, as evidenced by hundreds of related bugs recorded in the RustSec Advisory Database<a href="#reference-13">[13]</a>.</p>  <p data-endline="21" data-position="3781" data-size="0" data-startline="21">Rust kernel developers generally view <code data-position="3820" data-size="6">unsafe</code> as a “necessary evil”, though the extent of its necessity is open to debate.

A significant portion of RFL is devoted to unsafe Rust code that interacts with the legacy C APIs. As RFL expands to cover more subsystems and their C APIs, codebase will grow to hundreds of thousands of lines.

Using these APIs, the de-privileged OS services can implement all high-level OS functionality, e.g., process management, task scheduling, file systems, network stacks, and device drivers.</p>  <p data-endline="50" data-position="8205" data-size="0" data-startline="50">This <em data-position="8210" data-size="0">language-based, intra-kernel privilege separation</em> means that memory safety depends solely on the correctness of the privileged OS framework—a small TCB comparable to a microkernel. Meanwhile, different OS components can communicate through efficient mechanisms—such as function calls and shared memory—a hallmark of monolithic kernels. In this sense, the framekernel architecture combines the performance of a monolithic kernel with the security benefits of a microkernel, making it an ideal architecture for memory-safe OSes in Rust.</p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item even"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-article-image paragraphs-item-article-image paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-9181" id="article-image-9181">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-article-image field-type-image field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><img src="https://www.usenix.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_embedded/public/pasted_image_20250615162136.png" width="1440" height="670" alt="" /></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-article-image-caption field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Figure 1.

We named it OSTD to reflect our goal of making it Rust’s (unofficial) standard library for OS development. It is publicly available on crates.io<a href="#reference-18">[18]</a>. OSTD offers a small set of powerful abstractions, whose safe APIs are used by <em data-position="9338" data-size="0">OSTD clients</em>—safe kernel components that build on top of OSTD. These APIs are expressive enough to meet the three primary needs of safe OS development: (1) safe user-kernel interactions, (2) safe kernel logic, and (3) safe kernel-peripheral interactions.</p>  <p data-endline="59" data-position="9596" data-size="0" data-startline="59">To illustrate how OSTD enables safe OS development, consider a minimal “Hello World” framekernel built around a basic system call loop, as shown by the figure below.</p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item even"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-article-image paragraphs-item-article-image paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-9183" id="article-image-9183">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-article-image field-type-image field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><img src="https://www.usenix.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_embedded/public/pasted_image_20250523161921.png" width="1440" height="763" alt="" /></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-article-image-caption field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Figure 2.

Each of these abstractions encapsulates underlying unsafe Rust code behind well-defined, safe APIs. With OSTD, developing a Rust kernel can be done as safely as doing Rust applications. For a fully working example, check out our sample project "Write a Hello World kernel in around 100 lines of safe Rust"<a href="#reference-19">[19]</a>.</p>  <p data-endline="66" data-position="10668" data-size="0" data-startline="66">One key design goal of OSTD is <em data-position="10699" data-size="0">soundness</em>, i.e., the absence of undefined behaviors (UBs). UBs are operations that compromise Rust's correctness and safety guarantees. The Rust Reference book enumerates common UBs<a href="#reference-20">[20]</a>, e.g., data races, memory access based on dangling or misaligned pointers, out-of-bound memory access, violations of the pointer aliasing rules, and mutation of immutable memory. In kernel space, UBs may also arise from the kernel’s control over its own execution environment—when the code, stack, or heap is corrupted. UBs can also originate at the hardware level, due to incorrect usage of CPU features or peripheral devices—for instance, misconfigured page tables, improperly saved CPU registers, or memory corruption caused by unchecked DMA.</p>  <p data-endline="68" data-position="11446" data-size="0" data-startline="68">Achieving soundness is challenging because OSTD has to do so despite buggy safe clients, malicious user programs, or faulty peripheral devices. To ensure soundness, we utilize a combination of software-based (e.g., Rust's type system) and hardware-based (e.g., MMU and IOMMU) protections to enforce a set of key safety invariants. We also extend Miri<a href="#reference-21">[21]</a>, Rust’s official UB detection tool, to systematically identify potential safety issues within OSTD. See our ATC’25 paper for technical details.</p>  <p data-endline="70" data-position="11948" data-size="0" data-startline="70">One ongoing effort is to formally verify critical unsafe components in OSTD (e.g., page tables) using Verus<a href="#reference-22">[22]</a>.

It includes support for multiple file systems (e.g., Ext2, exFAT32, OverlayFS, RamFS, ProcFS, and SysFS), socket types (e.g., TCP, UDP, Unix, and Netlink), and devices (e.g., Virtio Block, Virtio Network, Virtio Vsock, USB controllers, and USB HID). Two CPU architectures are supported: x86-64 (tier-1) and RISC-V (tier-2). All of this functionality is implemented in safe Rust using OSTD’s APIs. Asterinas has been under active development for three years. The combined repositories of Asterinas and OSTD are open source<a href="#reference-4">[4]</a> and now contain over 100K lines of Rust, contributed by more than 50 individuals<a href="#reference-24">[24]</a>.</p>  <p data-endline="81" data-position="13392" data-size="0" data-startline="81">To minimize the TCB, Asterinas—rather than OSTD—implements much of the OS infrastructure traditionally considered part of Linux’s core, leveraging the privilege boundary defined by the framekernel design. For instance, Asterinas manages all interrupt bottom halves, such as softirq, tasklets, and work queues, by using an interrupt handling hook provided by OSTD. OSTD enforces “atomic mode” to prevent client-provided callbacks from sleeping in interrupt context. Asterinas also manages system time, monotonic time, and wall clocks by registering timer interrupts and reading the timestamp counter (TSC) via OSTD.</p>  <p data-endline="83" data-position="14008" data-size="0" data-startline="83">We conducted a thorough evaluation of Asterinas and OSTD. Asterinas delivers performance on par with Linux. On LMbench, a syscall-intensive microbenchmark, it achieves a mean normalized performance score of 1.08 (relative to Linux; higher is better). For three I/O-intensive applications—Nginx, Redis, and SQLite—it delivers normalized scores of 1.17, 1.31, and 0.85, respectively. The framekernel design also yields a lean TCB: Asterinas’s TCB accounts for just 14.0% of its codebase, versus 43.8% in Tock, 62.4% in Theseus, and 66.1% in RedLeaf. These results highlight the practicality and benefits of the framekernel architecture.</p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item odd"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-9188" id="single-column-text-9188">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Conclusion and future work</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p data-endline="87" data-position="14675" data-size="0" data-startline="87">This article presents Asterinas, a Linux ABI-compatible OS kernel based on the novel framekernel architecture.

Entire categories of bugs that used to plague systems programmers—like use-after-free, data races, and segmentation faults—have begun to completely disappear. The secret to this new reality is a set of systems programming languages chief among them Rust—whose powerful type systems are able to constructively eliminate these kind of bugs; if it compiles, then it’s correct … or at least, will not contain use-after-free or other memory safety errors. These languages are gaining widespread adoption across industry [<a href="#reference-1">1</a>, <a href="#reference-2">2</a>, <a href="#reference-3">3</a>] and academia [<a href="#reference-4">4</a>, <a href="#reference-5">5</a>, <a href="#reference-6">6</a>, <a href="#reference-7">7</a>] alike, and are adopted for ambitious and critical systems, such as new high-performance compute libraries, distributed storage systems, and operating systems.</p>  <p>Despite these successes, the reality is a little more complicated. There is a great amount of software already written in other languages. And often, external constraints such as certification requirements or developer expertise force even new components to be written in other, less safe languages. Therefore, an important feature for any new systems programming language is its ability to easily and efficiently interact with existing foreign libraries. Developers building new systems can leverage existing native cryptography, mathematics, graphical, and other libraries immediately, without waiting for them to first be ported to new languages and without suffering a performance hit. They can incrementally migrate existing systems, replacing components in a legacy C/C++ codebase with safe alternatives <a href="#reference-1">[1]</a>.</p>  <p>Unfortunately, interacting with foreign code can result in subtle, but nonetheless devastating safety violations that re-introduce the very concerns many developers are trying to avoid by using type-safe languages. For example, foreign libraries may themselves include memory safety vulnerabilities, such as OpenSSL’s infamous Heartbleed bug <a href="#reference-8">[8]</a>. When foreign code is invoked through a Foreign Function Interface (FFI), it runs in the same address space and with the same privileges as the host language. Therefore, vulnerabilities in native libraries can affect the entire host program and break memory or type safety guarantees.</p>  <p>While we are quick to reach for tools like process isolation, a system call boundary, or a client-server model to solve this, these tools often only help uphold memory safety, which is only half the battle. Each language has specific invariants over its types (like permissible values) which its compiler relies on when producing code. Ensuring that all types are correctly inhabited goes beyond memory safety; it requires type safety. In fact, memory and type safety are intertwined: a violation of one can easily break the other. And finally, some program invariants—like whether references can be aliased—require reasoning about both type and memory safety. Interactions with untrusted code or between different languages that violate these invariants can lead to undefined behavior and, in turn, break other safety properties.</p>  <p>We present Omniglot <a href="#reference-9">[9]</a>, a new approach and framework we have developed that can maintain both memory and type safety across interactions with untrusted foreign libraries, in different settings: we implement prototypes for Linux userspace applications and a Rust-based kernel. In this article, we want to focus on illustrating the fundamental link between memory and type safety through an example of interacting with a foreign library and provide an intuition on how the Omniglot framework works.</p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item even"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-9165" id="single-column-text-9165">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Breaking Memory Safety with Invalid Values</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p>Before we can discuss how Omniglot enables safe interactions with foreign languages, we need to understand the types of invariants that programming languages require developers to uphold, and why conventional solutions such as memory isolation are insufficient. In this section, we use a simple example to illustrate how breaking one of Rust’s invariants—that of valid values—can in turn violate a range of other safety properties (including memory safety) and break conventional isolation techniques.</p>  <p>In Listing 1 we show an example of a C function and type definition, and corresponding bindings for this type and function signature in Rust. We define a C enum <code>async_res_t</code> to signal the completion state of an asynchronous operation. In Rust, we define a corresponding type <code>enum AsyncRes</code> with identical variants. Annotating this type with <code>#[repr(C)]</code> ensures that the enum will have an identical representation to its C counterpart. Finally, we define a function <code>async_print</code> in C, and declare a corresponding foreign function binding in Rust.</p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item odd"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-article-image paragraphs-item-article-image paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-9163" id="article-image-9163">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-article-image field-type-image field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><img src="https://www.usenix.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_embedded/public/omniglot-listing-1_1.png" width="1440" height="535" alt="" /></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-article-image-caption field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Listing 1: Rust bindings for a C enum type async_res_t and C function definition async_print.</div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item even"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-9166" id="single-column-text-9166">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p>Immediately, there is one oddity: the stubbed out <code>async_print</code> returns a value produced by <code>rand()</code>—<em>any</em> integer value—while our enum only has 3 variants. Surprisingly, this is valid C, as its enums are merely named integer constants. The rest of the code, meanwhile, seems solid: the <code>async_res_t</code> enum type has a one-to-one mapping from its C to Rust representation, and the <code>async_print</code> function binding accurately reflects the C function’s signature.</p>  <p>Unfortunately, these bindings are nonetheless subtly incorrect and can lead to safety issues down the line. This is because C’s enums work differently from Rust’s enum types: while in C enums are merely named integer constants, in Rust an enum type declaration creates a new type which is limited to a fixed set of values. This means that, while it is legal in C for an enum type to assume values that do not correspond to a declared variant of this enum, this is considered undefined behavior in Rust <a href="#reference-10">[10]</a>. And interpreting the result of <code>rand()</code> as a value of the <code>enum AsyncRes</code> type may well produce such an invalid variant.</p>  <p>Meanwhile, avoiding undefined behavior is a worthwhile goal: Rust’s unsafe code guidelines state rather bluntly that, in the presence of undefined behavior, “the program produced by the compiler is essentially garbage” <a href="#reference-11">[11]</a>. In fact, by extending the above example slightly, we can see how this violation of Rust’s restriction on valid values can result in a range of other safety issues. For this, consider the wrapper around the <code>async_print</code> foreign function of Listing 2.</p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item odd"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-article-image paragraphs-item-article-image paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-9164" id="article-image-9164">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-article-image field-type-image field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><img src="https://www.usenix.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_embedded/public/omniglot-listing-2_1.png" width="1440" height="871" alt="" /></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-article-image-caption field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Listing 2: A wrapper around the FFI bindings from Listing 1.

This outer enum has two variants: it represents the result of an asynchronously printed a byte array, or synchronously printed null-terminated <code>CString</code> value.</p>  <p>Again, the snippet above seems unproblematic at first. Unfortunately, when paired with the violation of Rust’s invariants on valid values above, it will perform an out-of-bounds memory access. This is due to an optimization called niche filling. When considering the underlying memory representation of the <code>enum PrintResult</code> type (assuming a 32 bit system), it holds the following components:</p>  <ul> 	<li>a discriminant value indicating the enum’s active variant (4 bytes),</li> 	<li>in case of <code>PrintResult::Async</code> being active, the <code>enum AsyncRes</code> value and a <code>&amp;[u8]</code> slice pointer and length (12 bytes),</li> 	<li>and, in case of <code>PrintResult::Sync</code> being active, a pointer to a null-terminated <code>CString</code> allocated on the heap (4 bytes).</li> </ul>  <p>This means that the size of the PrintResult type should be 16 bytes. However, Rust knows that the only values an enum AsyncRes can assume are <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, or <code>2</code>. Therefore, it can combine this field together with the outer enum’s discriminant value and reduce the overall size of this type to 12 bytes.</p>  <p>Yet, when we break the assumption that the <code>AsyncRes</code> type will only contain values from <code>0</code> to <code>2</code>, the above optimization can cause the program to misbehave: for instance, assuming the call to <code>rand()</code> within the <code>async_print</code> function returned <code>3</code>, then Rust would store this value as the <code>PrintResult</code> type’s discriminant. However, reading this value back, it would incorrectly assume that the <code>PrintResult::Sync</code> variant is active, and interpret the stored slice pointer as a pointer to a null-terminated C string, potentially reading other out-of-bounds data or experiencing a segmentation fault.</p>  <p>Notably, many existing approaches to safely interact with foreign or untrusted libraries would not prevent the above soundness violation: the out-of-bounds memory accesses occur from within the Rust domain itself! Even if a foreign library was prevented from accessing any of Rust’s memory, the soundness violation could still occur. This is a violation of type safety, which has escalated to a violation of memory safety.</p>  <p>Next to valid values there are many more safety-critical invariants that Rust requires a developer to uphold: for instance, a defining feature of Rust is its concept of aliasing XOR mutability, which disallows any aliased references from being mutated. Similar to the invariants around valid values, these safety properties are difficult to reason about and maintain across complex interactions with foreign code. Thus, instead of considering all individual invariants at any point where Rust interacts with foreign code, we need a systematic approach to reason and maintain them.</p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item odd"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-9168" id="single-column-text-9168">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">The Omniglot Approach</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p>When looking at the above example, the fundamental error—leading to the subsequent soundness violations and memory safety issues—was that we trusted the proclaimed type of the C function signature. And while, in this particular case, the fault lies within the bindings failing to accurately model the differences between C’s and Rust’s respective enum types (the appropriate type on Rust’s side would have been a <code>c_int</code>), these issues are commonplace: for instance, even types as simple as booleans have different (or missing) definitions depending on the C standard used. And beyond that, there are few guarantees that a given foreign library is itself correct and adheres to all of its language’s requirements.</p>  <p>Conventionally, developers using Rust’s native, unsafe FFI will need to reason about the entire program and ensure that any Rust code, foreign code, and their composition is sound. While the Rust compiler validates soundness of safe Rust code, it cannot do so for interactions with foreign code. Omniglot does not model the entire program, and takes a different approach: instead of statically reasoning about the behavior of foreign code, it reduces the assumptions that Rust places on it, and employs runtime validations to ensure that any cross-language interactions do not break Rust’s invariants. In this article, we want to provide an intuition for how this approach captures the soundness violations of the above example. Omniglot combines this method with other mechanisms to enable safe interactions with entirely untrusted foreign libraries; we encourage reading the paper for more details <a href="#reference-9">[9]</a>.</p>  <p>We illustrate Omniglot’s approach in Figure 1: our goal is to provide a foreign function binding for the <code>async_print</code> function, returning an instance of the <code>enum AsyncRes</code> Rust type, but without the potential soundness violations shown in the previous sections. In this setting, we cannot prevent the C function from returning a value not part of its async_res_t enum definition. However, when this happens, it should result in an explicit error indicating that the C library violated its API contract, instead of introducing undefined behavior in the Rust host program.</p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item even"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-article-image paragraphs-item-article-image paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-9169" id="article-image-9169">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-article-image field-type-image field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><img src="https://www.usenix.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_embedded/public/omniglot-figure-1.png" width="1440" height="945" alt="" /></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-article-image-caption field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Figure 1: Omniglot interposes on interactions between Rust and foreign code.

These bindings—together with an Omniglot runtime library—internally invoke the foreign functions, surrounded by a range of runtime and static checks that catch and prevent potential violations of Rust’s invariants before they can manifest in undefined behavior.</p>  <p>For the issue of valid values in particular, it uses a trick: instead of declaring the foreign function’s signature faithfully—with the exact types that a developer would want to use—it declares another function symbol (<code>fn async_print'</code>) with a different, more permissive set of types. These types have the same size and layout constraints as their original counterparts, but carry fewer invariants that could be violated by foreign code. For instance, instead of representing C’s <code>async_res_t</code> enum using the Rust <code>enum AsyncRes</code> type, we can represent it using a simple C integer (<code>c_int</code>). This type has identical size and alignment to that of the <code>enum AsyncRes</code>, but any bit-pattern represents a valid value of this type. This prevents foreign code from violating Rust’s invariants by returning unexpected values.</p>  <p>Finally, the wrapper inspects and validates values returned by foreign code. If it corresponds to a valid value of the original return type, it converts the weaker <code>c_int</code> type back into an <code>enum AsyncRes</code>. And if it does not correspond to any <code>AsyncRes</code> variant, instead of introducing undefined behavior, the wrapper returns an error indicating that foreign code returned an unexpected value.</p>  <p>In addition to validating types, Omniglot also addresses Rust’s invariants around memory safety and aliasing. For instance, it integrates with a memory isolation primitive (such as x86′s Memory Protection Keys or the RISC-V Physical Memory Protection unit) to prevent buggy or malicious foreign libraries from writing to any of Rust’s memory. And because Rust’s borrow checker cannot reason about pointers passed through foreign code, we introduce a mechanism that upholds Rust’s aliasing restrictions by statically reasoning about when references are allowed to read from or write to foreign memory. We explain these mechanisms in more detail in our paper <a href="#reference-9">[9]</a>.</p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item even"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-9171" id="single-column-text-9171">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Conclusion</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p>Using the above approach, alongside other mechanisms that are responsible for maintaining Rust’s invariants around memory safety and aliasing, Omniglot can provide developers with a safe API to interact with foreign libraries that is similar to Rust’s native, unsafe FFI, without having to reason about the entire program.</p>  <p>In our paper, we evaluate Omniglot for use in both Linux userspace applications (making use of x86 Memory Protection Keys to isolate foreign libraries’ memory), and for resource constrained embedded systems by integrating it into the Tock embedded OS kernel. We show that Omniglot works for a range of libraries libraries such as cryptography, compression, image decoding, file system and TCP/ IP networking.</p>  <p>While Omniglot does introduce some runtime overhead, we find that it performs comparably to existing memory isolation based approaches while delivering a stronger set of safety guarantees (adding 0% to 3.4% in overheads across our benchmarks). In addition, Omniglot can perform significantly better compared to previous approaches that utilize Inter-Process Communication (IPC) and serialization to exchange data to interact with untrusted components.</p>  <p>We will publish our research prototype of Omniglot in the coming weeks and will update this article once it becomes available.</p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div></div></div><legend><span class="fieldset-legend">Appendix</span></legend><div class="fieldset-wrapper"><div class="field field-name-field-lvl2-appendix-refs field-type-text field-label-above"><div class="field-label">References:&nbsp;</div><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><a class="anchor" name="reference-1"></a><p>[1] T.

Open vSwitch is also open source, another important aspect to OvS' success. Clouds include racks of servers, with each server running many virtual machines, and implementing software-based network switches are crucial for the use and management of the vast numbers of VMs.</p>  <p>The paper on the Design and Implementation of Open vSwitch won the Best Paper award at NSDI'15, and I had actually asked the paper's authors before<br /> the conference to write an article about OvS. I think I was intrigued with the notion of software defined networks (SDN), as well as being impressed that this was an open source project.</p>  <p>Rik Farrow: Based on bios in the 2015 article in ;login: [2] about OvS, it sounds like the software was started by a group out of Stanford that formed a company called Nicira. And that's how software later taken over by VMware remained open source. Could you explain a bit of the history<br /> of OvS?</p>  <p>Ben Pfaff: That's right, Nicira was founded by Nick McKeown and Martin Casado from Stanford, and Scott Shenker from Berkeley, as an extension of their research into flow-based networking, the SANE [3] and Ethane [4] papers in particular.</p>  <p>OvS being open source was essential. Nicira's mission was to sell better, software-based networking to companies making use of virtualization software. That could only work if Nicira's controller products had something to control, and Open vSwitch enabled that control. To allow Nicira's software to be as useful as possible, and therefore to maximize sales potential, it made sense for Open vSwitch to run in as many environments as possible. Open vSwitch as open source allowed it to be ported and extended widely, and since it was useful for many things beyond running Nicira's controller, that actually happened.</p>  <p>The userspace and kernel portions of Open vSwitch were fairly well separated. While the kernel portion obviously must be open source, it would have been practical to make the userspace portion closed source. We made it open and kept it open because it was to our advantage to do so. And I am a long-time personal proponent of free and open source software as well.</p>  <p>There are, and were, other virtual switches. Open vSwitch filled a niche that the others did not: it was fast, it was portable, it was flexible, and it was designed to be controlled remotely. We wrote about some of this at the time in a document titled "Why Open vSwitch?" that is still in the Open vSwitch repository:<br /> <a href="https://github.com/openvswitch/ovs/blob/main/Documentation/intro/why-ovs.rst">https://github.com/openvswitch/ovs/blob/main/Documentation/intro/why-ovs...</a>. For all these reasons, and because we worked hard to integrate outside feedback and contributions, it fit well into many other projects.</p>  <p>RF: Speaking of your commitment to open source, you have worked on a number of other open source projects over the years. Can you speak about your experience working on these? Were there ones you particularly liked? What stuck in my mind was the small graphics module.</p>  <p>BP: Free and open source software is where I started. As a teenager, I got involved in contributing to the GNU project and to Debian GNU/Linux. I was a Debian developer for over 20 years, with my biggest contributions around packaging GNU Autoconf. Besides Open vSwitch, my longest-running project is GNU PSPP (see <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/pspp/">https://www.gnu.org/software/pspp/</a>), a clone of the SPSS statistical software package from IBM, which I started writing in 1996 and still work on. Currently I'm rewriting it in Rust. I think that the graphics library you're talking about is BOGL, which was a quick hack I built in the late 1990s to help with the Debian installer. You might also be thinking of one of my Linux kernel contributions that happened at the same time: I contributed the 16-color VGA framebuffer driver, which allowed ordinary PCs at the time to support simple graphics on text consoles.</p>  <p>RF: That you have created and continue to work on PSPP is impressive. The duty of continuing to support an open source package just seems daunting to me. I interviewed Arnold Robbins [5], that author and maintainer of gawk, and his main complaint was about getting requests for features that if he added them, he would need to continue to support them, even if that feature would rarely be used.</p>  <p>BP: Supporting open source<em> is </em>hard. I have had some of the same experiences as you say Arnold did. We often had users asking for particular features. Since VMware, our employer, made a controller (NVP, later renamed NSX) that used Open vSwitch, the loudest requests often came from those users inside VMware, and those were often the users that were hardest to refuse. On the Open vSwitch team, we knew that we would have to explain and justify those features to everyone, not just VMware employees, and document and maintain them. This led us to push back against the ones that wouldn't be useful outside of whatever NSX wanted at the time. I'm really glad that we did that most of the time, because in some of the cases where we didn't, Open vSwitch ended up with orphan features that no one used—maybe not even NSX, since it turns out that more generally useful features were also more generally useful for NSX, too.</p>  <p>Sometime, contributors outside VMware would contribute not just a feature but all of the code for it, too. That's really good from one point of view, but it doesn't solve the problem of maintenance. You don't want to get thousands of lines of code you don't know well dumped on you to maintain. So we had some high reviewing standards for big contributions like that, and we also tried to get an idea of whether the contributors were likely to stick around to maintain their own code. There was also the question of how entangled the new contribution was with the existing code. Some contributions change existing code in all kinds of intimate ways, so that they would be hard to remove or maintain later; we were pickier about accepting those.</p>  <p>I'm convinced that Rust is the future of a lot of programming; certainly, of a lot of my programming. It is a little harder to write code in Rust, but once you've done it, that code is going to be a lot more likely to work properly, and the kinds of failures you get are less catastrophic. It's simply beautiful that I don't see segmentation faults or bus errors anymore, since Rust eliminates those. And Rust makes it safe to write multithreaded code, which was always a minefield before.</p>  <p>Writing PSPP has been gratifying. I know that PSPP is important to a number of users, although I don't know how many users that is. A few times I've run into people in real life for whom it's been a big deal. Most notably, when I was sitting in a cafe in Sarajevo many years ago, someone bicycled through heavy rain just to say "thank you" to me for PSPP, which I found moving.</p>  <p>PSPP is almost the opposite of Open vSwitch in terms of contributors. Open vSwitch has very technical users, mostly using Linux, a fair fraction of whom can contribute back or at least do a good job of diagnosing and reporting problems. It seems that most PSPP users, though, are running on Windows (an operating system that I do not use) and sometimes can't say much more than "it crashed". Since PSPP is complicated and written in C and includes a graphical user interface, it does crash more than I'd like, and I often can't find out why. One of the motivations for the rewrite in Rust is to eliminate this class of error. I want my users to be able to rely on my software.</p>  <p>RF: I've often wondered: was it better to have an expert statistician write a statistics program, or an expert programmer who knew little about statistics.  When you wrote PSPP, how much did you know about statistics?</p>  <p>BP: My knowledge of statistics was and is still somewhat basic. There is more than enough work of both kinds in PSPP for statisticians and programmers to share. When statisticians have contributed to PSPP, they've needed help from programmers; sometimes when I contribute to PSPP, I've needed help from statisticians. I feel like programmers do have an advantage in your comparison, because they can gain confidence by comparing PSPP results against SPSS results for the same task, whereas statisticians must simply learn programming.</p>  <p>RF: Let's tackle your current project, Feldera. Could you explain the concept behind this? Is this done via static analysis or dynamically?</p>  <p>BP: Feldera is about incremental computing, which comes up when you've got a SQL query that you want to compute over and over again over a lot of data that changes in small ways. It makes sense that it would be cheaper to update the result of your query based on the changes, instead of recalculating the whole query. This is called <em>incremental view maintenance</em> and some databases have been able to do it for some queries for a long time. What Feldera brings in is that we can update the results of any SQL query for any change to a database. That's what the paper that my co-founders published in VLDB in 2023 [6] explained. That paper described a static, mechanical way to transform a database query into an incremental form, producing a new query that works in terms of changes: it takes a stream of insertions and deletions as its input and produces a stream of insertions and deletions as its output as well.</p>  <p>RF: In ML, particularly LLMs, there are lots of matrix operations, and one of the things I've been trying to understand is what happens during pre-training of an LLM when a token is input: does ingesting this token affect every cell in every matrix in the model, or just related ones? If the former, I can imagine that Feldera would save immense amounts of work.</p>  <p>BP: Feldera does not directly help with the matrix algebra parts of machine learning. Incremental computation makes sense when, each time the input to a computation changes, only a small part of the output changes. I think that, in machine learning training, each step changes all of the cells in the matrices (even if only a little), so it's not obvious to me that that part of ML is an application for incremental computing.</p>  <p>But Feldera is a good fit for feature engineering, that is, for figuring out what data to feed into a ML model for training and execution. In real-time ML pipelines, it's necessary to calculate the features to feed into the model in real time as well. Before Feldera, the main choices for computing them that quickly were either to precompute them periodically, which limits how up-to-date they can be and sacrifices accuracy, or to use a streaming system to compute them. The latter limits the kinds of SQL that one can use. Feldera, on the other hand, supports all kinds of computations with SQL, which frees up ML teams to use more sophisticated features that can make their models more accurate.</p>  <p>My co-founder Leonid wrote blog entries on this topic last year: <a href="https://www.feldera.com/blog/feature-engineering-part1">https://www.feldera.com/blog/feature-engineering-part1</a> and <a href="https://www.feldera.com/blog/feature-engineering-part2">https://www.feldera.com/blog/feature-engineering-part2</a>.</p>  <p> </p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div></div></div><legend><span class="fieldset-legend">Appendix</span></legend><div class="fieldset-wrapper"><div class="field field-name-field-lvl2-appendix-refs field-type-text field-label-above"><div class="field-label">References:&nbsp;</div><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><a class="anchor" name="reference-1"></a><p>[1] Pfaff, B., Pettit, J., Koponen, T., Jackson, E.

In the past, a scanned receipt or a photo of a damaged Amazon delivery could serve as solid proof to get claims processed. Today, advancements in sophisticated AI models, such as Google's Gemini 2.0 and Imagen 3, alongside platforms like Midjourney, DALL-E 3, Stable Diffusion, and Flux, have dramatically increased the accessibility, speed, and realism of AI image creation, enabling a surge of convincing forgeries and raising urgent concerns for privacy, security, and societal trust.</p>  <p>As OpenAI noted upon releasing GPT-4o's image generation capabilities in March 2025, they deliberately built their "most advanced image generator yet" to make image creation a primary capability of their AI system [1].</p>  <p>In this article, we'll explore:</p>  <ul> 	<li>The democratization of AI image generation technologies that have made creating realistic fake images accessible to nearly anyone</li> 	<li>Real-world examples showing how these technologies are being exploited for privacy violations, financial fraud, and the spread of misinformation</li> 	<li>Practical techniques to help you identify potentially manipulated or AI-generated images</li> 	<li>Actionable strategies to protect your personal images and information in this new era</li> 	<li>The emerging technological solutions and policy initiatives being developed to address these challenges</li> </ul> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item even"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-9026" id="single-column-text-9026">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">The Democratization of AI Image Generation</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><h3><strong>Multimodal Breakthroughs</strong></h3>  <p>The past two years have witnessed remarkable advancement in AI image generation. Diffusion models like Stable Diffusion XL (open-sourced in 2023) have substantially elevated photorealism and resolution quality in freely accessible tools [2]. This technological pinnacle arrived with OpenAI's GPT-4o in 2025, which seamlessly integrates sophisticated image generation within a conversational AI interface [3].</p>  <p>Users can generate and modify images through natural conversation with GPT-4o, refining details in real-time and creating intricate, high-resolution compositions on demand. Notably, GPT-4o effectively renders text within images and handles multiple distinct objects in complex scenes, addressing characteristic flaws (such as garbled text or malformed hands) that plagued earlier models [3]. By 2025, AI-generated images have achieved both remarkable realism and precise adherence to user specifications—representing a substantial leap that makes potential forgeries considerably more convincing than those from just 12-24 months prior.</p>  <h3><strong>Free, Fast, and Everywhere</strong></h3>  <p>Equally significant as quality improvements is the dramatic expansion of accessibility. Capabilities once requiring technical expertise or premium subscriptions are now freely available to millions. Open-source image models operate on consumer hardware or through no-cost web applications. When GPT-4o's image generation features were extended to all ChatGPT users (including those on free plans) in 2025, adoption proved explosive—over 130 million people created more than 700 million images during the first week post-launch [4].</p>  <p>This ubiquity enables virtually anyone with internet access to produce sophisticated synthetic images instantaneously, without financial investment or specialized knowledge. While this democratization offers substantial creative benefits, it simultaneously reduces barriers to potential misuse.</p>  <h3><strong>Loosening Guardrails</strong></h3>  <p>Early AI image generation systems (such as OpenAI's 2022-era DALL·E 2) implemented strict prohibitions against creating realistic depictions of public figures or potentially deceptive content. However, GPT-4o's release marked a significant shift as OpenAI "peeled back" certain safeguards [5]. In 2025, the company revised its policies to permit previously-prohibited outputs—GPT-4o now generates images of real public figures (including politicians and celebrities) upon request.</p>  <p>OpenAI characterizes this policy evolution as transitioning from "blanket refusals" toward a more nuanced approach focusing exclusively on genuinely harmful applications. Nevertheless, this relaxation of restrictions—combined with an opt-out rather than opt-in system for public figures—has raised concerns that AI could increasingly facilitate photorealistic deepfakes, potentially enabling mischief and misinformation.</p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item odd"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-9027" id="single-column-text-9027">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Real-World Examples of Misuse</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><h3><b>Fake Damage and False Claims</b></h3>  <p>Insurance companies have traditionally relied on photographic evidence to validate damage claims. However, advanced AI image generation now enables the creation of convincing fraudulent evidence. In one documented case that gained viral attention, a user demonstrated (Figure 1) how AI could transform an undamaged car bumper photo by adding realistic "scratches and a small dent" through a simple text prompt [6].</p>  <p>By April 2025, security reports confirmed that individuals were actively exploiting ChatGPT's image generation capabilities to fabricate accident photos and receipts for insurance fraud. What began as creative experimentation rapidly evolved into financial exploitation, prompting one cybersecurity analyst to identify an emerging pattern of "AI-assisted insurance fraud" that presents significant challenges for insurers and financial institutions [7].</p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item even"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-article-image paragraphs-item-article-image paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-9028" id="article-image-9028">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-article-image field-type-image field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><img src="https://www.usenix.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_embedded/public/figure_1_0.png" width="1440" height="1788" alt="" /></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-article-image-caption field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Figure 1: Fake damage to car posted by Instagram page @chatgptricks</div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item odd"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-9029" id="single-column-text-9029">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><h3>AI-Generated Receipts and Documents</h3>  <p>Financial departments face similar vulnerabilities with expense reimbursement processes.

Creating convincing identification documents once required specialized skills; now AI systems can generate realistic ID photos and combine them with stolen personal information to create complete "synthetic identities." By 2024, the U.S. Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) documented increased incidents of deepfake identity fraud, with criminals using AI-generated documents to circumvent Know Your Customer (KYC) verification systems. Even sophisticated biometric verification systems have proven vulnerable, with FinCEN reporting cases where entirely synthetic AI-generated faces successfully passed live verification checks [10].</p>  <p>This same technology that enables convincing identity forgery also powers the spread of viral misinformation. The potential for widespread impact was first demonstrated in March 2023 when an AI-created image of Pope Francis wearing a stylish Balenciaga puffer coat went viral across social platforms. Many viewers, including some journalists, initially believed the image was authentic, with cultural commentators later describing it as "the first real mass-level AI misinformation case" [11].</p>  <p>In January 2025, amid California's devastating wildfires, a series of AI‑fabricated images depicting the Hollywood Sign engulfed in flames circulated widely on platforms like X and Instagram. So convincing were these hoaxes that authorities had to publicly reassure residents that the landmark remained unscathed—even as nearby blazes were contained [12].</p>  <p>The common thread connecting fake IDs and viral hoaxes is the erosion of visual credibility. Whether manipulating personal identities or public perceptions, AI-generated images exploit our inherent trust in what we see, creating cascading effects that range from financial fraud to public panic and institutional distrust.</p>  <p> </p>  <p> </p>  <p> </p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item even"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-9032" id="single-column-text-9032">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Digital Self-Defense: Detecting Fakes and Protecting Your Privacy</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p>As AI-generated images become increasingly sophisticated, individuals need a comprehensive approach to both identify synthetic content and protect their personal digital presence.</p>  <h3>Recognizing AI-Generated Images</h3>  <p>Despite technological advances, several indicators can help identify potential fakes:</p>  <ul> 	<li>Anatomical inconsistencies: Look for irregularities in hands, fingers, and facial features—AI still struggles with complex anatomical details</li> 	<li>Lighting and shadow discrepancies: Check whether shadows align logically with light sources</li> 	<li>Background anomalies: Examine backgrounds for blurriness, simplicity, or contextually inappropriate elements</li> 	<li>Text irregularities: Scrutinize in-image text for gibberish, spelling errors, or inconsistent fonts—a reliable indicator of synthetic media</li> 	<li>Unnatural perfection: Be wary of flawless skin textures or unnaturally symmetric features lacking the imperfections found in genuine photos</li> 	<li>Digital artifacts: Look for small glitches or color inconsistencies at object boundaries</li> </ul>  <p>Reverse image search can help determine if an image has appeared elsewhere online. However, even technical detection methods are losing effectiveness—research by Chandra et al. (2025) found detection accuracy dropped by 45-50% against the latest AI-generated images [13].</p>  <h3>Safeguarding Your Digital Identity</h3>  <p>Protecting your personal images requires a proactive, multi-layered approach:</p>  <ul> 	<li>Audit your digital footprint: Regularly use reverse image search to locate where your photos appear across the web</li> 	<li>Implement strategic privacy settings: Configure granular controls on social platforms while recognizing their limitations—a Consumer Reports investigation found 62% of platforms retained images for AI training despite maximized privacy settings</li> 	<li>Practice data minimization: Before posting, the Electronic Frontier Foundation recommends asking: "Is this image necessary? Who might access it? What's the worst-case scenario if misused?"</li> 	<li>Deploy technical protections: Use visible watermarks on important images, explore adversarial tools like Glaze that confuse AI systems without affecting human viewing, and strip metadata containing sensitive information</li> 	<li>Monitor for unauthorized use: Set up alerts for your name and images using Google Alerts or specialized services like PimEyes</li> 	<li>Exercise your legal rights: Use GDPR's "right to be forgotten" in the EU or state-specific protections in the US, documenting thoroughly if you discover misuse</li> 	<li>Consider protection services: For high-risk individuals, digital identity protection services can provide comprehensive monitoring</li> </ul> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item odd"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-9033" id="single-column-text-9033">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">The Role of Technology and Policy</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><h3><b>Combating AI Image Misuse</b></h3>  <p>The technological community is developing multiple approaches to address AI-generated image misuse. Detection algorithms analyze distinctive patterns not found in authentic photographs. While promising, these tools face challenges as generation techniques evolve, creating an ongoing "arms race" between detection and creation technologies. According to Deloitte Insights, the market for deepfake detection technology is projected to grow from $5.5 billion in 2023 to $15.7 billion by 2026, reflecting the urgency of this challenge [14].</p>  <p>Watermarking has emerged as another key strategy, ranging from visible labels to imperceptible embedded patterns detectable by specialized software. Content provenance initiatives like the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) are developing open standards to verify media authenticity throughout its lifecycle [15]. By early 2024, Adobe reported that Content Credentials had been implemented in a "swiftly growing range of platforms and technologies," including cameras, smartphones, and editing software, with Leica releasing the world's first digital camera with built-in Content Credentials support [16]. Most experts agree that effective defense requires combining detection systems, robust watermarking, and comprehensive provenance tracking.</p>  <h3><b>Regulatory Responses: Emerging Frameworks and Their Impact</b></h3>  <p>Global regulatory approaches to AI image generation vary significantly in scope and effectiveness. The EU leads with its comprehensive AI Act, which requires mandatory disclosure of AI-generated content through visible labels and machine-readable marking [17]. Early evidence suggests these measures are having an impact—a 2025 Oxford Internet Institute study found a 34% decrease in unattributed AI-generated content across European platforms since implementation, with major companies like Google and Meta achieving over 90% compliance.</p>  <p>In the United States, regulation has emerged primarily at the state level. By 2025, 21 states had enacted laws addressing deepfakes in elections and non-consensual imagery. California's enforcement has shown particular promise, with legal action in 47 cases and successful prosecutions establishing important precedents for liability. The proposed federal DEEPFAKES Accountability Act aims to establish nationwide protections but remains pending [18].</p>  <p>Despite these advances, significant challenges remain. Cross-border enforcement is particularly problematic—INTERPOL and EUROPOL report that only 12% of identified cross-border AI fraud cases in 2024 led to successful legal action. Technical circumvention also threatens regulatory effectiveness, as demonstrated by University of Maryland researchers who successfully broke all tested AI watermarking systems.</p>  <p>The World Economic Forum projects that enhanced regulation could reduce AI-driven fraud by up to 42% by 2027, suggesting a favorable cost-benefit ratio despite adding 3-7% to business compliance costs. This indicates that while imperfect, regulatory frameworks represent a necessary component of a comprehensive response to AI image misuse.</p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item even"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-9034" id="single-column-text-9034">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Conclusion</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p>The rapid evolution of AI image generation technology has fundamentally altered our relationship with visual information. As these tools become increasingly sophisticated and accessible, we face unprecedented challenges to privacy, security, and trust.</p>  <p>Addressing these challenges requires a coordinated response across multiple fronts. Technology companies must continue developing robust detection algorithms, watermarking solutions, and content provenance standards. Legal frameworks, like the EU AI Act's transparency mandates, provide important guardrails but need broader international harmonization to be truly effective.</p>  <p>For individuals, awareness and proactive protection strategies remain essential first lines of defense. By limiting our digital footprints, using privacy-enhancing tools, and developing critical literacy skills to question suspicious content, we can reduce vulnerability to AI-powered deception.</p>  <p>The democratization of image generation capabilities brings tremendous creative potential but also significant risks. As Global Witness aptly noted, the chaos wrought by unbridled generative AI was not inevitable; it is partly a result of "deploying shiny new products without sufficient transparency or safeguards" [20]. By fostering collaboration between technologists, policymakers, and an informed public, we can build systems that maximize the benefits of these powerful tools while minimizing their potential for harm.</p>  <p> </p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div></div></div><legend><span class="fieldset-legend">Appendix</span></legend><div class="fieldset-wrapper"><div class="field field-name-field-lvl2-appendix-refs field-type-text field-label-above"><div class="field-label">References:&nbsp;</div><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><a class="anchor" name="reference-1"></a><p>[1] OpenAI, "Introducing 4o Image Generation," OpenAI, Mar. 25, 2025.</p> </div><div class="field-item even"><a class="anchor" name="reference-2"></a><p>[2] Odyssey, "The Four Best Locally Run Image Models," Odyssey, 2024.</p> </div><div class="field-item odd"><a class="anchor" name="reference-3"></a><p>[3] VentureBeat, "'Insane': OpenAI introduces GPT-4o native image generation and it's already wowing users," VentureBeat, Mar. 2025.</p> </div><div class="field-item even"><a class="anchor" name="reference-4"></a><p>[4] M.

Of course, we documented as much as possible, and often pointed people to that documentation, but documentation is not the same as helping teams with their specific problems. However, we were always limited in the time that we had to engage with development teams. We used Production Readiness Reviews (PRR) as a method to share our production expertise efficiently with as many development teams as possible.</p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item even"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-8977" id="single-column-text-8977">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Introducing PRRs</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p>A Production Readiness Review is a process which assesses services’ operational capabilities and characteristics. PRRs are typically concerned with areas such as Observability, Reliability, Incident Handling, Scalability, Security, and Disaster Recovery.</p>  <p>I first encountered the term “Production Readiness Review” in the first <a href="https://sre.google/sre-book/evolving-sre-engagement-model/" target="_blank">Site Reliability Engineering book</a>, which describes a PRR as “a process that identifies the reliability needs of a service based on its specific details”. Google SRE teams conducting PRRs consider:</p>  <ul> 	<li>System architecture and interservice dependencies</li> 	<li>Instrumentation, metrics, and monitoring</li> 	<li>Emergency response</li> 	<li>Capacity planning</li> 	<li>Change management</li> 	<li>Performance: availability, latency, and efficiency</li> </ul>  <p>I used a process similar to Google’s PRRs while part of an on-call team which was responsible for incident handling. Services were developed and owned by other teams, so in order to onboard any service to our on-call list, we conducted what we called a 24x7 Handover review. The topics covered in these reviews were very similar to the ones in Google’s PRR process. The on-call team did not work closely with the development team to improve the service’s reliability — but we would still provide feedback and suggestions for how to improve the service.</p>  <p><a href="https://grafana.com/blog/2021/10/13/how-were-building-a-production-readiness-review-process-at-grafana-labs/" target="_blank">Grafana Labs also uses PRRs</a>. The goal of a PRR at Grafana is not for the reviewing team to take on a service, but rather to identify potential production issues, and reduce the “toil and risks that the product might face”. The topics examined during Grafana’s PRRs are essentially the same as those used by Google SRE teams.</p>  <p>All three organisations use a similar process to review a service’s operational capabilities, with the aim of producing more robust and reliable services.</p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item odd"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-8978" id="single-column-text-8978">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Benefits of a PRR</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p>One aspect of the value provided by PRRs is identification of risks and deficits in operational readiness. Identifying and improving in these areas should result in more robust systems. But we found there were additional benefits which derived from running PRRs. PRRs created opportunities to discuss operational topics, and how some practices work together. If we were working together with a team to improve, for example, Observability, we would help teams with identifying signals to monitor, alerting thresholds, and instrumentation. But within the scope of a PRR, we could start with a concrete failure scenario, and from there discuss system architecture, how their instrumentation would help them detect and manage the problem, and how to recover. PRRs helped us to show teams a more complete picture of system robustness.</p>  <p>Performing PRRs helped our SRE team understand whether teams were adopting the recommended practices, how SRE-provided tools were working, whether there were tooling gaps, and if new technologies were emerging that were not covered by the existing tools and practices. It gave us a valuable connection to the experience of the teams that we worked with and their operational capabilities.</p>  <p>This understanding of operational capabilities proved useful for other occasions. As well as using PRRs for launches of new systems, we began to use it to validate the preparation level of services critical for large commercial events. This use of PRRs was largely seen as a success: we would either find some blind spots where teams could improve, or we confirmed that the services were well prepared, which gave development teams and stakeholders added confidence.</p>  <p>When I moved to a new organisation, I found another use for PRRs: they gave me a structured way to assess the operational capabilities of services in my area of responsibility. By running PRRs with every team, I got to know their services, the operational maturity of each team, how different teams within the department were connected, what were the critical services of the department, and which operational aspects could be improved department-wide.</p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item even"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-8979" id="single-column-text-8979">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Performing a PRR</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p>The steps, roles, and responsibilities for a PRR will also change from company to company.

The development team fills out a document with all of the information required from the system under review. After the document is complete, and a number of review sessions are held between both teams, the review team provides a list of risks identified during the review, with an indication of the criticality of each risk.

One of the first questions that development teams usually ask is what should be in the scope of the PRR. Is it one service, or multiple? If it’s multiple, how many should be included? In most cases, the scope of the PRR should be a feature or product. In some cases, looking at services in isolation would be counterproductive, as those services don’t really work in isolation.</p>  <p>Let’s look at an example where a team just wrapped up development of a new product. The team that led the development of the new product requested the PRR ahead of the product’s go-live. The product was built on a microservices architecture. It relies on a few systems owned by other teams (not to mention any platform services). No development was needed from the other teams, as the new product is using only pre-existing features. In this situation, the PRR should ideally focus only on the new services developed for the new product. Dependencies owned by other teams should be out of scope for the PRR, although the client-server relationship will still be a part of it.</p>  <p>A PRR should only rely on a single document, regardless of the number of services included. By using a single PRR document it is easier for the review team to analyse the system as a whole, rather than looking at the individual components separately. This ‘big picture’ view grants the review team the ability to see how all of those new services interact to deliver their intended value, making it easier to spot risks that would be missed by looking at services in isolation. Filling out a single document is also a big help for the development team, because it will be less work for them, as some of the data collected for one service will be the same for some, or all of the others.</p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item odd"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-8984" id="single-column-text-8984">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Creating the review template</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p>Creating the review template can be the biggest challenge in the preparation of the PRR process. It is a balancing act, where template owners need to cater to a broad set of topics to cover, accommodate for different system architectures (RPC, Frontend, Asynchronous, etc), being thorough enough to get all the information required to do a proper review, without going into too many details that would drag out the process and discourage development teams from doing PRRs. Below is a list of concrete topics that a PRR should cover, what to look for with each topic, and some example questions.</p>  <p><strong>Context</strong><br /> Not an operational topic, but relevant to understand the placement of the system being reviewed in the company’s broader system.</p>  <ul> 	<li>What product, or feature does the system deliver?</li> 	<li>Is it an internal, or externally facing system?</li> 	<li>What is the system’s criticality for the business?</li> 	<li>System architecture.</li> </ul>  <p><strong>Observability</strong><br /> Make sure the team is tracking the relevant signals to understand the health of their system, and that those signals are of high quality.</p>  <ul> 	<li>What signals are monitored?</li> 	<li>What dashboards the team uses?</li> 	<li>What telemetry types are used (metrics, tracing, logs)?</li> </ul>  <p><strong>Alerting</strong><br /> If the system goes into failure, are there alerts that can notify the team in a timely manner, without the risk of alert fatigue?</p>  <ul> 	<li>What alerts are in place?</li> 	<li>Is each alert accompanied by a playbook to facilitate incident handling?</li> 	<li>Are alerts connected to SLOs?</li> </ul>  <p><strong>Dependencies</strong><br /> Understand the flow of data across the system and its dependencies. What other systems can impact, or can be impacted by the system under review.</p>  <ul> 	<li>What dependencies does the system have?</li> 	<li>How critical is each dependency to the system’s purpose?</li> 	<li>Discussing reliability practices and their configuration.</li> </ul>  <p><strong>Data Management</strong><br /> Know what data is the system storing, and how the team manages those data stores. Discuss caches, and their eviction policies. Databases, and what level of replication, or sharding is being used.</p>  <ul> 	<li>What data stores does the system use?</li> 	<li>Are there backups, and is the team aware how to restore from a backup?</li> 	<li>Is the system using caches, and what kind of eviction policy do they have?</li> </ul>  <p><strong>Security</strong><br /> Learn how the system protects its data, and how it guards itself against bad actors.</p>  <ul> 	<li>Is access to the system granted only to authorized users?</li> 	<li>Is PII data properly secured?</li> </ul>  <p><strong>Deployments</strong><br /> The method to deploy the components of a system can present some risks. A deployment could risk overloading other systems, or have a dependency that would block a deployment.</p>  <ul> 	<li>What are the steps required to deploy the different components of the system?</li> 	<li>What is the deployment mode (canary, blue green) for those components?</li> 	<li>What kind of testing is executed with each deployment (e.g. end-to-end tests)?</li> 	<li>What signals indicate a successful, or faulty deployment?</li> </ul>  <p><strong>Scalability</strong><br /> Validate that the system is appropriately sized, and can handle spikes in load without being overloaded, or overloading neighboring systems.</p>  <ul> 	<li>How does the system scale?</li> 	<li>Were load tests executed?</li> 	<li>What resources (memory, CPU, dependencies, etc) typically present a bottleneck for the system?</li> 	<li>How does the system protect itself from being overloaded (rate limiting, load shedding)?</li> </ul>  <p><strong>Failure modes</strong><br /> Discuss the ways through which the system can fail, what resilience is built into the system to handle those failures, and how the team would react to said failures. This is often a source of valuable insights, but also where teams often need more guidance.</p>  <ul> 	<li>What are the failure modes of the system? How are they mitigated?</li> </ul>  <p>Being presented with a long template full of questions, many of which may not apply to the system under review, can be quite off putting for the development team. Going into too many details also risks overlap and repetition, which can delay filling out the template, can increase confusion, frustration, and diminish the potential benefits of the PRR. In short, we need to balance information gathering, with the effort required to fill out the template.</p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item even"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-article-image paragraphs-item-article-image paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-8986" id="article-image-8986">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-article-image field-type-image field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><img src="https://www.usenix.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_embedded/public/fig3_12.01.39.png" width="512" height="216" alt="" /></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-article-image-caption field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Figure 3: Tradeoffs in level of detail of PRR template questions.</div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item odd"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-8987" id="single-column-text-8987">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p>In my experience, the model that works best is to have a template that covers every area, but without going into too many details, meaning the template does not become too long. During the review, reviewers have the chance to dive deeper in areas where they believe to be relevant (i.e. where they see a potential for higher risks). It should be noted that this places a bigger burden on the review team, as they require a certain level of experience to be able to spot the areas where deep dives are required. This burden can be minimised by separately documenting guidance to help reviewers with those deep dives.</p>  <p>Let’s go through an example concerning reliability patterns (retries, fallbacks, circuit breakers, timeouts). Below we have 7 questions that go into increasingly higher levels of detail.</p>  <ul> 	<li>“Do you use reliability patterns (retries, fallbacks, circuit breakers, timeouts)?”</li> 	<li>“Which reliability patterns (retries, fallbacks, circuit breakers, timeouts) are used in the system?”</li> 	<li>“Which reliability patterns (retries, fallbacks, circuit breakers, timeouts) are used in the system, and where are they being used?”</li> 	<li>“Which reliability patterns (retries, fallbacks, circuit breakers, timeouts) are used in the system, where are they being used, and how were they configured?”</li> 	<li>“Which reliability patterns (retries, fallbacks, circuit breakers, timeouts) are used in the system, where are they being used, how were they configured, and how did you arrive at those values?”</li> 	<li>“Which reliability patterns (retries, fallbacks, circuit breakers, timeouts) are used in the system, where are they being used, how were they configured, how did you arrive at those values, and how are you monitoring whether these patterns are being activated?”</li> 	<li>“Which reliability patterns (retries, fallbacks, circuit breakers, timeouts) are used in the system, where are they being used, how were they configured, how did you arrive at those values, how are you monitoring whether these patterns are being activated, and do you have automated tests in place to validate that they work as expected?”</li> </ul>  <p>It is fair to say that the first question is rather superficial. It’s a ‘yes or no’ question, with plenty of room for risks to remain unnoticed. I would also argue that the last question is the one that really provides you with all the information you need to gauge if reliability patterns are being correctly applied. Very often, when we asked about circuit breaker, or timeout configurations, teams would admit to simply using the library’s defaults, without consideration for the performance of the service being called. Asking this question often drove the development team to revise their settings. If we want to maximise information gathering, it makes sense to include the last question in the template.</p>  <p><br /> But we also need to account for the effort required from the development teams. In a system with one or two dependencies, it shouldn’t take so long to gather that data. However, the same cannot be said about larger, more complex systems, with multiple dependencies (internal or external). Also consider that it is unlikely that all of those dependencies are equally important, and as a consequence, not all will be equally deserving of the reviewers’ attention.</p>  <p>For every topic, the level of detail you will pick will depend on your situation. You will need to consider the experience of those that would be your reviewers (could they reason through the data they would receive?), the engineering maturity of your organisation (would they be able to understand what is being asked, without significant support?), and the topic itself (is there enough depth in the topic for the PRR to go into? - An example: If teams only deploy applications via the company’s internal tooling, there won’t be much to learn from a deep dive into deployment tooling).</p>  <p>Regarding the different architectures that can be under review, my recommendation is to ‘modularize’ the template. Identify which questions are independent of the architecture, which ones could have different interpretations depending on the architecture, and which ones are specific for a given architecture. The latter group you can break into their own sections, so that development teams can quickly skip them when filling out the template.</p>  <p>The one thing to keep in mind is that it is not critical to get it right the first time. You can, and should, iterate on the template. Listen to feedback from your peers, and from the teams that go through the PRR process. Very often, between rounds of PRRs, we made changes to the PRR template (big or small), and your experience with PRRs should not be different.</p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item even"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-8988" id="single-column-text-8988">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Picking the review team</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p>The broad set of topics covered in a PRR already informs some of the ingredients expected of the review team. At the bare minimum, reviewers will have to be knowledgeable in those topics. But there are other ingredients to consider, coming from the system under review. For example, if the system employs an asynchronous architecture based on message queues, at least one of the reviewers should be familiar with that architecture; if the system uses a NoSQL datastore, reviewers should be able to reason about the NoSQL paradigm.</p>  <p>To maximise the potential to identify risks, and remove biases, reviewers should be external to the team. Some degree of familiarity with the domain can be helpful, though.</p>  <p>In terms of review team size, two reviewers tends to be the sweet spot. It makes it easier to cover all the topics of the review without a single reviewer having to be knowledgeable in all of the areas, while also making it easier for a reviewer to notice something the other reviewer may have missed. </p>  <p>Larger groups of reviewers are not advised. The bigger the group, the bigger the logistical difficulties. For starters, you will have to find more people to conduct reviews. It’s harder to get everyone together, and more people can prolong the process as it is more likely to result in longer discussions, and can make it harder to agree on a set of risks and recommendations.</p>  <p><br /> <strong>Reviewers as a potential bottleneck for PRRs</strong><br /> When trying to adopt the PRR process in an organisation where the SRE team owns the process and is the only source of reviewers, that team can easily become a bottleneck for the process. There are two situations where this could happen: the process is in high demand; or, some event drove the team to run PRRs for multiple systems at the same time. In both cases, you will quickly run out of SREs to review all of the systems, making PRRs a full time job, and development teams waiting for a long time for their system to be reviewed – and remember that those teams could be on a deadline.</p>  <p>To avoid becoming a bottleneck, identify other potential reviewers in your organisation. If there are Staff+, then these would be good candidates to review PRRs. In the absence of Staff+, or if the number of Staff+ engineers is also low, look for Senior Engineers with an operational mindset. This could be a great growth and knowledge sharing opportunity for any that participate.</p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item odd"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-8989" id="single-column-text-8989">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Engaging the development team</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p>The number of meetings between the reviewing team and the development team will depend on the complexity of the system under review, and the experience of the development team. Two to four sessions is typical in my experience.</p>  <p>Outside of these joint working sessions, most of the work in the PRR will be asynchronous. It can be efficient to work in a collaborative document, where those involved can tag others, write comments, notes, and ask questions. You can also set up a channel for an on-going asynchronous collaboration between review and development teams.<br />  </p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item even"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-article-image paragraphs-item-article-image paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-8990" id="article-image-8990">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-article-image field-type-image field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><img src="https://www.usenix.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_embedded/public/fig4_3.png" width="1146" height="463" alt="" /></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-article-image-caption field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Figure 4: Working sessions involved in a PRR.</div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item odd"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-8991" id="single-column-text-8991">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p>The first session will be a Meet &amp; Greet with the development team. To nudge things along, in the invite for the first session include the following elements:</p>  <ul> 	<li>Introduce the review team members.</li> 	<li>Links to any documentation about the PRR process.</li> 	<li>A link to the template while encouraging the teams to already have a look, and possibly filling out what sections they can.</li> </ul>  <p>Use this session to do a walkthrough of the process and the template for teams doing this for the first time. Teams more familiar with PRRs, however, may already come with the template partially filled out.</p>  <p>Arguably, the most important part of the first session is to make it clear for the development team that the PRR is for their benefit. Clear any misconception that the review team is some sort of gatekeeper, and emphasize that you are working together with them to make sure that whatever they are looking to launch will be a success.</p>  <p>In this session establish a timeline for the PRR execution to keep things on track, and conduct a timely review. Schedule in advance the sessions you think will be necessary. This will help the team keep up the pace, while preventing the PRR process from dragging on. When deciding the interval between sessions, consider how familiar or foreign the system‘s domain is to the reviewers (the more foreign, the more clarifications the reviewers will need), and also the complexity of the system under review.</p>  <p>The Q&amp;A sessions are useful for both review and development teams. In these sessions, the development team can clarify some unclear aspects of the template. For the review team, Q&amp;A sessions are valuable to address more challenging aspects of the system under review, where channel or document comments are not well suited to provide clarifications. Expect to have at least 1 to 2 Q&amp;A sessions.</p>  <p>When the development team has added all of the relevant information in the template, and the review team has clarified any open points, the review team will have all the data it needs to finalize the list of risks. That list should include: what risks were identified; their criticality; recommendations on how to address the risk</p>  <p>That list will then be presented in the final Review Session. In this last session, both development and review teams will have the chance to go into more details on the risks, their impact, and the recommendations. After the final review session is done, share the review outcome by email with the development team, as well as their leadership. This email will mark the end of the PRR process.</p>  <p>In my experience, most risks will be easy to handle, particularly in organisations with mature engineering practices. Occasionally, some more critical risks will be identified (like single points of failure without resilience or mitigation strategies, or potential to overload neighboring systems). On very rare occasions – but it has happened – it should be made abundantly clear to the development team that the system under review should not go live at all, until a considerable redesign has taken place. In this last case, it makes sense to have a more direct approach to the development team’s leadership. When escalating to management, the message should be carefully crafted to avoid any undesired consequences for the development team. Handle it like you would a postmortem, and adopt a blameless tone.</p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item even"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-8992" id="single-column-text-8992">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Surfacing common operational risks</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p>If you are conducting many PRRs you can spot patterns of operational challenges across multiple systems, and tech stacks. You can then take those patterns and use them as input for your organisation’s tech strategy, in order to address those challenges. Common challenges that come to light are observability gaps; misconfigured retries, rate limits and timeouts; and insufficient data recovery and disaster recovery planning and preparation. You may also find documentation issues or gaps - solving these can help engineers across your organisation use your tools and platforms more effectively.</p>  <p>Identifying these kinds of gaps and common patterns can be greatly facilitated by building into the process, or the template, ways to quickly surface this data. That could be done by hosting all your PRRs – or at least their final report – in a single place, and using tags on the document. Or, as part of the report itself, signaling the areas where improvement was needed in that PRR. Automation could then process those files, read the tags, and easily identify the most common issues.</p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item odd"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-8993" id="single-column-text-8993">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Why PRRs fail</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p>PRRs, like any other initiative, can fail. One major reason is a lack of buy-in. A PRR is ideally connected to some sort of event (new launch, redesign, high stakes business event). This will ensure focus from the development team, and that they will have time to work on it. Running a PRR without any specific goal means that the PRR can drop to the bottom of the development team’s priority list. If this is the case, it will help considerably to have buy-in from the team’s management, and a commitment to allocate resources to complete the PRR.</p>  <p>If the development team feels threatened by the review, or that the team itself is under review, they can go on the defensive, and actively hide any potential risk in the system to avoid ‘failing’ the review. Make sure the message that you are there to help the team is passed along in a clear manner.</p>  <p>Finally, the work involved in filling in the PRR template needs to be acceptable to the development team. Keep the template current, relevant, usable, and no more complex than absolutely necessary. Listen to the feedback from the teams to understand what could be improved. Find ways to automate fetching the answers to some of the questions (e.g. automatically listing dashboards for the services included in the review). This will not only speed up the process, but make filling out the template less of a boring task for the development team.</p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item even"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-8994" id="single-column-text-8994">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">PRRs: A Critical Feedback Loop</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p>In many organisations, SRE time is scarce and demand for production expertise is high.

However, in addition to that, PRRs provide the reviewing team with invaluable data about how engineering teams are working with existing infrastructure, tools, and processes; and what common operational problems and gaps exist. PRRs are thus also a critical feedback loop between development teams and those who shape the infrastructure, platforms, tools, documentation, and processes which development teams use.</p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div></div></div><legend><span class="fieldset-legend">Appendix</span></legend><div class="fieldset-wrapper"><div class="field field-name-field-lvl2-appendix-refs field-type-text field-label-above"><div class="field-label">References:&nbsp;</div><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><a class="anchor" name="reference-1"></a></div><div class="field-item even"><a class="anchor" name="reference-2"></a></div><div class="field-item odd"><a class="anchor" name="reference-3"></a></div><div class="field-item even"><a class="anchor" name="reference-4"></a></div><div class="field-item odd"><a class="anchor" name="reference-5"></a></div><div class="field-item even"><a class="anchor" name="reference-6"></a></div><div class="field-item odd"><a class="anchor" name="reference-7"></a></div><div class="field-item even"><a class="anchor" name="reference-8"></a></div><div class="field-item odd"><a class="anchor" name="reference-9"></a></div></div></div></div>

On our Innovation Days in February and March 2024 we ran tabletop exercises of some of our Disaster Recovery Plans (DRP).</p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item even"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-8877" id="single-column-text-8877">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Problems</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p>Our team has had DRPs for at least our major customer-, patron-, or user-facing services since at least 2008 (the oldest template I could find), but we identified several problems:</p>  <ul> 	<li>Our assumptions were poor. Most plans only assumed natural disasters such as an earthquake or tornado. Only some (but not all) of the plans assumed service, server, or component failure. Few plans specified recovery steps beyond “Rebuild from scratch” and “Restore from tape.”</li> 	<li>Our documentation was incomplete. Most services didnʼt have a current build guide to use as a basis for rebuilding. Not all of our existing production services had DRPs. When spinning up a new service, the plan author would often make a copy of someone elseʼs plan and edit it… even if that plan was missing one or more sections from the template.</li> 	<li>Our testing was inconsistent. We tested each disaster recovery plan at least annually, but testing could be performed differently depending on the plan owner. Most would perform a (solo) thought experiment, but a few would build a new VM, stand up the service using its build guide, restore from backups, and compare it to the production VM.</li> </ul>  <p>Plan authors often worked in isolation and could have different assumptions than other authors, such as one assuming that scheduled tasks would be easily remembered or recovered, even if the system was upgraded. Furthermore, the original author of the plan was likely the service owner, service manager, or technical lead when it was first written… but staff turnover and service reassignments meant a different person became responsible for that plan and could have different assumptions than the previous owner.</p>  <p><br /> Our web hosting environment serviceʼs DRP is an example of this: it was written/created by one person who left for another school, taken over by a second person who left for a different unit at the university, and is now owned by a third… whose tenure didnʼt overlap with the first. Each of the three likely had different assumptions and blind spots. For example, when the servers were upgraded the scheduled tasks that copied site archives to long-term storage and deleted them from local disk were themselves deleted, and nobody noticed until after the older OS backups expired.</p>  <p><br /> We wanted all plan owners to:</p>  <ul> 	<li>Operate with a common set of assumptions.</li> 	<li>Identify all service dependencies up and down the stack.</li> 	<li>Write and test their plans the same way.</li> </ul> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item odd"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-8878" id="single-column-text-8878">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">What goes into a DRP?</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p>To address writing plans the same way, in 2022 we standardized our DRP template and included embedded guidance about using it. Its major sections are:</p>  <ul> 	<li><strong>Description</strong> — A high-level overview of the service itself</li> 	<li><strong>Dependencies</strong> — A list of specific dependencies on which this service depends and a list of which other services depends on this service</li> 	<li><strong>Hardware</strong> — A list of physical and virtual hardware for the service, including host names and IP addresses, model and serial numbers for physical hardware and hypervisor environment for virtual hardware, the CPU count, memory size, disk size, location (data center, row, rack, and position), and any inventory assetID. If the service runs on virtual machines then there won’t be model numbers, serial numbers, or assetIDs</li> 	<li><strong>Software</strong> — A list of any specific software for the service (with specific version numbers if applicable, such as "libfoo.so.12 only" or "version 23 or earlier." This is only required where a software vendor mandates certain versions of dependencies.</li> 	<li><strong>Configuration</strong> — Any specific configuration information, such as service account names or database user accounts; passwords should be in your password management solution</li> 	<li><strong>Security and facilities</strong> — Details about the physical security for the hardware and the online security of the servers, appliances, databases, and so on</li> 	<li><strong>Backups</strong> — Details about how the service components (such as databases or servers) are backed up</li> 	<li><strong>Operations</strong> — Information about the service operations: when and how the DRP will be tested; what the minimal and fully operational standards are, such as "single server read only" versus "multiple server read-write;" where the operational documentation such as architecture diagrams, build guide, run books, administrators guide, users guide, and so on are; and any service-specific scheduled tasks</li> 	<li><strong>Contacts</strong> — Contact information for the service management, including the service owner, service manager, and technical leads for the service; any service-specific customer email lists for notification purposes; people at any partner organizations who may provide dependencies or be dependent (such as Facilities or Plant Operations); and any hardware, software, or service vendors involved in providing the service or its components</li> 	<li><strong>Service levels and impac</strong>t — Information about the impact of the service not being available, including but not limited to one or more of Service Level Agreement (SLA), Service Level Expectations (SLE), Operating Level Agreement (OLA), a statement of impact, impact timelines, and maximum acceptable downtime</li> </ul>  <p>Not all plans require all of that information.

One researcher's grant requires the server and its data to be in a specific locked rack, so we can't move it to another data center or to another rack in this data center. We also identified two open questions to answer after the session:</p>  <ul> 	<li>Are all of our disks encrypted at rest, so theft of a drive doesn't mean the thief can access that research data?</li> 	<li>What really happens when someone presses the emergency power-off (EPO) button?

One respondent said they "learned quite a bit about DRPs and how we should handle things." A second respondent said "It was good to see the thought processes and priorities for each member of the team and the collaboration in solving problems (or creating them) as we worked our way through the virtual incident." A third said that "The opportunity to dig into some deep thoughts on some very multifaceted problems as an entire team was enormously helpful." Several felt the roundtable discussion was helpful and the session "worked out well as a brain-storming session" and "was helpful for those not involved in the operation of the service to understand the challenges it would experience during a disaster recovery procedure." People identified holes in their own plans, new things to think about, perspectives to change, and a deeper understanding of the service itself.</p>  <p><br /> However, some thought that we got lost in the weeds a bit. One respondent said "It's easy to go down some pretty deep rabbit holes. There's a balance here, because those rabbit holes sometimes dig up value, and sometimes don't." Another respondent wanted the problem to get more clearly defined as we worked our way through the discussions. In addition, including our Major Incident (MI) communications and coordination process was an unnecessary complication. One person provided our favorite comment: “This exercise was terrifying.”</p>  <p><br /> We agreed with the feedback. For the second session we defined the initial problems more clearly and omitted the MI process.</p>  <p><br /> After the second session people thought that the more-focused topics were easier to manage and the open discussion was still helpful. We focused more on technical actions than communication actions which was an improvement. However, some still thought we spent too much time going down rabbit holes and that the scope may have been too narrow for everyone to feel like they were contributing.<br />  </p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item odd"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-8888" id="single-column-text-8888">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Next steps</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p>At the end of each session we identified next steps for both the participants and the facilitators. Participants were asked to update their services' plans to include the common dependencies and anything else the plans were missing. Those common dependencies that some people thought were "too obvious to list" included:</p>  <ul> 	<li>Power and cooling</li> 	<li>Networking</li> 	<li>Centrally-provided backup, database, server, and storage services</li> 	<li>Authentication services, including our 2-factor provider and our password management solution</li> 	<li>Time services on which the authentication services depend</li> 	<li>Notification channels, such as chat, email, and social media</li> 	<li>Documentation storage, such as an external service, knowledge bases, wikis, or local or network-attached disk</li> </ul>  <p>Participants were also asked to create missing or update existing architecture, build, or design documents, to implement any remaining takeaways from the discussion, and to reconsider restoration time versus the declared maximum acceptable downtime. For example, if it would take two days to get replacement hardware spun up and another four days to restore the data, then without access to a time machine the maximum acceptable downtime cannot be less than six days. If there's a disconnect then either the business unit has to accept a longer maximum acceptable downtime or they have to provide funding for the design, implementation, and operation of the service to meet their requirement of that shorter maximum acceptable downtime.</p>  <p><br /> In the short term the facilitators would analyze the survey results and feedback, discuss them at subsequent team meetings, decide on a cadence for repeating the exercises (annually in February and March), and develop a training module and documentation templates to train additional facilitators. For the university they also reached out to the Disaster Recovery/Business Continuity Community of Practice leads about presenting our exercises and results.<br />  </p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item even"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-8889" id="single-column-text-8889">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Additional considerations</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p>If you're working on your own disaster recovery plans we have some recommendations for things you should consider.<br /> When writing your plans:</p>  <ul> 	<li>Do you have associated architecture and build documents?</li> 	<li>Do you keep them updated when things change?</li> 	<li>Is there a change log so you can move from "Rebuild as documented" to the state immediately before the disaster?</li> 	<li>What if the plan links to an external source but there's no network access or either you or they have fallen off the Internet?</li> </ul>  <p><br /> When testing your plans:</p>  <ul> 	<li>How much testing is enough?</li> 	<li>Are you "just" doing the thought experiment or are you building new servers and restoring the data before comparing them to production?</li> 	<li>How and how often are you testing: for example, do you do a thought experiment annually and rebuild it every 3–5 years?<br /> 	 </li> </ul> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item odd"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-8890" id="single-column-text-8890">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Wrapping up</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p>We set out to revamp our DRPs and make them more useful: we wanted to explore a broader range of scenarios, find incomplete documentation and testing, and identify where team members held differing assumptions about our infrastructure capabilities and requirements.

These exercises aimed to refine our DRPs by revealing weaknesses and improving the team's understanding of them… and terrified some team members. In short, we learned a lot, both about our systems and about running DRPs: who should be involved, how broad or narrow the focus should be, and how to structure the discussions. We also had a lot of productive conversations with each other and with the business units we serve.</p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item even"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-8891" id="single-column-text-8891">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Resources</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p>Some resources that may be helpful if you're going to run your own tabletop exercises include:</p>  <ul> 	<li><a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/technology-services/drp-tabletop-exercises.html" target="_blank">Our project management page for the tabletop exercises</a></li> 	<li><a href="https://safecomputing.umich.edu/protect-the-u/protect-your-unit/disaster-recovery-management" target="_blank">The “Disaster Recovery Management” page</a> at the U-M “Safe Computing” website</li> 	<li><a href="https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/projects/backdoorsandbreaches/" target="_blank">Backdoors &amp; Breaches</a>, an incident response card game</li> </ul>  <p> </p>  <p>Also useful is the <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/services/cisa-tabletop-exercise-packages" target="_blank">Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Tabletop Exercise Package (CTEP)</a>, especially:</p>  <ul> 	<li><a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-01/3_-_ctep_facilitator_evaluator_handbook_2020_final_508.pdf" target="_blank">Critical Infrastructure Tabletop Exercise Program</a> (26-page PDF)</li> 	<li><a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-01/2_-_ctep_exercise_planner_handbook_2021_final_508.pdf" target="_blank">Exercise Planner Handbook</a> (40-page PDF)</li> 	<br /> 	<li> </li> </ul> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div></div></div><legend><span class="fieldset-legend">Appendix</span></legend><div class="fieldset-wrapper"><div class="field field-name-field-lvl2-appendix-refs field-type-text field-label-above"><div class="field-label">References:&nbsp;</div><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><a class="anchor" name="reference-1"></a></div><div class="field-item even"><a class="anchor" name="reference-2"></a></div><div class="field-item odd"><a class="anchor" name="reference-3"></a></div><div class="field-item even"><a class="anchor" name="reference-4"></a></div><div class="field-item odd"><a class="anchor" name="reference-5"></a></div><div class="field-item even"><a class="anchor" name="reference-6"></a></div><div class="field-item odd"><a class="anchor" name="reference-7"></a></div><div class="field-item even"><a class="anchor" name="reference-8"></a></div><div class="field-item odd"><a class="anchor" name="reference-9"></a></div><div class="field-item even"><a class="anchor" name="reference-10"></a></div><div class="field-item odd"><a class="anchor" name="reference-11"></a></div><div class="field-item even"><a class="anchor" name="reference-12"></a></div><div class="field-item odd"><a class="anchor" name="reference-13"></a></div><div class="field-item even"><a class="anchor" name="reference-14"></a></div></div></div></div>

One promising solution is the recent interest in far memory systems which pool the memory capacity across the servers over a network and allow more flexible memory allocations from the pool capacity. Despite providing a uniform memory abstraction to applications, these systems still work with a two-tiered (faster local and slower remote) memory underneath, and have to efficiently manage applications’ data between these two tiers to avoid significant application slowdown.</p>  <p>Existing far memory systems broadly fall into two categories. On one hand, paging-based systems use hardware guards at the granularity of pages to intercept remote accesses, thus requiring no application changes, but incur significant faulting overhead. On the other hand, app-integrated systems use software guards on data objects and apply application-specific optimizations to avoid faulting overheads, but these systems require significant application redesign and/or suffer from overhead on local accesses. </p>  <p>In this article, we present a new approach to far memory called Eden. Our key insight is that applications generate most of their page faults at a small number of code locations, and those locations are easy to find programmatically. Based on this insight, Eden combines hardware guards with a small number of software guards in the form of programmer annotations (or hints), to achieve performance similar to app-integrated systems but with significantly less developer effort.</p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item even"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-8838" id="single-column-text-8838">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Far Memory</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p>The cost of DRAM as a fraction of total cost of ownership (TCO) for hyperscalers has been growing at an alarming rate. A study at Meta estimates that the DRAM cost as a fraction of the cost of a server in their data centers rose from 15% in their oldest generation to 37% in their latest <span><a href="#reference-1">[</a></span><span><a href="#reference-1">1]</a></span>. Similarly, Microsoft estimates the same fractional cost to soon reach up to 50% of the server cost in their data centers <a href="#reference-1">[2]</a>. Given these trends, memory stranding—a common issue that results from imperfect scheduling of workloads with variable memory demands across servers with fixed memory capacity—becomes an increasingly expensive problem. These trends have prompted research efforts to address memory stranding by seamlessly exposing memory over the network from underutilized servers to oversubscribed servers, an idea referred to as far memory.</p>  <div> <p>While the term is new, far memory is far from a new idea. Network-based memory pooling has been explored way back in the 90s, with systems like GMS <span><a href="#reference-3">[3]</a></span> extending the operating system to transparently spill data to remote servers, but such systems clearly haven’t seen much adoption due to the large gap in latency between DRAM accesses (100s of nanoseconds) and network round trips (few milliseconds). There is, however, a renewed interest today as the networks move from a millisecond to a microsecond era. While DRAM latency has not improved substantially (10s of nanoseconds now), advancements in networking hardware and adoption of technologies like RoCE <span><a href="#reference-4">[4]</a></span> are delivering ever-higher bandwidth and lower latency communication between the servers—only a couple of µs within the rack. The large reduction in the remote-to-local memory access gap suggests performance concerns might not be insurmountable this time around. While smaller however, the gap persists, and the application slowdown caused by memory accesses that go over the network still remains a key barrier to far memory adoption. Thus, minimizing remote accesses with careful memory placement between local and remote memory is critical. At the same time, making remote memory transparent to the application is also important to avoid any application changes, which is also necessary for wider adoption. Existing far memory systems work towards and tussle between these two often-opposing goals.</p> </div> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item odd"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-8839" id="single-column-text-8839">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">The traditional approach to Far Memory</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p><span>The most straightforward approach to support far memory is to repurpose the OS paging hardware/software mechanisms to guard against and handle the far memory accesses.  Application memory pages not in active use can be offloaded by transparently unmapping the pages from the application’s address space (page tables).  Future accesses to this memory, guarded by the processor hardware that includes the translation look-aside buffer (TLB) and the memory management unit (MMU), trigger page faults that are handled by the OS paging mechanisms, which then fetch the pages from swap and map them into page tables. One recent system that uses this approach is Fastswap <a href="#reference-5">[5]</a>.</span></p>  <p><span>The advantage of this page-based approach is that it requires no application modification as it extends the same virtual memory abstraction that has been traditionally used to hide the physical memory to include remote memory. The approach also introduces no new overheads when all the data (pages) are in local memory, unlike app-integrated systems as we discuss below. However, the complete transparency of the approach, which has historically been its strength, also prevents the OS kernel from obtaining the fine-grained memory access information needed to implement workload-informed policies that could significantly improve performance.</span></p>  <p><span>To understand these challenges, let’s use a synthetic example of a Web server frontend (borrowed from AIFM <a href="#reference-6">[6]</a>) that lets users store their data (e.g., photos) and request them as necessary. The application stores user metadata in a hash table (128-B entries) which indexes into a large array where the images (8 KB, 2 typical OS pages) are stored.  Compared to the array, the hash table is accessed far more intensely (32x under their sample workload) but also at much finer granularity (64x) for each request on average (outlined in Figure 1). To understand how this application behaves with OS-based far memory, we run it with Fastswap, a recent OS extension to support far memory <a href="#reference-5">[5]</a>. Note that we can run the application as is without any changes. We then measure the request throughput under a Zipf (1.0) distribution as we limit the size of local memory available to the application; Figure 1 (right) shows the performance normalized to fully local configuration. We see that the performance with OS-based far memory (Kernel) degrades almost linearly despite the fact that by far most accesses go to the much smaller hash table that fits in a fifth of the total memory usage. Digging further, we observed that, in absence of fine-grained access information, the OS lets the larger blob array pages kick out the much denser and more performance-critical hash-table pages to remote memory.</span></p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item even"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-article-image paragraphs-item-article-image paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-8851" id="article-image-8851">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-article-image field-type-image field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><img src="https://www.usenix.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_embedded/public/9xpqdnnf99vwczk.png" width="1440" height="399" alt="" /></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-article-image-caption field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Figure 1: Memory layout of the Synthetic web server frontend example application and its performance with OS-based (Fastswap) and app-integrated (AIFM) far memory systems.</div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item odd"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-8840" id="single-column-text-8840">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Application-integration can unlock access patterns</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><div> </div>  <div>In the previous example, if the OS had known beforehand that the access density for the hash table was much higher (and, in fact, gates any accesses to the blob array) and strictly prioritized hash table data in eviction decisions, the performance degradation might not have been as dramatic, at least as long as the hash table fit in local memory. Unfortunately, virtual memory’s flat addressing makes it difficult for the OS to identify disparate data structures and, as a consequence, such access density differences are hard to capture accurately from coarse-grained page access information. An alternative is to explicitly convey such information to the OS/memory manager (either through manual annotation or compiler assistance)  to enable informed memory management. Specifically, in our example, we need to make the OS aware of the two discrete memory regions with disparate access patterns i.e., hash table and blob array, and that these groups should be prioritized differently. Indeed, recent systems like AIFM <a href="#reference-6">[6]</a> seek to achieve this goal by integrating memory management with the application.</div>  <div> <p><span>App-integrated systems like AIFM move far-memory management completely into the application and manage memory at object granularity, in a fashion similar to object-based language runtimes like the Java virtual machine. By operating at object granularity, they enable the runtime to track/isolate memory accesses to various data structures in the application and let the programmer or compiler provide insight into the expected access behavior among different data structure groups (e.g., prioritization between data structures) or within them (e.g., data structure-specific prefetching schemes). For our example application, the AIFM authors modified it to allocate memory using AIFM’s custom object-based memory allocator where the hash table and blob array objects are marked with different data-structure identifiers (DSIDs). All object accesses must be modified to use AIFM’s memory-access interface based on C++ smart pointers, to be handled by the AIFM runtime. The interface then optionally lets the programmer flag certain accesses as non-temporal, i.e., free to evict them after use, which the authors use to set the less-critical blob-array accesses as non-temporal, dramatically improving the performance (green line in Figure 1). This example demonstrates the power of even simple workload awareness in optimizing data placement, and thereby improving application performance, in a far memory setting.</span></p> </div> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item even"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-8841" id="single-column-text-8841">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">The costs of a fine-grained object interface</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p>However, there are downsides to the object-based approach. Without the TLB/MMU support that page-based systems avail, this design requires guarding all object accesses in software, with, e.g., indirect pointers (AIFM uses C++ smart pointers) upon which the runtime can interpose to check that the data is in local memory, and if not, read it from far memory.  This pervasive indirection can add significant additional overhead; the astute reader may have noticed this overhead at 100% local memory in Figure 1. Furthermore, for correctness, these guards must be added at every potential far memory access which can result in significant code modifications. For example, porting a C++ DataFrame library <a href="#reference-7">[7]</a> (which is similar to Python Pandas) to use AIFM required modifying 1100 (7.7%) of the nearly 15500 total lines of code.</p>  <div> <p>There have been efforts to address both of these limitations. To avoid invoking guards on every access, AIFM employs programmer-assisted dereference scopes—small blocks in the program code—wherein the object is marked unevictable and guards are avoided using native pointers. Such optimizations, while helpful, are not always applicable (e.g., streaming workloads where objects experience a single access) and may even add to the programmer burden. For example, the DataFrame library above sees up to 30% slowdown with AIFM even after these guard optimizations.  </p>  <p>In an effort to reduce the burden on programmers, AIFM provides far-memory-aware versions of standard data structures (e.g., C++ STL library), but many sophisticated applications eschew such generic libraries in favor of more efficient alternatives. More recently, systems such as <span>TrackFM <a href="#reference-8">[8]</a> and Mira <a href="#reference-9">[9]</a> </span> use compiler techniques to programmatically insert software guards in arbitrary code. While effective at reducing programmer burden, neither can eliminate the overhead of guards. They are also burdened by compiler limitations like the restricted scope of static analysis techniques such as when the compiler cannot statically resolve branching, function calls, or shared accesses from multiple threads. For correctness, they require source code for external library dependencies of an application which may not always be available. In addition, they also result in larger binaries (2.4× with TrackFM) and longer compilation times (6×). While these efforts represent a promising direction, we ask a fundamentally different question with Eden: <strong>Do we need to resort to an object-based approach and necessitate interposing/guarding every potential far memory access in the program to unlock access patterns?</strong></p> </div> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item odd"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-8842" id="single-column-text-8842">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Eden’s key insight</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p>Not surprisingly, our answer is that it is not necessary to guard every memory access in a program, even those that operate on data structures that may be stored in far memory. To understand why, let’s look at the far memory accesses for the DataFrame library when deployed on a page-based system like Fastswap. We run it with a standard analytics benchmark and capture all the page-faulting (i.e., far-memory accessing) code locations as we limit the local memory available to just 10% of its maximum memory footprint (RSS), using our custom fault tracing tool (<span><a href="https://github.com/eden-farmem/fltrace">https://github.com/eden-farmem/fltrace</a>)</span>. Even at this extreme configuration, we observe that of the 15,000 total lines of code, only 155 of them ever access pages that are not currently local. Moreover, if we order them by access frequency, the top-11 code locations cover 95% of all the far memory accesses! In other words, in theory we should be able to characterize the vast majority of far memory accesses and convey it to the runtime by focusing on just these 11 code locations. We did a similar profiling again at 10% local memory for a range of workloads from various suites like PARSEC, key-value stores from LK_PROFILE and graph algorithms from CRONO. Figure 2 shows the results indicating that this is a general trend: <strong>In most cases, a small number of code locations cover 95% of faults—12 locations at the median and fewer than 32 for all applications.</strong> A more in-depth study from our earlier work <a href="#reference-10">[10]</a> also shows that the set of locations do not change much as we change the local memory ratio. Manual analysis reveals the reason is straightforward: a few “hot” code paths are responsible for most page faults in these applications. At even 10% of the maximum resident set size, local memory is sufficiently large that each page brought in on a code path tends to remain available for later page accesses in that path. As a result, only the initial reference on a given path is likely to cause a fault. </p>  <p><span>Of course, there are still occasional non-local references made by other lines of code.  Yet, Amdahl's Law suggests that even if servicing these rare, unexpected page faults is relatively expensive, they are unlikely to scupper overall performance.  Hence, the relevant question becomes: What kind of far-memory interface/system design could let us exploit these few code locations to implement performance optimizations while preserving correctness across the remaining, untouched memory accesses? Our answer is Eden.</span></p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item even"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-article-image paragraphs-item-article-image paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-8852" id="article-image-8852">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-article-image field-type-image field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><img src="https://www.usenix.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_embedded/public/7f6nbuitfvt2jss.png" width="1440" height="375" alt="" /></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-article-image-caption field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Figure 2: The number of unique lines of source code that account for 100% (blue) and 95% (red) of the page faults in 22 different applications.

Eden achieves this goal by defaulting to traditional, MMU-enforced page faults for unexpected remote accesses, but allowing the developer to add a small number of hints to their program at locations where remote accesses are most likely to occur.  These hints or software guards allow Eden’s runtime to efficiently check in user space whether the needed page is present and initiate its fetch if not. More importantly, these hints provide an opportunity for developers to convey additional application-specific information about their memory-access patterns to customize prefetch and reclamation policies. This parsimonious use of software guards balances their expressive power against their runtime overhead.  Moreover, we provide a tracing tool that automatically identifies lines of code that would benefit from hints to simplify the developer’s task.</span></p>  <p><span>Figure 3 (left) illustrates Eden’s design at a high level. To support lightweight hints/software guards and retain flexibility, Eden performs memory management from a user-space library/runtime within the application, similar to AIFM. To retain hardware guards for most accesses however, Eden manages memory using OS pages. When we combine software and hardware guards, remote data fetches may be initiated either through our user library (software guards) in the common case or rarely via MMU-triggered page faults (hardware guards). To ensure consistent operation for all far memory accesses, Eden routes page faults triggered by hardware guards to its user-level library through Linux Userfaultfd. In either case, Eden’s runtime fetches the page from far memory via RDMA and uses the UFFDIO_COPY ioctl to allocate a physical page, copy the fetched data in, and map it in the process’ page tables. Under memory pressure, Eden first picks the pages to evict to remote memory under a custom policy guided by the programmer hints, protects them with UFFDIO_WRITEPROTECT so that they cannot be modified during eviction and finally unmaps the pages from OS page tables using madvise (MADV_DONTNEED) syscall. One of the key contributions of Eden is to provide batched variants for these Linux syscalls to amortize their overhead for each page <a href="#reference-11">[11]</a>. Finally, Eden provides a hint interface shown in the Figure 3 (right) with basic and extended hints. While basic hints enable the remote accesses to take the faster software path, these hints can be arbitrarily extended to provide workload-specific information such as read-ahead and eviction priority.

Eden meets both these criteria for the two applications we looked at in this article. To port each application to Eden, we first run the unmodified version with our tracing tool to reveal frequently faulting code locations. Figure 4 shows the example output for DataFrame in the flame graph format. The tool runs transparently with LD_PRELOAD for the entire duration of the application. In practice, we were able to find most faulting locations in a few seconds to minutes using small, representative inputs. We then add hints at the top locations, along with the information about the access pattern of that particular data structure and link it with Eden library.</span></p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item even"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-article-image paragraphs-item-article-image paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-8845" id="article-image-8845">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-article-image field-type-image field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><img src="https://www.usenix.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_embedded/public/5on2awxnrtfcxvs.png" width="1440" height="480" alt="" /></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-article-image-caption field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Figure 4: A flame chart for faulting code locations generated for the DataFrame library running with the same analytics benchmark we used for performance evaluation.

Not surprisingly, one location corresponds to the hash table lookup and the other to a blob array access, requiring a hint for each. Recall that our original goal was to differentiate between these two data structures and convey different priorities at each annotation, which we do by setting a higher eviction priority for the hash table access, achieving a similar result as AIFM’s non-temporal feature but without switching to a custom STL library. Adding Eden’s performance to the original Figure 1 in Figure 5 below, we can see that Eden recoups much of the performance lost by OS-based far memory, and even out-performs AIFM when most memory is local due to its vastly decreased software-guard overhead. When local memory becomes extremely constrained, both Eden and AIFM are forced to evict hash-table entries, which leads to I/O amplification in the case of Eden. Specifically, AIFM is able to reference far memory on a per-object (4-B) basis, while Eden must pull in—and evict—entire (4-KB) pages at a time, resulting in less efficient network bandwidth and local memory utilization.</span></p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item even"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-article-image paragraphs-item-article-image paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-8847" id="article-image-8847">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-article-image field-type-image field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><img src="https://www.usenix.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_embedded/public/7tdkxnsav2d3blf.png" width="1440" height="339" alt="" /></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-article-image-caption field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Figure 5: (left) Hints added to the example web server application with hash-table hint on the top and the array hint on the bottom.

Figure 6 (right) shows the normalized run time of an analytics benchmark using the library with various systems. In this case, AIFM performs well due to prefetching as most accesses scan over column vectors. The OS-based prefetcher cannot effectively prefetch as it relies on guessing the trend and interleaved access streams from various concurrent scans throw off its trend detection for even simple sequential scans; AIFM can cleanly separate these streams due to data-structure level access tracking. With Eden, we use the extended hint API to provide specific read-ahead parameters at each hinted location (an example shown in Figure 6), bringing the performance in line with AIFM. Eden achieves this performance with just 23 lines of code modifications, whereas AIFM required almost 1100 to switch to its custom object API, nearly a 50x reduction!</span></p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item even"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-article-image paragraphs-item-article-image paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-8849" id="article-image-8849">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-article-image field-type-image field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><img src="https://www.usenix.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_embedded/public/screenshot_2025-03-20_at_3.49.39_pm.png" width="1440" height="384" alt="" /></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-article-image-caption field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Figure 6: (left) DataFrame app hinting example showing hints for top two faulting locations both of which are on line 692, one for each side of the assignment operator.

Eden uses software guards at the few code locations where most of the remote accesses tend to occur, while relying on hardware guards elsewhere in the application. This approach unlocks workload-informed memory management and provides good performance—better than paging-based approaches (pure hardware guards) and comparable to prior app-integrated systems (pure software guards) without their issues. It does not, however, tackle a few remaining limitations with page-based accesses like the less-efficient local memory and network bandwidth utilization for applications that work with objects much smaller than a typical OS page; we leave these for future work.</span></p>  <p><span>While this article focuses on network-based approaches to far memory, it is worth acknowledging Compute Express Link (CXL.mem) as an emerging PCI-based technology for memory pooling. CXL.mem is not yet widely deployed in production environments, but takes a different design point that further cuts down the latency and enables more efficient out-of-order execution when accessing remote memory. However, it introduces its own challenges including switch infrastructure overhead and additional levels of indirection, and it remains dependent on OS-level policies for hot page detection, reclamation, and prefetching. These limitations suggest that insights from Eden regarding application-specific memory access patterns will remain valuable across both network-based and PCI-based memory pooling paradigms as hardware solutions continue to evolve.</span></p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div></div></div><legend><span class="fieldset-legend">Appendix</span></legend><div class="fieldset-wrapper"><div class="field field-name-field-lvl2-appendix-refs field-type-text field-label-above"><div class="field-label">References:&nbsp;</div><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><a class="anchor" name="reference-1"></a><p>[1] Transparent memory offloading at Meta. <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2022/06/20/data-infrastructure/transparent-memory-offloading-more-memory-at-a-fraction-of-the-cost-and-power/">https://engineering.fb.com/2022/06/20/data-infrastructure/transparent-me...</a></p> </div><div class="field-item even"><a class="anchor" name="reference-2"></a><p>[2] CXL And Gen-Z Iron Out A Coherent Interconnect Strategy. <a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2020/04/03/cxl-and-gen-z-iron-out-a-coherent-interconnect-strategy/ ">https://www.nextplatform.com/2020/04/03/cxl-and-gen-z-iron-out-a-coheren...</a></p> </div><div class="field-item odd"><a class="anchor" name="reference-3"></a><p>[3]&nbsp;M.

Recently, the founders of Codon sent me a pointer to a <a href="https://exaloop.io/blog/codon-2025" target="_blank" title="Codon 2025 blog post">blog post</a> with updates to their project that I found important, in some ways, exciting. </span></p><p><span>When I tried Codon before, I struggled to get a simple script that I use to summarize ;login: downloads to compile. This time around, Codon had none of the problems I encountered the first time around. I attribute this to work done by Codon committers to improve the compiler's ability to convert Python scripts into the intermediate language they then present to an LLVM backend. Not that my script seemed to benefit from being compiled by Codon, taking about as long to run. But my script doesn't do much more than fill up an associative array,  sum the keys, then print the sorted totals as output.</span></p><p>In their blog post, the authors provide charts showing the improvement of Codon over regular Python when running the <a href="https://github.com/spcl/npbench" target="_blank" title="NPBench on Github">NPBench</a> NumPy benchmarks. The geometric mean of speedups is modest, 2.4x, but the maximum is crazy, at 900x. The reason for this is that the Codon team has ported NumPy, a Python library, directly into Codon.</p><p><span>I assumed that the values shown in the chart were correct rather than trying to run the benchmarks myself. I learned a long time ago that attempting to duplicate someone else's benchmark results can be fool's errand: the people who created the hardware or software know much more about how to make it run fast.

The first issue is vendor lock-in. Even though the <a href="https://opentelemetry.io/" target="_blank">OpenTelemetry project</a> is working on defining common API Specifications, protocols and tools, a plethora of competing protocols and SDKs still have valid use cases. With this approach, however, changing the database requires application developers to adapt every application to effectively communicate with the new backend. Reconfiguring the telemetry endpoints will require an application redeployment. Want to rotate credentials? That’s a restart as well. If the storage backend goes down, that’s another edge case for you to handle.</p><p>Another drawback is the limited enrichment capability. If you want your telemetry to contain information about where your application is running, you’ll need to implement this yourself. This either means adding redundant configuration fields or exposing potentially sensitive scheduling APIs to the application — a great way for an attacker to move around your system.</p></div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item odd"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-8791" id="single-column-text-8791">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Let the storage pull telemetry</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p>This approach is mostly based on Prometheus. If you’ve used Prometheus, you’ll know how it turns the data flow upside down and instead of sending your telemetry data to Prometheus, it will instead scrape metrics from your application. This allows for easy switching of the backend, as the application doesn’t need to know anything about the specifics. As the database needs to know where the application is running, this is also a good way to enrich metrics with information about the way the application is deployed. </p></div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item even"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-article-image paragraphs-item-article-image paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-8792" id="article-image-8792">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-article-image field-type-image field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><img src="https://www.usenix.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_embedded/public/fig_3.png" width="800" height="125" alt="" /></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-article-image-caption field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">The database queries the application for telemetry data</div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item odd"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-8793" id="single-column-text-8793">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p>Pulling telemetry is not a silver bullet though.

That’s not the only way to configure them, though. Many collectors can also extract data out of other systems. If you have been around the Prometheus ecosystem for some time, the concept of exporters might be familiar to you. They are small applications that talk to a system and export metrics in a way that’s understandable by Prometheus. The thing to note here is that oftentimes the collector supports getting this data directly. Taking a look at <a href="https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver" target="_blank">opentelemetry-collector-contrib</a> shows receivers for host metrics, Redis, GitHub, and more! There are also a variety of collectors supporting data gathering through eBPF, which is especially useful for applications you are unable to instrument yourself.</p><h3><span>Processors</span></h3><p>Once data has been received, the collector can then run various processors to enrich, filter, or manipulate the data. Common use cases include:</p><ul><li>Adding/Removing/Editing attributes (e.g. this data point originates from node XYZ)</li><li>Redacting sensitive information from logs (e.g. replacing IP addresses in logs with a rough geographic area)</li><li>Generating metrics from traces or logs (e.g. log frequency to request rate) </li><li>Sampling traces (e.g. only keep 10% of traces from successful requests)</li><li>Routing based on attributes (e.g. send data to different storages based on teams)</li></ul><p>Routing to different exporters is a core method used to realize multi-tenancy. Depending on the emitting application, the data can be sent to different storage backends or in different locations.</p><p>Processors can also be used to improve performance and latency by batching writes and splitting the write path by separating the receiver from the exporter.</p><h3><span>Exporters</span></h3><p>Now that everything is processed, the data still needs to get to the backing storage somehow. As with receivers, many different solutions and protocols are supported. By adding authentication information at this layer, developers don’t need to concern themselves with properly authenticating as long as they send data to the collector. This is especially useful if you need to rotate credentials. Would you rather redeploy all applications, or just the collector? When evaluating new solutions, it is also possible to export the data to multiple locations simultaneously.</p><div></div></div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item even"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-8803" id="single-column-text-8803">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">How to deploy a collector </div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p><span>With the functionality of collectors covered, it is time to look at how to deploy the collector.

This flexibility comes at the expense of figuring out what you really want. To counteract this a bit, I’ll leave you with some recommendations to apply when designing your telemetry flow.</span></p><h3><span>Separate telemetry types</span></h3><p><span>Not all telemetry is created equally. An application might produce thousands of logs but only expose a few metrics. The same goes for traces. This also means that different signals scale differently. The good thing is you don’t have to decide on one deployment architecture for everything! A good starting point could be to have one collector per node taking care of logs, while deploying additional collectors per team or application taking care of traces and/or metrics.</span></p><h3><span>Chain collectors</span></h3><p><span>As you might have noticed, some patterns have multiple collectors chained one after another. This allows you to separate concerns between multiple layers of your stack, resulting in smaller and easier to digest configurations. This is especially useful if you need a centralized observability storage but are ingesting from multiple teams with different requirements. At each level, information can be added or removed.</span></p><h3><span>Stay consistent</span></h3><p><span>Yes, the collector supports many different protocols. This still doesn’t mean you should use all protocols available to you. By standardizing on a single protocol early, you remove the need for conversion and have a common terminology when talking about the data in flow. Ideally, you’ll only have to convert at the last step when sending the data off to your storage backend. Conversions work reasonably well but will introduce additional overhead and complexity since not every mapping is clean.</span></p><h3><span>Instrument early</span></h3><p><span>Think about observability from day one. It’s way easier to start building a well-instrumented application from scratch than grafting on libraries to an existing application. Obviously this is not applicable when tasked with modernizing an existing application, but by planning for observability from the beginning, you’ll help your future self during debugging. </span></p><p><span>When starting out, focus on traces first. Especially with web applications, traces allow for a very detailed look into your application and can also be converted to logs or metrics down the line (at the storage layer or in a collector directly!).</span></p><div></div></div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div></div></div>

From hardware interfaces to system software stacks to user applications, everything is already well-established on block devices. Therefore, when non-volatile memory (NVM) emerged, its faster access speed and byte-level access granularity posed significant challenges for system design—everything seemed to need a complete redesign to accommodate these new features. But is redesigning everything really the only solution? Unlike most previous works based on NVM, we show [<a href="#reference-7">7</a>] how to integrate NVM seamlessly and painlessly into the existing block device software stack, providing transparent acceleration to user applications without requiring any changes.</span></p></div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item even"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-8722" id="single-column-text-8722">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Storage Devices and File Systems</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p><span>From punch cards to magnetic tapes and then to disks, external storage devices with persistence have continuously evolved toward miniaturization and higher speeds to meet the need for system state and data preservation in the event of power loss. Among these developments, the emergence of solid-state drives (SSDs) marks a groundbreaking milestone: by eliminating mechanical movement in storage devices, SSDs reduce access latency from the millisecond range to the microsecond range and significantly enhance random access performance.</span></p><p><span>Though storage devices have become faster and faster, accessing disks is still not as straightforward as accessing memory. Disks typically use larger read/write granularity (blocks, usually &gt;= 512B) and have access latencies several orders of magnitude higher than that of DRAM. The development of file systems and associated infrastructure was aimed at addressing these challenges. Disk file systems are generally responsible for managing the layout of file data and metadata on the disk, while providing a certain level of crash consistency guarantees. In addition, systems implement caches (such as the file-backed page cache in Linux) in DRAM for disk files, significantly improving read and write efficiency.</span></p><p><span>Among the various system calls related to file systems, synchronous operations (such as sync, fsync, fdatasync, etc.) are particularly interesting. They emerged with the advent of DRAM file caches—while caching improves file system performance, it also means that writes may not immediately become persistent. To explicitly guarantee that written data has been persisted, users can invoke synchronous operations. This effectively issues a barrier that blocks the current process until the write is committed to disk. Of course, this also means that the cache is bypassed during the synchronous operation, and your process must endure the slow disk I/O. Synchronous operations are crucial for applications like databases that require consistency guarantees, and it is equally important for people like me who habitually save documents frequently.</span></p></div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item odd"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-8723" id="single-column-text-8723">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Non-volatile Memory</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p>As a new form of persistent storage, Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) offers nanosecond-level access latency and can be accessed at the byte granularity, much like DRAM. As a result, traditional storage software stacks designed for larger-granularity, slower devices seem ill-suited for NVM. This novel device has garnered significant attention: researchers have attempted to build new file systems and databases using NVM, or to extend memory space with it (since its single-chip capacity exceeds that of DRAM). For example, in the case of file systems, recent work on NVM largely seeks to bypass the DRAM cache and treat NVM as a directly accessible storage device (e.g., Ext4 DAX [<a href="#reference-1">1</a>], NOVA [<a href="#reference-6">6</a>], PMFS [<a href="#reference-3">3</a>], etc.). By reducing the two-write operation to DRAM and NVM into a single write, these approaches lower the persistence latency of data. Such efforts have shown promising performance in certain workloads.</p><p>However, as we have observed, persistent memory has not seen widespread deployment, except in a few data centers, and Intel discontinued its Optane PMEM [<a href="#reference-2">2</a>] a few years ago. Beyond commercial factors, we believe a key reason for the lack of large-scale success of persistent memory is that it has not been "painlessly" integrated into current systems. New applications designed for NVM often target two key characteristics: first, NVM's high-performance persistence capability, which has led to the development of NVM-based file systems (NVM FS) and databases (NVM DB); second, its large capacity and low cost-per-byte based on DIMM slots, which has inspired tiered memory research.</p><p><span>For the first category of work, although NVM is fast, its performance is still several times lower than DRAM. As a result, while approaches like DAX FS optimize synchronous writes on NVM by bypassing DRAM, they significantly sacrifice the performance of asynchronous writes and reads. More importantly, the persistence process in almost all modern applications is optimized for asynchronous read/write operations, introducing synchronous operations only when consistency must be ensured. Therefore, the performance of NVM FS has not met expectations in most existing applications. For the second category of work, due to Intel's relatively high pricing for Optane, its cost advantage is not obvious, leading to its gradual replacement by memory expansion solutions based on RDMA or CXL.</span></p><p><span>Next, we will focus on discussing NVM's high-speed persistence capabilities.</span></p></div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item even"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-8724" id="single-column-text-8724">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">The Proper Way to Integrate NVM</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p><span>Although NVM offers relatively high persistence speeds, its performance is still lower than that of DRAM. Therefore, we believe that approaches like NOVA, which sacrifice conventional read/write performance to provide optimal synchronous write performance, are likely only suitable for a few specific use cases, such as write-heavy databases. </span></p><p><span>At the same time, while NVM capacities typically range from several hundred GB to a few TB (e.g., with Optane), a single disk can easily offer tens of TB, and disk arrays can provide PB-level capacities at much lower cost-per-byte. Therefore, another issue with replacing disk file systems with NVM file systems is the reduction in available capacity, the significant increase in costs, and the overhead of migrating large amounts of existing data to a new file system.</span></p><p><span>We conducted a performance analysis comparing current disk file systems and NVM file systems. The results in Figure 1 show that when data access is accelerated by DRAM (cache hit), disk file systems outperform NVM file systems. Generally, after an application has been running for a while, the cache hit rate tends to be high. As a result, the advantages of the NVM file system are mostly limited to synchronous write operations.</span></p></div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item odd"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-article-image paragraphs-item-article-image paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-8725" id="article-image-8725">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-article-image field-type-image field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><img src="https://www.usenix.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_embedded/public/plot0.png" width="1440" height="657" alt="" /></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-article-image-caption field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Figure 1.

P2CACHE [<a href="#reference-4">4</a>] provides a strongly consistent file cache by writing all data simultaneously to both DRAM and NVM, thereby eliminating disk I/O for synchronous requests. However, the performance of these approaches may not fully meet expectations. </p><p><span>SPFS optimizes synchronous writes based on predicting consecutive synchronous requests, which makes it difficult to provide effective acceleration when faced with infrequent and irregular synchronous requests common in many applications. Furthermore, once synchronous writes are offloaded to NVM, the upper-level NVM file system takes over subsequent reads and writes for this data, meaning that the performance of subsequent asynchronous reads and writes will be slower than the performance provided by the DRAM cache in the original disk file system.</span></p><p><span>P2CACHE retains the fast path for reading data from DRAM; however, it writes all data, whether synchronous or not, to both DRAM and NVM simultaneously. Since NVM write performance is lower than DRAM, the system’s performance actually degrades for the majority of applications that primarily perform asynchronous writes.</span></p><p><span>Meanwhile, both SPFS and P2CACHE are implemented in a manner similar to independent file systems: they establish and manage indexes for data at runtime, and once data is persisted to the upper-level NVM, it no longer interacts with disk data and can only be migrated to the underlying disk file system periodically and at a coarse granularity. We believe these designs fail to leverage NVM to transparently and efficiently accelerate existing disk file systems. Instead, they are merely another attempt, like NOVA, that optimizes synchronous writes but may slow down other read/write requests.</span></p></div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item odd"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-8727" id="single-column-text-8727">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">NVLog: An Attempt to Elegantly Accelerate Disk File Systems</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p><span>We believe that simply taking over data from the disk is not a wise choice. Our goal is to precisely accelerate the synchronous write operations that slow down the file system, while maintaining the high performance provided by the DRAM cache for other operations. At the same time, this acceleration should be transparent: it should not require changes to user programs or to the time-tested, robust disk file systems. However, this is not an easy task. After analyzing SPFS and P2CACHE, we have drawn the following two insights:</span></p><p><span>First, the DRAM cache is sufficient and efficient to serve applications. Therefore, when persisting synchronized data to NVM, the focus should be on the efficiency of </span><span>recording</span><span>, rather than </span><span>data retrieval</span><span>. Due to neglecting this, both P2CACHE and SPFS have to create an index for data on NVM for subsequent reads, and have difficulty reducing the space usage on NVM.</span></p><p><span>Second, establishing a well-defined write timing between NVM and disk is crucial for ensuring crash consistency while minimizing the amount of data written to NVM. Due to neglecting this, SPFS and P2CACHE are forced to also redirect async writes to NVM when absorbing sync writes, in order to avoid inconsistencies between the data from sync writes (to NVM) and async writes (to disk).</span></p><p><span>Drawing inspiration from database design, we believe that using NVM as a write-ahead log (WAL) for disk file systems is a more efficient solution. As shown in Figure 2, we designed NVLog to intercept (and only intercept) synchronous calls </span><span>before</span><span> the file system and write the synchronous data to NVM. Then, we transform synchronous write requests into asynchronous ones. This way, any (cache hit) operations on the file system no longer need to wait for disk I/O: for reads and asynchronous writes, data can still be provided by the DRAM cache; for synchronous writes, data is written to both DRAM and NVM in the foreground, while disk writes are offloaded to the background.</span></p></div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item even"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-article-image paragraphs-item-article-image paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-8728" id="article-image-8728">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-article-image field-type-image field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><img src="https://www.usenix.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_embedded/public/arch_new-di__1_ye_new.png" width="862" height="502" alt="" /></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-article-image-caption field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Figure 2.

As such, we record synchronous </span><span>events</span><span> in NVM in an append-only manner </span><span>without indexing</span><span> the data. After a crash, we simply replay the recorded events to restore the data that was supposed to be on disk. This is a key distinction between NVLog and SPFS/P2CACHE: NVLog serves as a lightweight WAL for file system synchronous writes, while SPFS and P2CACHE are inherently heavier file systems. By getting rid of indexing, NVLog provides a higher performance; by only logging synchronous data and allowing us to reclaim expired records on NVM after data is written to disk, NVLog requires less NVM space compared to other approaches.</span></span></p><p><span>While the write-ahead log concept may seem simple, a key difference from database WALs is that NVLog must account for the timing relationship between NVM and underlying disk writes. For databases, it is possible to strictly enforce writing to the WAL before writing to the data area. However, since NVLog is designed as a transparent "intermediate layer" to both the user and the file system, we cannot modify the user interface or the mechanisms for writing back to the disk. Furthermore, because user asynchronous writes, synchronous writes, and DRAM cache flushes to the disk may occur in any order, the data on the disk may be messed up if we simply replay all the NVM records to the disk. We hence provide a mechanism to ensure that data recovered from NVM is always more recent than the disk version, preventing the risk of older data overwriting newer data. </span></p><p>In addition to the designs mentioned above, we also explore efficient log structure and fine-grained synchronous writes in NVLog.

The complete experimental results can be found in our FAST '25 paper; here, we present two representative experiments.</span></p><p><span>First, to demonstrate the applicability of NVLog across a wide range of application scenarios, we designed experiments with varying read-to-write ratios and synchronous-to-asynchronous write ratios under different file systems. We compared the performance of NOVA, SPFS, and NVLog (AS). Note that NVLog (AS) refers to using NVLog but forces all writes to be synchronous, which somewhat represents the performance of P2CACHE.</span></p><p><span>The results are shown in Figure 3. Thanks to our DRAM-NVM cooperative design, NVLog outperforms NVM FS, disk FS, and NVM-based FS accelerators in most cases. In non-sync workloads, by leveraging the DRAM page cache, NVLog performs similarly to its baseline disk FS, achieving speeds up to 3.72x, 2.93x, and 1.24x faster than NOVA, NVLog (AS), and SPFS, respectively. In partial-sync workloads, NVLog outperforms the disk FS, NOVA, and SPFS by up to 4.44x, 2.62x, and 324.11x, respectively. The results show that NVLog consistently maintains a good balance between DRAM and NVM access across various sync levels. Additionally, it is evident that NVLog is the only solution that does not introduce any slowdown to the legacy disk FS.</span></p></div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item odd"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-article-image paragraphs-item-article-image paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-8731" id="article-image-8731">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-article-image field-type-image field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><img src="https://www.usenix.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_embedded/public/perf1.png" width="1440" height="519" alt="" /></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-article-image-caption field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Figure 3.

Even though Shor's algorithm cannot be used today, since there aren't enough physical qubits manufactured so far, it possesses a real threat in the future due to the surveillance strategy known as Store-Now-Decrypt-Later.

This is analogous to classical logic gates such as NOT, AND, OR, which can be combined to define an arbitrary Boolean function.</span></span></span></span></span></p>  <p>As mentioned earlier quantum states can be viewed as points on a 3D unit sphere – the <em>Bloch Sphere</em>. Then 1-qubit gates represent different rotations on the sphere. For example, X, Y, and Z gates known as Pauli gates define 180° rotations of the state on the sphere around the corresponding axes.

If<br /> <span>             </span><span>          </span><span>          </span><span>          </span>|ψ⟩ = α|00⟩ + β|01⟩ + γ|10⟩ + δ|11⟩<br /> then<br /> <span>             </span><span>          </span><span>          </span><span>          </span>CNOT|ψ⟩ = α|00⟩ + β|01⟩ + δ|10⟩ + γ|11⟩</p>  <p>A composition of quantum gates forms a quantum circuit, which is represented as a directed acyclic graph. As traditional Boolean circuits, quantum circuits define quantum computations.</p>  <p>Quantum computing as quantum mechanics itself is alternatively expressed in the linear algebra language of vectors, matrices and operations on them. In linear algebra notation quantum states are described as vectors of amplitudes<br /> <span>         </span><span>          </span><span>          </span><span>         </span>|0⟩ = (1, 0)<sup>†</sup>,   |1⟩ = (0, 1)<sup>†</sup>,   α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ =  (α, β)<sup>†</sup><br /> and quantum operations are represented as unitary matrices. The unitary constraint guarantees that quantum operators produce valid quantum states.</p>  <h2>Universal Quantum Gates</h2>  <p>For classic logic gates one can select a finite set of gates called <span>universal</span>, e.g., {AND, OR, NOT}, composition of which allows defining any Boolean function. The number of quantum gates is infinite, in fact uncountable. In the quantum case a finite set of quantum gates is <em>universal</em> if any quantum operation can be approximated with arbitrary accuracy by a quantum circuit composed of the gates from this set. For example, the set of 1-qubit gates listed earlier plus the CNOT gate is universal.</p>  <h2>Entangled Qubits</h2>  <p>Entanglement is an intrinsic phenomenon of quantum physics and one of the key features of quantum computing. In quantum computing qubits are <em>entangled</em> if their states are correlated. That is, the states depend on each other so that they cannot be changed independently. Rather the entire entangled system evolves as a whole. Since the states of the entangled qubits are correlated so are the results of measurements. Once one qubit randomly collapses into a certain value the other qubits collapse as well into values deterministically dependent on the former.</p>  <p>Unentangled states are called <em>separable</em>. Mathematically it means they can be represented as a product of individual qubit states. Let's consider a two-qubit system and assume that the qubits are in the following states, respectively<br /> <span>             </span><span>          </span><span>          </span><span>          </span><span><span>|ψ<sub>1</sub>⟩ = H|0⟩ = </span></span><span><span>2<sup>-</sup></span></span><sup>½</sup><span><span>(|0⟩ + |1⟩)</span></span><br /> <span>             </span><span>          </span><span>          </span><span>          </span><span><span>|ψ<sub>2</sub>⟩ = |0⟩</span></span></p>  <p><span><span>Then the combined state of the system is the product of the two states and is therefore separable:</span></span><br /> <span>             </span><span>          </span><span>          </span><span>          </span><span><span> </span></span><span><span>|ψ<sub>1</sub>⟩ |ψ<sub>2</sub>⟩ =</span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span>2<sup>-</sup></span></span><sup>½</sup><span><span>(|0⟩ + |1⟩) |0⟩ =</span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span>2<sup>-</sup></span></span><sup>½</sup><span><span>(|00⟩ + |10⟩)</span></span></p>  <p><span><span><span>Multi-qubit gates are used to entangle qubits. For example, if we apply CNOT gate to the above state:</span></span></span><br /> <span>             </span><span>          </span><span>          </span><span>          </span><span><span> </span></span><span><span>CNOT </span></span><span><span>2<sup>-</sup></span></span><sup>½</sup><span><span>(|00⟩ + |10⟩) = </span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span>2<sup>-</sup></span></span><sup>½</sup><span><span>(|00⟩ + |11⟩)<br /> the result is entangled, since it cannot be decomposed into a product of individual qubit states.</span></span></p>  <p>The latter state is known as one the <em>Bell's states</em>. An intrinsic property of this Bell’s state is that when one of the qubits is measured then both qubits collapse and into the same value, which is either |0⟩ or |1⟩ with probability ½. For another entangled Bell's state <span><span> </span></span><span><span>2<sup>-</sup></span></span><sup>½</sup>(|01⟩ + |10⟩) the qubits collapse into opposite states. In both cases the results of measurement are correlated.</p>  <h2>Quantum Computation</h2>  <p>Conceptually the quantum computation process is similar to any computational model. It consists of the following steps</p>  <ol> 	<li> 	<p>Input: prepare qubits initial states. It suffices to initialize qubits into the same state first, say <span>|0⟩</span>, and then transform each into a desired state by applying 1-qubit gates.</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p>Compute: apply a quantum circuit to the qubit system. The circuit is designed to solve the target problem in the first place. Due to the probabilistic nature of the model, it should also intend to maximize the probability of the correct answer when measurements are performed.</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p>Output: measure the states of the qubits. This yields a classical result, which could be passed to classic devices for further processing.</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p>Error check: the obtained results are correct with a certain probability <span>p &gt; ½</span>, which is sufficient in e.g., statistical analysis. If precise computation is required then the obtained result should be verified and if incorrect the quantum computation should be repeated. In practice only a constant repetition of quantum runs is needed.</p> 	</li> </ol>  <p><span><span><span><span>The principles </span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>of the quantum</span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span> computational model differ from the classical.

The computational hardness of factorization made it a principal component of public-key cryptography, where encryption is performed using a public key known to anybody, but decryption is practically impossible without the private key kept in secret. “Practically impossible” here means that decryption without the private key will take millions of years and an enormous amount of compute resources.</span></p>  <h2>Shor’s Algorithm</h2>  <p><span>In 1994 Peter Shor developed a quantum algorithm, which factors an integer with a polynomial runtime upper bound of O(n<sup>3</sup>) where n is the bit length of the number being factored </span>[<a href="#reference-7" title="P.

The World has not produced anywhere near that many qubits yet. In 2023 Atom Computing and IBM announced the first quantum computers with over 1000 qubits.

This is a practical challenge to prove the potential of current quantum computing, different from theoretical asymptotic complexity.</p>  <p>One of the first claims of quantum supremacy was made by Google in 2019. Its Sycamore processor was “used to perform a series of operations in 200 seconds that would take a supercomputer about 10,000 years to complete". The claim was challenged by IBM suggesting that their fastest at the time supercomputer Summit could perform the task in 2.5 days rather than thousands of years. Later, improvements in algorithms reduced the speed of classic execution and allowed it to match or even be less than the 200 seconds runtime of Google’s quantum implementation.</p>  <p>In 2020 a group in the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) announced achieving quantum supremacy on the photonic quantum computer Jiuzhang. The computation performed on Jiuzhang in 200 seconds was estimated to take 600 million years on the fastest supercomputer of the time, Fugaku. The results were further improved later with the USTC’s next-generation quantum computers Jiuzhang 2.0 and Zuchongzhi.</p>  <p>Canadian Xanadu (2022) and US D-Wave Systems (2024) have also reported quantum supremacy. The latest Google’s quantum computer Willow (December 2024) achieved quantum supremacy with logical qubits and error correction.</p>  <p>These results show that quantum computing already demonstrates a tremendous computational power. Although critics of the effort note that the problems used in quantum supremacy experiments are not practical enough and that advancements in classical algorithms and hardware may diminish quantum advantage.</p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item odd"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-8703" id="single-column-text-8703">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Quantum Hardware</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p>Over the last four decades substantial efforts have been devoted to the experimental development of quantum computers. A number of physical realizations were proposed including nuclear magnetic resonance, superconducting, trapped ions, semiconductor quantum dots, photonic, topological quantum computation platforms, and more. Today <span>it is not clear which physical implementation will provide the best qubits and gates.</span></p>  <p><span> </span>Common requirements for quantum hardware are</p>  <ol> 	<li> 	<p>Qubits: an adequate representation of quantum states.</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p>An implementation of a universal set of quantum gates.</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p>A reliable qubit state initialization.</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p>Quantum state measurement.</p> 	</li> </ol>  <h2>Qubit Coherence</h2>  <p>Theoretical quantum computation deals with ideal qubits and genuine quantum operators, but in all current physical realizations qubits and quantum gates are unreliable due to <em>quantum noise</em> and the law of <span>entropy</span>. In quantum systems interaction with the environment causes state <em>decoherence</em>, which leads to information loss and computation errors. This is similar to classic mechanical systems where energy is lost due to various types of friction being converted to heat. High coherence of qubits can be achieved by isolation of qubits. The majority of today's quantum computers run at cryogenic temperatures in order to minimize interaction with the environment. But they cannot be completely isolated since operations and measurements need to be performed on them. This is one of the tradeoffs of experimental quantum computers design.</p>  <p><em>Coherence rates</em> of existing qubits range from fractions of a second to hours. This limits the computation time, since when qubits lose coherence their states become random i.e. meaningless. Individual quantum gate execution times also vary depending on the realization. Dividing the qubit coherence time by the gate execution latency gives us the number of operations that a quantum computer is limited to for meaningful results. The computational capability can be extended by increasing the lifetime of qubits and by optimizing gate latency.</p>  <h2>Quantum Gate Fidelity</h2>  <p>Physical quantum gates are devices that emit different types of fields depending on the hardware platform to alter the quantum state of qubits. Quantum gates are also prone to errors due to quantum noise. Gate <em>fidelity</em> characterizes the reliability of quantum gates. It measures the precision of a physical gate compared to the ideal gate. Sequential execution of gates leads to error accumulation so that long chains of gates become unreliable. Therefore, shallow quantum circuits are preferred for lower error rates.</p>  <h2>Scalability</h2>  <p>The primary challenge of practical Quantum Computing is <em>scalability</em>, that is the ability to connect a large number of qubits without losing system reliability / coherence. A reasonable application of Shor’s algorithm as stated earlier requires 20 million qubits <span><span><span>[<a href="#reference-19" title="[19] C. Gidney, M. Ekerå, “How to factor 2048 bit RSA integers in 8 hours using 20 million noisy qubits,” 2021">19</a>]</span></span></span>. Keeping such a large number of qubits entangled, which provides parallelism in quantum computation, and being able to control them with low error rates is a hard engineering and scientific problem.</p>  <h2>Quantum Error Correction</h2>  <p>Mitigation <span><span>of decoherence effects </span></span>is possible with the <em>quantum error correction</em> (QEC) technique introduced by Shor. In 1995 he presented a nine-qubit quantum error-correcting code [<span>9</span>]. In classic computing, error correction can be done using redundancy. This is not possible in the quantum world due to the no-cloning theorem, which states that an arbitrary qubit state cannot be cloned.</p>  <p>An ensemble of error correcting physical qubits represents a single <em>logical qubit</em>. The state of the logical qubit is shared between entangled physical qubits so that the logical state remains correct even if physical qubits are corrupted. Logical qubits are the building blocks of future fault tolerant quantum computing.</p>  <p>Critics of QEC raise concerns that logical qubits are still not perfect, that it requires too many physical qubits to mitigate errors with existing noisy quantum systems, and advocate for developing new QEC schemes.</p>  <p>Practical quantum computing has many fascinating hard problems that are being solved today or waiting to be solved or discovered. It is a fast evolving and well-funded area of research and engineering.</p>  <h4><em>Low qubit coherence times and noisy quantum gates pose a major obstacle for practical quantum computing.

Particularly, their values cannot be reassigned or passed in a function by value due to the non-cloning theorem. Classical loops and if statements are used to control quantum computation and simplify the description of quantum circuits.</p>  <p>A quantum program is then compiled to a quantum circuit. Since different quantum processors have different sets of universal quantum gates, the compiled circuit is further translated into hardware supported quantum gates and instructions of the physical quantum device for execution.

QCSs were developed when physical quantum devices were unavailable. QCS uses brute-force calculation of the evolution of quantum states. Since the amount of information grows exponentially with the number of qubits, classical simulators are limited by the computational power of classic computers.</p>  <p>QCSs are not a replacement for a physical quantum computer, but they play an important role in quantum computing as they allow real-time debugging of quantum algorithms, which is problematic with real quantum devices since one cannot check qubit states in the middle of a quantum computation. QCSs are widely used for developing new algorithms, as well as testing, debugging, and education frameworks.</p>  <p>There are numerous quantum simulators out there. Examples of hardware-optimized simulators that utilize multi-core CPUs and GPUs are <a href="https://github.com/iqusoft/intel-qs"><span><span>Intel-QS</span></span></a> and <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuquantum-sdk"><span><span>NVIDIA cuQuantum</span></span></a>.</p>  <h2>Quantum Memory and Storage</h2>  <p>In von Neumann’s architecture, traditional computers have the central processing unit (CPU), volatile random access memory (RAM), and persistent long-term storage. The quantum circuit model does not assume memory. Rather qubits’ initial states are set up on the initialization stage, then a quantum circuit is executed, and the output is obtained by measurements.</p>  <p>Quantum memory, that is a system for storing and retrieving quantum states, is hard to build because of the no-cloning theorem and short qubit coherence times. Classical RAM stores information by creating a copy of it, which is not possible for quantum states. Also, information in RAM lives as long as the computer is on, while qubits susceptible to decoherence cannot hold quantum states long.</p>  <p>In 2008 a technique for <em>Quantum Random Access Memory</em> (QRAM) was suggested by V. Giovannetti, S. Lloyd, and L. Maccone called Bucket-Brigade [<a href="#reference-25" title="V. Giovannetti, S. Lloyd, L. Maccone, “Quantum random access memory,” Physical review letters, 100 16, 2008"><span>25</span></a>], which uses a binary tree of qubits for addressing the memory with the leaf nodes serving as the memory cells. Error correction is used to increase coherence times.</p>  <p>Quantum long-term storage would be an interesting device. The amount of information stored in qubits grows exponentially on the number of qubits. “Quantum state drives” may be a very compact way of storing information. Unfortunately, such technology does not yet exist.</p>  <p>There is a vast amount of quantum software developed, which seems just waiting to be utilized when scalable and reliable quantum computers arrive. On the other hand,</p>  <h4><em>The state of the art of quantum software for gate-model quantum computers is still at the level of an assembly language with evident enhancement features but provides little towards higher-level abstractions.<br /> Further proliferation of quantum software is expected as high-level quantum programming languages are still yet to be developed.</em></h4> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item odd"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-8705" id="single-column-text-8705">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Challenges of Quantum Computing</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p>So far it was shown that quantum computers are based on a more powerful computational model than classic computing, promising exponential acceleration in computational power for various tasks. Returning to the question raised in the beginning – why Quantum Computing is an elusive ever-shifting target, this section will summarize the main challenges of Quantum Computing and let you answer this question for yourself.</p>  <h2>Quantum Devices</h2>  <p>Production of physical quantum devices is a major theoretical and technological challenge. It faces the following major problems:</p>  <ol> 	<li> 	<p><em>Reliability</em>: lowering error rates, increasing qubit coherence time, and improving gate fidelity<span>.</span></p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p><em>Scalability</em>: practical quantum computation requires millions of qubits. More qubits mean higher compound error rates and the higher complexity of maintaining the state of interconnected qubits.</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p><em>Fault-Tolerance</em>: error-correction is imperative for building logical qubits – the core building blocks of resilient quantum devices.</p> 	</li> 	<li> 	<p><em>Cost</em>: present quantum computers are custom manufactured. Most of them operate at very low temperatures requiring costly cooling systems and use of other expensive equipment.</p> 	</li> </ol>  <p>Production of reliable quantum devices depends on solving these problems. Multiple approaches exist today for physical realization of quantum computers, each having its pros and cons. It may take time to find the winner and work out a mass-production technology.</p>  <h2>Quantum Algorithm Design</h2>  <p><span>Existing quantum algorithms already show drastic acceleration of classic computing for several important classes of problems. Since quantum algorithms are based on different principles and can be more powerful than the classical, a new series of algorithms is still waiting to be invented that take advantage of properties of the quantum model. Not all algorithms will benefit from the quantum approach. For example, comparison-based quantum sorting will remain lower bounded by Ω(n log n) the same as in classic <span>[<a href="#reference-26" title="P. Høyer, J. Neerbek, Y.

Knuth, “The Art of Computer Programming,” Addison-Wesley.">30</a>] for classic computing.</span></span></p>  <h2>High-Level Quantum Programming</h2>  <p>Today’s quantum programming is based on the quantum gate model, which is essentially a low-level assembler language since it is so closely tied up to the machine code instructions. Classic computing also started with <span>logic gates and relay switching circuits [</span><span><a href="#reference-31" title="C. E. Shannon, “A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits,” Trans. AIEE. 57 12, 713–723, 1938">31</a></span><span>] before they were replaced by vacuum tubes, then transistors, and integrated circuits. It took decades to level up the abstractions. The same should inevitably happen with quantum programming. For example, one can fantasize that quantum parallelism will be represented with a special construct in the language, which will be compiled into a circuit entangling qubits with multi-qubit gates. Such high-level abstractions do not exist yet, </span>and need<span> to be invented.</span></p> </div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item even"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-8706" id="single-column-text-8706">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Conclusion</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p>Quantum Computing is an exciting and fast evolving area of research, engineering, and technology.

Behind the scenes, Google’s services  have increased dramatically in scale over the last 25 years — and failures have become rarer even as the scale has grown. Google’s SRE team has pioneered methods to keep failures rare by engineering reliability into every part of the stack. SREs have scaled up methods that have gotten us very far—Service Level Objectives (SLOs), error budgets, isolation strategies, thorough postmortems, progressive rollouts, and other techniques. In the face of increasing system complexity and emerging challenges, we at Google are always asking ourselves: what's next? How can we continue to push the boundaries of reliability and safety?</span></p><p><span>To address these challenges, Google SRE has embraced systems theory and control theory. We have adopted the STAMP (System-Theoretic Accident Model and Processes) framework, developed by Professor Nancy Leveson at MIT, which shifts the focus from preventing individual component failures to understanding and managing complex system interactions. STAMP incorporates tools like Causal Analysis based on Systems Theory (CAST) for post-incident investigations and System-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) for hazard analysis.</span></p><p><span>In this article, we will explore the limitations of our traditional approaches and introduce you to STAMP. Through a real-world case study and lessons learned, we'll show you why we believe STAMP represents the future of SRE not just at Google, but across the tech industry.</span></p></div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item even"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-8578" id="single-column-text-8578">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Making systems theory practical</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p><span>Ideas like error budgets worked well with products that were largely stateless web services, but today our products have losses that must </span><span>never</span><span> occur—error budgets of zero. The types of failures we need to prevent have evolved beyond what error budgets can effectively address. Issues like privacy breaches, data loss, and regulatory compliance demand absolute prevention, not just low frequency and rapid mitigation. In addition to  these elevated expectations, our systems also become more complex every year. Sophisticated automation has enabled us to scale, AI and ML are now core to almost every product we build, and cost and energy efficiency are as important as user-visible features.</span></p><p><span>SRE has always worked to not simply react to failures, but to anticipate and prevent them. But anticipating failures has proven wickedly difficult at Google, a system defined by one of the largest codebases in history. And AI is only increasing this challenge. How can SREs comprehend and manage the ever-increasing complexity of our systems, anticipate potential failures before they occur, and design safer, more reliable systems from the ground up?</span></p><p><span>The answer lies in a paradigm shift. Systems theory, control theory, and their application to solving problems through systems-thinking gives SREs a way to understand and manage complexity, all the way up to Google’s planet-scale systems. The future of SRE will use system-theoretic methods to provide comprehensive, efficient, and effective results in the AI-era.</span></p><p><span>The easiest way to introduce this new model is to contrast it with the way we traditionally thought about our systems. In general, any hazard analysis method consists of three parts:</span></p><ul><li><p><span>A way to model the system</span></p></li><li><p><span>A way to explain how problems occur (a theory of causation)</span></p></li><li><p><span>A search algorithm</span></p></li></ul><p><span>Although we never formalized it with theory, SRE has developed an effective method for analyzing hazards in our systems. Like every software engineering organization, we depend on accurate </span><span>software architecture models</span><span> to understand how things work. These models are often </span><span>data flow</span><span> models, showing how network requests or data move between different parts of the system.</span></p><p><span>This modeling technique gives rise to a common default of </span><span>cause-and-effect reasoning </span><span>to explain how problems might occur. We think deeply about dependencies in a linear data flow model — reliable operations come from careful management of dependencies. We use SLOs to understand the reliability guarantees of different components in a system, and ensure that those guarantees meet or exceed the caller’s requirements.</span></p><p><span>Finally, we commonly use </span><span>induction</span><span> to search for hazards. Induction, or bottoms-up reasoning from discrete events to general patterns, is how we approach writing the action items in a postmortem. We ask postmortem authors to think beyond repairing the one incident to what might prevent an entire class of incidents. We leverage postmortems to identify patterns and trends across Google. We ask SRE teams to do the same thing with their operational interrupts. A goal of SRE is to transform discrete alerts into engineering solutions that eliminate the cause of the problem altogether.</span></p><p><span>These practices have been instrumental in our ability to maintain reliability while scaling our operations to serve billions of users daily. They've allowed us to learn from failures, improve our systems incrementally, and build a culture of reliability across the organization.</span></p><p><span>However, we've seen our systems get more complex every year, and data flow models don’t scale to our enormous complexity. Without a consistent way to use abstraction, RPC diagrams and software architecture models become too complex to analyze, and are almost always either incomplete or out of date. </span></p><p><span>These kinds of models also provide no information about the dynamics of the system. </span></p><ul><li><p><span>Which RPCs can initiate a flow? </span></p></li><li><p><span>How do errors propagate? </span></p></li><li><p><span>Which components could cause a critical outage? Which can only cause minor issues? </span></p></li><li><p><span>What if one component interaction is safe in some contexts, but unsafe in others?</span></p></li><li><p><span>What is the overall goal that the system is trying to achieve? </span></p></li><li><p><span>What responsibility does each component in the system have with respect to that overall goal? </span></p></li></ul><p><span>Looking at a data flow diagram with more than 100 nodes is overwhelming—where do you even begin to search for flaws? Even more insidious are flaws that occurred at the requirements definition phase of the system's construction. </span><span>A design might implement its requirements flawlessly. But what if requirements necessary for the system to be safe were incorrect or, even worse, missing altogether?</span><span> </span></p><p><span>Learning from failures doesn’t necessarily help you anticipate and prevent something that has never happened. Inductive reasoning is powerful when there is a lot of data to draw from, but we work very hard to </span><span>prevent</span><span> failures that are often the source of that data.</span></p><p><span>In general, our approach to reliability over the last fifteen years has aimed at ensuring that our systems behave correctly and consistently according to the way we designed it.</span></p><p><span>The future of SRE, leveraging systems thinking, will address a second and even more fundamental question: is </span><span>“the way we designed it” </span><span>correct? Answering this question requires a new approach.</span></p></div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item odd"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-8579" id="single-column-text-8579">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Overview of STAMP</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p><span>The first time system designs challenged their creators' ability to understand them was in the early twentieth century. Sophisticated guidance systems, electronic computers, rockets, and radars all pushed engineers beyond what the traditional tools of component analysis, manual adjustments based on observed outputs, and trial and error could handle. In response, a new field emerged at the intersection of mathematics, engineering, and systems thinking: control theory. Today, as we navigate an increasingly complex world of autonomous systems, adaptive networks, and AI- and ML-powered systems, the principles of control theory developed in those formative post-war years continue to provide the theoretical backbone for managing and optimizing systems across diverse fields.</span></p><p>Leveson's groundbreaking work on STAMP in the early 2000s represented a paradigm shift in system safety. Building upon the foundations laid by cybernetics pioneer Norbert Wiener and control theorists like Rudolf Kalman, Leveson recognized that safety is an emergent property that can only be analyzed at the system-level, rather than an attribute of individual system components. STAMP applies control theory principles to safety engineering, viewing accidents not as a chain of events, but as complex interactions between system components, including human operators and software. Today, Leveson's STAMP methodology offers a robust framework for understanding and mitigating risks in complex socio-technical systems, demonstrating the enduring relevance and adaptability of control theory principles in our rapidly evolving technological landscape.</p></div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item even"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-8580" id="single-column-text-8580">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Control Theory as a Foundation - The Four Conditions</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p><span>In "An Introduction to Cybernetics," W.R. Ashby lays out the fundamental requirements for control, which Leveson later incorporated into her STAMP methodology.

As we'll show, this type of causality model has limitations when analyzing system safety. Sentences like, "a bug combined with insufficient rate limits, caused thousands of servers to go offline" abound in our postmortems. We don't explicitly call out our use of a linear chain causality model, but as Leveson writes, "accident models explain why accidents occur, and they determine the approaches we take to prevent them. While you might not be consciously aware you are using a model when engaged in these activities, some (perhaps subconscious) model of the phenomenon is always part of the process." (Leveson 2012, 15) </span></p><p><span>Many problems stem from choosing an inadequate causality model. If we see outages as the result of a branching chain of events then the obvious solution is to break the chain before the failure. This will inevitably lead us to look for where some component failed—where the software had a bug, or a server crashed, or was overloaded with traffic—and work to prevent that failure. We'll add redundancy, or rework the server to be more reliable, or introduce failure isolation, or add tests to catch problems. These techniques will all work, but only up to a point. We haven't addressed any of the larger systemic factors that might reintroduce the problems somewhere else. We have only looked at relationships that are directly related to the outage. Also, picking the first event in the chain (the "root cause") is subjective. When did the outage really begin? When the servers went offline? Or when the rate limits were changed? Or when the bug was introduced? Or when the maintenance operation was first automated? There is an infinite regress problem here.</span></p><p><span>STAMP shifts our perspective on accidents from a linear chain of failure events to a control problem. We want our model to explain accidents that result from component failures (like server crashes and buggy automation), but also external disturbances (environmental factors in our datacenters or subsea Internet cables), interactions between components of the system (including human-human, human-software, and software-software interactions), and also incorrect or inadequate behavior of individual system components—flawed algorithms or decision making.</span></p><p><span>Instead of asking "What software service failed?" we ask “What interactions between parts of the system were inadequately controlled?” In complex systems, most accidents result from interactions between components that are all functioning as designed, but collectively produce an unsafe state. </span><span>If this all seems abstract, don't worry</span><span>—</span><span>we're going to tie these concepts together with a real-life example.</span></p></div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item even"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-8582" id="single-column-text-8582">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Hazard states give you time</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p>Another incredibly important implication of an accident model is that it helps you analyze the time dimension of an accident. In a linear chain, there is a sequence of events laid out over time, but it only describes two states that the system can be in—normal operations, before the last event in the chain occurs and the system has not yet had an accident, and loss operations, after the last event in the chain occurs and the accident begins. </p></div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item odd"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-article-image paragraphs-item-article-image paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-8583" id="article-image-8583">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-article-image field-type-image field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><img src="https://www.usenix.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_embedded/public/1.png" width="1248" height="274" alt="" /></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-article-image-caption field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Control flow of a system without hazard states</div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item even"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-8584" id="single-column-text-8584">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p><span>The transition from normal operations to loss operations is typically very sudden—there is almost no time to react to prevent it. This is one reason why SRE uses a combination of </span><span>fast burn</span><span> and </span><span>slow burn</span><span> SLOs for detecting problems that might be developing but aren't yet at the point of causing real harm. However, these SLOs are normally attributes of individual system components.  </span></p><p><span>STAMP formalizes this concept at the system level as </span><span>hazard states</span><span>. "A hazard is a system state or set of conditions that, together with a particular set of worst-case environmental conditions, will lead to a loss [for one or more stakeholders in the system]."</span><span> (STPA Handbook, 17)</span></p><p><span><span>Hazard states are not discrete events. They do not describe anything at the individual system component-level. A hazard state is a property of the system as a whole, and the system can be in a hazard state for a long period of time before an accident occurs. That gives engineers a much larger target to aim at when trying to prevent outages. Rather than trying to eliminate any single failure that could occur anywhere in the system, we work to prevent the system from entering a hazard state. And if we do enter a hazard state, </span><span>if we can detect it and take action to transition from the hazard state back to normal operations</span><span>, we can prevent any accident from occurring. In some cases, the system is in a hazard state for a long time—a bug is introduced but never triggered, an alert fires but no one receives it, a server is underprovisioned but suddenly receives traffic from a popular new product feature, etc. </span></span></p></div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item odd"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-article-image paragraphs-item-article-image paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-8585" id="article-image-8585">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-article-image field-type-image field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><img src="https://www.usenix.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_embedded/public/2.png" width="1248" height="262" alt="" /></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-article-image-caption field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Diagram showing process flow from Normal operations on left through Hazard state in center to Loss Operations on Right</div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item even"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-8586" id="single-column-text-8586">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Making it concrete with a real example</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p><span>An example of this phenomenon occurred at Google in 2021. We set and enforce resource quotas for some kinds of internal software running on our infrastructure. To maximize efficiency, we also monitor how much of its quota each software service uses. If a service consistently uses less resources than its quota, we automatically reduce the quota. In STPA terms, this quota rightsizer has a control action to reduce a service's quota. From a safety perspective, we then ask when this action would be unsafe. As one example, if the rightsizer  ever reduced a service's quota below the actual needs of that service, it would be unsafe—the service would be resource-starved. This is what STPA calls an </span><span>unsafe control action</span><span> (UCA).</span></p><p><span>STPA analyzes each interaction in a system to determine comprehensively how the interaction must be controlled in order for the system to be safe. Unsafe control actions lead to the system entering one or more hazard states. There are only four possible types of UCA:</span></p><ol><li><p><span>A required control action is not provided.</span></p></li><li><p><span>An incorrect or inadequate control action is provided.</span></p></li><li><p><span>A control action is provided at the wrong time or in the wrong sequence.</span></p></li><li><p><span>A control action is stopped too soon or applied for too long.</span></p></li></ol><p><span>This particular unsafe control action—reducing an assigned quota to be less than what the service requires—is an example of the second type of UCA.</span></p><p><span>Simply identifying this unsafe control action by itself is only partially useful. If "quota rightsizer reduces the assigned quota under what the service requires" is unsafe, then preventing that behavior is what the system must do, i.e. "quota rightsizer must not reduce the assigned quota under what the service currently requires." This is a </span><span>safety requirement</span><span>. Safety requirements can be very useful for formulating future designs, elaborating testing plans, and helping people understand the system. And let’s be honest—even mature software systems can operate in ways that are undocumented, unclear, and surprising.</span></p><p><span>Nonetheless, what we really want is to anticipate all of the concrete scenarios that lead to a hazard state. Again, STPA has a simple and comprehensive way to structure an analysis to find all of the scenarios that could lead the quota rightsizer to violate this safety requirement.</span></p><p><span>So in the case of the rightsizer, there are four archetypal scenarios that we can investigate.</span></p><ol><li><p><span>Scenarios in which the rightsizer has incorrect behavior.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Scenarios in which the rightsizer gets incorrect feedback (or no feedback at all).</span></p></li><li><p><span>Scenarios in which the quota system never receives an action from the rightsizer (even though the rightsizer tried to send one).</span></p></li><li><p><span>Scenarios in which the quota system has incorrect behavior.</span></p></li></ol><p><span>One specific scenario quickly jumped out to us when analyzing the rightsizer. It gets feedback on the current resource usage from the quota service. As implemented, the calculation of current resource usage is complicated, involving different data collectors and some tricky aggregation logic. What if something went wrong with this complex calculation, resulting in a value that was too low? In short, the rightsizer would react exactly as designed and reliably shrink a service’s quota to the incorrect lower usage level. </span></p><p><span>Exactly the disaster we wanted to prevent. </span></p><p><span>Up to this point, lots of attention had been paid to getting the quota adjustment algorithm right and reliably producing the correct outputs, namely, the action to adjust a service’s quota. However, the feedback path—including the service’s current resource usage—had been less well understood. </span></p><p><span>This highlights a major advantage of STPA—by looking at the system level and by modeling the system in terms of control-feedback loops, we find issues both in the control path and the feedback path. As we run STPA on more and more systems, we see that the feedback path is often less well understood than the control path, but just as important from a system safety perspective.</span></p><p><span>As we dug into the feedback paths for the rightsizer, we saw many opportunities to improve them. None of these changes looked like a traditional reliability solution—it didn’t boil down to managing the rightsizer with a different SLO and error budget. Instead, the solutions showed up in other parts of the system and involved redesigning parts of the stack that had previously appeared to be unrelated–again, an advantage of STPA’s system theory approach.</span></p><p><span>In the 2021 incident, incorrect feedback about the resources used by a critical service in Google's infrastructure was sent to the rightsizer. The rightsizer calculated a new quota, allocating far fewer resources than the service was actually using. As a precautionary measure, this quota reduction was not immediately applied, but was held for several weeks to give time for someone to intervene in case the quota was wrong. </span></p><p><span>Of course, major incidents are never simple events—the next problem was that despite adding the delay as a safety feature, feedback about the pending change was never sent to anyone. The entire system was in a hazard state for weeks, but because we weren't looking for it, we missed our chance to prevent the loss that followed. After several weeks, the quota reduction was applied resulting in a significant outage. Using STPA, we have anticipated problems just like this one in many different systems across Google.</span></p><p><span><span>As Leveson writes in </span><span>Engineering a Safer World</span><span>: "In [STAMP], understanding why an accident occurred requires determining why the control was ineffective. Preventing future accidents requires shifting from a focus on preventing failures to the broader goal of designing and implementing controls that will enforce the necessary constraints."</span><span> This shift in perspective - from trying to prove the absence of problems to effectively managing known and potential hazards - is a key principle in our system safety approach.</span></span></p></div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item odd"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-article-image paragraphs-item-article-image paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-8587" id="article-image-8587">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-article-image field-type-image field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><img src="https://www.usenix.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_embedded/public/3.png" width="500" height="524" alt="" /></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-article-image-caption field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Control Flow of The Rightsizer quota-management system</div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item even"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-8588" id="single-column-text-8588">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">Where We Are Heading</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-single-column-text field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd"><p><span>Rather than seeing complexity as a bug, SRE teams at Google are leveraging control theory and methods like STPA and CAST to lead us to more comprehensive and proactive approaches to reliability, moving beyond simply reacting to failures to actively designing safer systems from the ground up.</span></p><p><span>We have analyzed some of Google's most complex systems with STPA, and with relatively little effort (think: engineer-weeks of work per analysis), we have found hundreds of scenarios with a wide range of impacts. Because we found these scenarios before they led to an outage, we were able to mitigate them with a combination of quick "band-aid" fixes and much more carefully planned software engineering, leveraging the regular planning process across Google to make the system safer while also minimizing the costs and disruptions associated with the work. Our ongoing work is focused on extremely complex Google Cloud systems, Google's massive internal networking systems, and multiple Google products.</span></p><p><span>The success of SRE at Google has always been due to the amazingly talented engineers who have worked 24/7 to ensure that Google's products work at scale. Dedication, ingenuity, and lots of hard work have made Google's products the benchmark for high reliability and performance. The evolution of SRE towards system safety methods gives our engineers an entirely new way to understand the systems we build, and provides us even stronger guarantees about how they work. Complexity is increasing everywhere, and Google's engineers will be ready to face it in order to provide the same exceptional performance in the next era.</span></p></div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div></div></div>

The </span><strong>education portal (EDU) </strong><span>enables teachers to create accounts for their students, to manage these accounts, to upload materials for class use, and to assign work to students to be completed on SPHERE. Such work usually comes in the form of homework assignments that require students to create attack and defense scenarios in mini-networks on SPHERE. This facilitates active learning, promotes student engagement and also teaches practical skills, which students will need in their future careers. Students also use the EDU portal to access materials for their class. The </span><strong>human study (HUM) </strong><span>portal </span><span>helps researchers that run human user studies to deploy their innovations on SPHERE, and create pathways for study participants to interact with these innovations and leave feedback for researchers. The </span><span><strong>artifact evaluation committee (AEC)</strong> portal</span><span> helps artifact authors and reviewers share and evaluate artifacts for a given paper on the same common infrastructure.

Even though some research solutions can be accurately evaluated in this setting, we argue that there are multiple reasons why evaluation on a common research infrastructure, such as SPHERE, brings substantial added benefits to the researcher and to the entire research community. </span></p><p><span>First, SPHERE will offer the scale and diversity of hardware, including most modern devices, that are beyond reach of many labs and university datacenters, along with a dedicated, responsive staff to provide user support. </span></p><p><span>Second, SPHERE will offer reproducibility support and processes to promote wider artifact sharing and reuse. Thus users that release their artifacts on SPHERE are likely to see these artifacts reused by others, increasing visibility and impact of their research.  </span></p><p><span>Third, SPHERE will offer access to datasets, experimental tools, representative experimental scenarios and research artifacts shared by other users. These products will allow for easy experiment setup, where the researcher augments an existing, complex scenario instead of building the entire experiment from scratch. Artifact sharing further allows for head to head comparison between new and existing research products in same evaluation scenarios, which is necessary for research publications. </span></p><p><span>Finally, artifact sharing allows researchers to extend and enhance work of their peers, propelling the overall research community towards more sophisticated, more realistic and efficient solutions, which can more quickly transition to practice.</span></p></div></div></div>  </div> </div> </div><div class="field-item odd"><div class="paragraphs-item paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-single-column-text paragraphs-item-full paragraphs-item-8628" id="single-column-text-8628">         <div class="content">     <div class="field field-name-field-single-column-sub field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items field-items"><div class="field-item odd">5.
