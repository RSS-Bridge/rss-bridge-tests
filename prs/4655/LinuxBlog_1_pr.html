Firstly, it saves money. ISPs often charge monthly fees to rent their modem or router. Buying your own equipment has an upfront cost but saves money in the long run by eliminating rental fees. In some regions providers must allow approved third-party modems, allowing you to avoid these extra fees.</p> <p>Secondly, as mentioned in the beginning of this article, ISP-provided routers may not offer the latest Wi-Fi 7 technology, the strongest signal, or multigig LAN ports. Upgrading to a newer router often results in improved Wi-Fi coverage and network performance.</p> <p>Another reason is to gain access to advanced settings that ISP routers often hide or don’t support. Features like detailed advanced firewall, parental controls, guest networks, Quality of Service (QoS) bandwidth management, and client/server VPN support are commonly available on retail and open-source routers.</p> <p>Also, for better device security. Third-party or open-source routers frequently receive firmware updates directly from the manufacturer or community. In contrast, ISP routers are usually not be updated promptly or sometimes not updated at all.</p> <p>Linux and open-source enthusiasts can install open-source firmware like <a href="https://openwrt.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenWrt</a>, <a href="https://dd-wrt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DD-WRT</a>, <a href="https://opnsense.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OPNsense</a>, or <a href="https://www.pfsense.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pfSense</a> on compatible hardware for even more functionality. This might include ad-blocking or dynamic routing protocols. You can do this even using <a href="https://linuxblog.io/choosing-the-perfect-network-firewall-device-for-under-300/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">your own hardware appliance as your router</a>.</p> <p>If you prefer proprietary solutions, you can replace gear with solutions like a <a href="https://store.ui.com/us/en/category/all-cloud-gateways" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unifi Cloud Gateway</a>, <a href="https://firewalla.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firewalla</a>, <a href="https://www.sophos.com/en-us/free-tools/sophos-xg-firewall-home-edition" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sophos XG Home</a>, or others.</p> <p>Of course, when you replace the ISP’s hardware, you become responsible for managing your network. You’ll need to configure and troubleshoot your equipment (the ISP’s support becomes limited to only when their line is down). For most users this is manageable, but it’s a trade-off to be aware of.</p> <p>Now, let’s look at how to approach replacing the ISP hardware for different connection types.</p> <h2><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Cable_vs_DSL_vs_Fiber_Internet_Connections"></span>Cable vs. DSL vs. Fiber Internet Connections<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2> <p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20880 size-large" title="Cable, DSL, and fiber internet cables, showing physical differences between each connection type." src="https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Cable_vs_DSL_vs_Fiber_Internet-868x579.png" alt="Cable, DSL, and fiber internet cables, showing physical differences between each connection type." width="868" height="579" srcset="https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Cable_vs_DSL_vs_Fiber_Internet-868x579.png 868w, https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Cable_vs_DSL_vs_Fiber_Internet-300x200.png 300w, https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Cable_vs_DSL_vs_Fiber_Internet-560x373.png 560w" sizes="auto"  loading="lazy" fetchpriority="low"/></p> <p>Before you buy any new hardware for your home network, identify what type of internet service you have. The process for replacing equipment differs if you have cable, fiber, or DSL. The physical medium—coaxial cable, fiber-optic, or telephone line (DSL)—determines whether you need a modem and a router, or just a router.</p> <p>Below we explain each ISP connection type and how you can use your own router or modem in each case. We won&#8217;t go into detail on less popular wireless mobile (LTE or 5G) and satellite ISP connections. But the same principles apply. In my case, I used a <a href="https://linuxblog.io/peplink-balance-20x-router-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peplink Balance 20x</a> to replace my ISP&#8217;s LTE modem for internet connectivity.

Many ISP-supplied cable modems also include built-in Wi-Fi router functionality (forming a gateway). Users can choose to replace the entire gateway or put the ISP device in <a href="https://www.xfinity.com/support/articles/wireless-gateway-enable-disable-bridge-mode" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bridge mode</a> and use a separate router.</p> <p>If your internet comes through coax, you have cable broadband. The device your ISP gave you is either a cable modem (if it has one Ethernet WAN port) or a cable gateway (modem plus router/Wi-Fi in one box).</p> <p>The modem handles communication with the cable company (ISP) over a coax cable, while the router (if integrated) distributes that connection to your devices via Ethernet and/or Wi-Fi. You can use your own router by disabling the ISP modem’s Wi-Fi and ignoring its LAN ports, but the better solution is to replace the modem as well. This eliminates the ISP box entirely, giving you full control and ending rental fees.</p> <p>Check with your cable ISP for approved modem models. Most <a href="https://www.spectrum.net/support/internet/compliant-modems-charter-network" target="_blank" rel="noopener">providers</a> and <a href="https://help.motorolanetwork.com/kb/general/cable-service-providers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">modem manufacturers</a> maintain a <a href="https://kb.netgear.com/000063930/Which-ISPs-are-compatible-with-my-NETGEAR-cable-modem-or-cable-modem-router" target="_blank" rel="noopener">list of compatible modems</a>. Ensure the modem supports at least DOCSIS 3.0 or 3.1, depending on your plan’s speed. For gigabit cable plans, a DOCSIS 3.1 modem is required. Buying a modem that’s on an approved list and supports your speed tier is essential; otherwise, your ISP might refuse to activate it!</p> <h4><span class="ez-toc-section" id="How_to_replace_your_cable_modem"></span>How to replace your cable modem<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h4> <p>Replacing a cable modem is straightforward. First, note the new modem’s MAC address (a unique ID printed on the device). Disconnect the old device and hook up the coax cable and power to your new modem. Once it’s powered and connected, you typically need to activate it with the ISP so they register its MAC address on their network.</p> <p>Many ISPs offer a <a href="https://www.cox.com/residential/support/activating-a-new-modem-or-gateway.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">self-activation webpage</a> or phone line for this purpose. For example, <a href="https://www.xfinity.com/support/articles/activate-xfi-gateway-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Comcast Xfinity</a> and <a href="https://www.spectrum.net/support/internet/self-install-internet-wifi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spectrum</a> have web portals where you log in and follow steps to add a new modem. Alternatively, you may call customer support and provide the modem’s MAC and your account details for activation. After a short synchronization, the modem should come online.</p> <p>Once the modem is online, connect your personal router’s WAN (Internet) port to the modem’s WAN port. Your router should receive a public IP address from the ISP (via DHCP) if everything is configured correctly (with the ISP’s gateway removed or in bridge mode). If the modem you bought is a standalone (no built-in Wi-Fi), using your own router is required for home networking.</p> <p>If you were renting the ISP’s modem, don’t forget to return it once your own is working. Most ISPs will stop charging a monthly fee when their equipment is returned.</p> <h4><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Keep_the_cable_modem_but_add_your_own_router"></span>Keep the cable modem but add your own router<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h4> <p>If you cannot buy a new modem (or choose not to), you can still use your own router by putting the ISP’s gateway into bridge mode. Bridge mode turns off the ISP&#8217;s device routing/NAT functions and passes the public IP through to your router.</p> <p>Every ISP gateway’s interface is different, but look for a “Bridge Mode” or “Passthrough” setting in its admin pages. If bridge mode is unavailable, a workaround is to use the ISP device’s DMZ feature to expose your router, or at worst, accept a double NAT. (Double NAT means your router is behind the ISP router; it usually still lets you browse the web fine, but complicates certain advanced applications. It’s a last resort if the ISP locks down their gear.)</p> <h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="DSL_Internet_Phone_Line_DSL"></span>DSL Internet (Phone Line DSL)<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3> <p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-20884" src="https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DSL_modem_ports-868x511.png" alt="" width="868" height="511" srcset="https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DSL_modem_ports-868x511.png 868w, https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DSL_modem_ports-300x176.png 300w, https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DSL_modem_ports-560x329.png 560w" sizes="auto"  fetchpriority="low"/></p> <p><em>Note: If you have DSL, you are probably better off upgrading to a fiber or even cable ISP, rather than spending money on DSL hardware, as it is the oldest and most limiting of the three technologies.</em></p> <p>DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) runs over telephone lines. It uses a DSL modem to connect. While less common now (many regions have upgraded to cable or fiber), some homes still use ADSL/VDSL especially in rural areas. Replacing a DSL modem/router has some extra considerations.</p> <p>Unlike cable modems which follow DOCSIS standards, DSL technologies vary (ADSL2+, VDSL2, etc.) and are sometimes tied to the ISP’s network gear. You <em>may</em> be able to purchase your own DSL modem, but ensure it supports the same standard and Annex (A vs B, etc.) that your ISP uses. Some ISPs allow approved third-party DSL modems; others might only support their provided unit. Check your ISP’s help pages or user forums for models that have worked for others.</p> <p>Often, the ISP’s DSL modem is also a router/Wi-Fi combo. Like with cable modems, you can use bridge mode. Then you can connect your own router for all routing tasks.  If bridge mode isn’t available, using your router in DMZ or double NAT on DSL is possible but not ideal because it can create issues with gaming, streaming, VPN, etc.</p> <p>Many DSL ISPs use PPPoE (Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet) for authentication. If so, you’ll need your ISP-issued username and password. When you use your own equipment, you must enter these credentials into your router’s WAN settings (if bridging the ISP modem) or into the new DSL modem. This allows it to log into the ISP network. You can sometimes find these credentials by downloading the raw xml or json backup files.</p> <p>Lastly, simply swapping DSL modems may not work until the new modem is configured correctly (VPI/VCI numbers, modulation settings, etc., if applicable). Some providers lock the line to the modem’s MAC or serial. Overall, it’s possible to use your own router with DSL as well. The benefit, again, is better Wi-Fi, LAN speeds, and features than the typically outdated ISP unit. Weigh the pros and cons.</p> <h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Fiber_Internet_FTTH_with_ONT"></span>Fiber Internet (FTTH with ONT)<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3> <p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-20886" src="https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fiber_optic_cable_ends-868x579.png" alt="" width="868" height="579" srcset="https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fiber_optic_cable_ends-868x579.png 868w, https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fiber_optic_cable_ends-300x200.png 300w, https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fiber_optic_cable_ends-560x373.png 560w" sizes="auto"  fetchpriority="low"/></p> <p>Fiber-to-the-home (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_to_the_x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTTH</a>) is increasingly common. If your ISP ran an optical fiber to your residence, they likely provided an ONT (<a href="https://neosnetworks.com/resources/blog/optical-network-terminal-ont/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Optical Network Terminal</a>). An ONT is essentially the “modem” for fiber. It converts the fiber optic light signals into a standard Ethernet network connection.</p> <p>The ONT’s Ethernet hand-off (WAN) works with any standard router, so you don’t need a special “fiber router”, just one with a gigabit (or faster) WAN port. Set that WAN port for DHCP or, if required, PPPoE/VLAN tagging. Check your ISP’s documentation for the exact settings.</p> <h4><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Replacing_an_ISP_Fiber_Gateway"></span>Replacing an ISP Fiber Gateway<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h4> <p>Some ISPs ship a combined ONT + router. You have two practical options:</p> <ol> <li>Bridge or “ONT passthrough” mode (disables routing, leaving only ONT functions, so you can run your own router behind it).</li> <li>Swap for a standalone ONT (request a pure ONT if you don’t need the ISP’s Wi-Fi features).</li> </ol> <p>If neither option is offered, you can still attach your router and use DMZ or accept double-NAT, but bridging is cleaner.</p> <h4><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Deleting_the_ONT_altogether"></span>Deleting the ONT altogether<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h4> <p><em>Note: If your ISP bundles VoIP or IPTV, those may still rely on the original gateway or a dedicated ONT port. Confirm with the provider how to keep those services working when you supply your own router or optics.</em></p> <p>While most customers must keep the ISP-supplied ONT, a handful of providers allow you to terminate the fiber directly in your router’s SFP/SFP+ cage using a compatible GPON or XGS-PON optical module. In these scenarios the router handles PPPoE (or DHCP/VLAN) itself and the ONT can be removed entirely.</p> <p>This approach is niche; your router must support the exact PON standard, and you’ll need the ISP’s serial/LOID or authentication details.

It’s wise to keep the ISP device until you’re confident your new setup is stable. Once you’ve run successfully for a few weeks, you likely won’t need the old unit at all.</p> <h2><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Useful_Resources_and_Links"></span>Useful Resources and Links<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2> <p>Below is a curated index of reputable resources, compatibility lists, and support pages to help you choose, configure, and troubleshoot third-party modem and router hardware across cable, DSL, and fiber connections.</p> <h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Open-Source_Router_Firmware_Compatibility"></span>Open-Source Router Firmware &amp;

This can deliver an advanced level control and insight into your home network. It’s more hands-on but highly educational. For example, some users repurpose an old PC or a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Raspberry Pi</a> with dual network interfaces as a router, installing <a href="https://openwrt.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenWrt</a> or <a href="https://gridscale.io/en/community/tutorials/debian-router-gateway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Debian</a> to fine-tune everything. Just ensure the hardware can handle your internet speed (gigabit and multigig routing can be CPU-intensive without specialized hardware).</p> <p><strong>Aftermarket Firmware on Commercial Routers</strong></p> <p>Many off-the-shelf routers support replacing the factory firmware with open-source alternatives (like <a href="https://openwrt.org/toh/start" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenWrt</a>, <a href="https://dd-wrt.com/support/router-database/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DD-WRT</a>, <a href="https://wiki.freshtomato.org/doku.php/hardware_compatibility" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FreshTomato</a>, etc.). This can breathe new life into a device by adding features the manufacturer didn’t include. Check the router’s model compatibility on the firmware’s website before attempting this. Open-source firmware can allow things like running a VPN client for all traffic, advanced monitoring, or integrating with home automation.</p> <p><strong>Mesh Networking and Coverage</strong></p> <p>If your goal in replacing the ISP router is better wireless coverage, consider a mesh Wi-Fi system or a router + extenders. Mesh systems (e.g., <a href="https://ui.com/wifi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unifi WiFi</a>, <a href="https://store.google.com/gb/product/nest_wifi_pro" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Nest WiFi</a>, <a href="https://eero.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eero</a>, <a href="https://www.netgear.com/home/wifi/mesh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Netgear Orbi</a>, <a href="https://www.omadanetworks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TP-Link Omada</a>, etc.) can blanket a home in reliable Wi-Fi, and they can usually be used with any modem/ONT. You would still replace or bridge the ISP gateway, then connect the mesh base unit as your main router. This is beginner-friendly while still improving performance.</p> <p><strong>Bookmark and make use of </strong><a href="https://routersecurity.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>RouterSecurity.org</strong></a></p> <p>An in-depth, ad-free reference by <a href="https://www.michaelhorowitz.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael Horowitz</a> dedicated to securing home and business routers. Offers extensive checklists, configuration advice, explanations of risks, guides to picking secure routers, firmware tips, and step-by-step best practices to harden router settings for both beginners and technical users. I have utilized the extensive range of available tools and their corresponding resources. Also see <a href="https://defensivecomputingchecklist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Defensive Computing Checklist</a>.</p> <h2><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Conclusion"></span>Conclusion<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2> <p>Replacing your ISP’s modem/router can seem intimidating to newcomers, but it’s a one-time effort that often pays off in a better internet experience. We’ve seen that cable users can enjoy full control with their own modem and a high-performance router, fiber users can plug into or delete the ISP&#8217;s ONT by using a router of their choice, and even DSL folks can often tweak or swap equipment for improvements. The key is understanding your connection type and following a few setup steps diligently.</p> <p>By taking charge of your home network hardware, you gain the freedom to use open-source solutions, configure your network to your heart’s content, and ensure you’re not overpaying for subpar equipment. Many tech enthusiasts consider this a rite of passage. A move from being a passive consumer of whatever router the ISP hands you, to being the master of your own home network. And even if you’re not a tech guru, simply enjoying stronger Wi-Fi, better coverage, and the peace of mind of no rental fees makes it worthwhile.</p> <p>In summary, don’t be afraid to make the switch. With the tips in this guide and a bit of research into your specific ISP’s requirements, anyone can upgrade their network setup. Your favorite Linux and open-source-powered devices on your network will thank you for it!

Unlike wall-mounted racks, which typically force you to work in tight spaces or require unmounting for changes, a mobile rack can be simply rolled out for easy maintenance or upgrades.</p> <p>Casters (wheels) allow you to move your entire setup with ease. Whether you need to re-cable, clean behind the rack, or relocate hardware for a new project, mobility means you’re not locked into a single, less convenient location.</p> <p>When it’s time to add new hardware or reorganize cables, a rolling rack saves significant effort. Simply unlock the wheels and roll the rack out for full access. Having access from all sides also makes it easier to manage airflow. This is often important for home networks, as confined spaces can quickly lead to heat and dust buildup.</p> <p>A few downsides of a rolling network rack I can think of are reduced stability on uneven floors, increased risk of accidental movement, and limited weight capacity compared to fixed racks.</p> <h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Why_10%E2%80%B3_Racks_Are_Not_Included"></span>Why 10&#8243; Racks Are Not Included<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3> <p>This roundup focuses on rolling racks that can handle full-size, 19-inch network equipment from brands like UniFi, Cisco, Aruba, TP-Link, Trendnet and others. Many 10&#8243; racks are sized for small form-factor devices and often have limited options compared to hardware devices without a size restriction.</p> <p>For admins, tinkerers, and serious home network builders, hardware selection should be driven by your network’s requirements and long-term goals. not by what’s easiest to fit in a 10&#8243; rack. That’s why only full-size rack options are featured here.</p> <p>That said, if your goal is an ultra-compact build or you only need to mount a few small devices, a 10&#8243; rack may be the best choice for your specific space or setup.</p> <h2><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Choosing_a_Rolling_Network_Rack_What_Matters_Most"></span>Choosing a Rolling Network Rack: What Matters Most<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2> <p>When selecting a rolling network rack for your network setup, start by checking the weight rating of the frame <em>with</em> the casters. Most rolling racks are designed for small to mid-sized systems and aren’t intended to handle the heavy loads typical of enterprise hardware. Ensuring that your rack isn’t overloaded will help prevent damage and make it easy to move when needed. Generally, they are designed to support 200 to 500 lbs.</p> <p>It’s also important to choose a rack with high-quality, lockable casters. Locking the wheels once the rack is in position adds stability and safety, so your equipment stays secure whether you’re working on it or leaving it unattended.</p> <p>Next consider security features such as optional lockable or removable panels or doors if your network setup is located in a shared space or where access needs to be controlled. These features can offer extra peace of mind by protecting your sensitive equipment from accidental bumps while still allowing you the flexibility to move the rack as needed.</p> <p>Finally, racks designed for AV (audio-visual) equipment can also be a good fit for home and small office network setups, offering practical features and flexibility depending on your space and requirements.</p> <h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Why_AV_Racks_Are_Included"></span>Why AV Racks Are Included<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3> <p>You might notice that some of the recommended racks below are labeled as AV racks rather than traditional server or network racks. This is intentional. While AV racks are designed to organize audio, video, and home automation gear, most high-quality AV racks use the same 19-inch mounting width, standard rack unit (“U”) sizing, and mounting screw patterns found in traditional network/server racks.</p> <p>For home and small office builds, where gear weight and cooling tend to be modest, AV racks often offer excellent organization, build quality, and airflow.</p> <p>Of course, there are differences worth noting. AV racks may prioritize aesthetic features such as glass doors, fans, or cable management extras and some models use different rail threads for mounting compared to enterprise server racks. As such, checking rack depth, ventilation, mounting screw compatibility, and weight limit rating is important <em>before</em> choosing.</p> <p>As long as you verify fit and cooling, AV racks can safely and effectively support network switches, patch panels, routers, and some rackmount servers.</p> <p>They’re included in this roundup because they represent practical, proven solutions for real-world networks. Also, without the glass, fans, and extras, they can be had at very competitive prices.</p> <h2><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Recommended_Rolling_Network_Racks"></span>Recommended Rolling Network Racks<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2> <p>Below, you’ll find several well-reviewed rolling racks that offer a range of styles. From open frames for easy access and cooling to enclosed models for added security and privacy. Many of these network racks are available in 6U, 9U, 12U, and 20U+ sizes. Based on my experience, 12U offers an ideal balance for most home networks and small office setups, so that&#8217;s the size I’ve selected to feature here.</p> <p>Although this short list focuses on value and high-quality, each recommendation is suited to different spaces and priorities, so review the features of each to ensure the best fit for your environment.</p> <p><em><strong>NOTE:</strong> As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases.

But spurred by China’s rapid progress with models like DeepSeek, the <a href="https://www.ai.gov/action-plan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new US plan</a> calls open-source AI, especially “open-weight” models, a critical national asset.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>&#8230;will people like us, the hobbyists and small teams building cool stuff at home or in small offices, genuinely get better access to high-powered GPUs, affordable compute, and the open models that drive modern AI?</em></strong></p> <p style="text-align: left;">Policymakers now say that making models and code more available (Llama, DeepSeek, etc.) boosts innovation (more eyes and hands mean faster progress), sets global standards in America’s favor (“values-led AI”) and lets startups, academics, and even hobbyists build with the same tools as Big Tech.</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Read the full <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Americas-AI-Action-Plan.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">United States AI Action Plan here [PDF]</a>.</strong></p> <p>Here&#8217;s a key excerpt from the US Government&#8217;s AI Action Plan:<br /> <em>“Open-source and open-weight models could become global standards in some areas of business and in academic research worldwide. For that reason, they also have geostrategic value. While the decision of whether and how to release an open or closed model is fundamentally up to the developer, the Federal government should create a supportive environment for open models.”</em></p> <h2><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Why_This_Is_a_Big_Deal_for_Open_Source_Linux"></span>Why This Is a Big Deal for Open Source &amp; Linux<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2> <p>Well, validation. The US government is officially backing the open model, something the Linux <a href="https://linuxcommunity.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">communities</a> have championed for decades. This shift could mean more resources in the long run, but major benefits might remain limited to large organizations or research labs unless structural issues are addressed.</p> <p>If you’ve <a href="https://linuxblog.io/build-llm-linux-server-on-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">built a local LLM server</a>, experimented with <a class="break-word hover:text-super hover:decoration-super underline decoration-from-font underline-offset-1 transition-all duration-300" href="https://linuxblog.io/install-deepseek-linux/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">DeepSeek on Linux</a>, or contributed to FOSS (Free and open-source software), this is huge.</p> <p>A practical point in the plan is to expect new ways to access “enterprise” GPUs and cloud power, with lower prices for individuals and small organizations. The plan envisions a market for compute power that makes enterprise-grade resources more available. Whether that really happens is up in the air. Also, remember the “<a href="https://opensource.org/blog/metas-llama-license-is-still-not-open-source" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is Llama open?</a>” arguments? Now they’re happening in Congress. Openness may mean risk, but the argument is that open code (and Linux-style peer review) can also surface vulnerabilities and other risks faster.</p> <h2><span class="ez-toc-section" id="How_This_Connects_to_Your_Linux_World"></span>How This Connects to Your Linux World<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2> <p>Every step, from training a model to running AI locally or customizing an open LLM, leans heavily on the underlying system. Case in point, my <a class="break-word hover:text-super hover:decoration-super underline decoration-from-font underline-offset-1 transition-all duration-300" href="https://linuxblog.io/deepseek-local-self-host/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">DeepSeek Local</a> guide wouldn’t exist without open weights and open infrastructure. As such, <a href="https://linuxblog.io/build-llm-linux-server-on-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Building your own LLM server</a> becomes more viable only if big vendors and government actually follow through on making compute cheaper and access easier, which is far from guaranteed.</p> <p>Of course, big vendors like (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AWS</a>, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Cloud</a>, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft Azure</a>, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/solutions/ai/generative-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA</a>, and <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/solutions/ai.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMD</a>) have strong profit incentives not to make compute cheap by default. However, government action, a bigger user base, anticipatory regulation, and the need for leadership in open AI ecosystems mean they may strategically offer better access. Especially if it’s funded or mandated by public policy.</p> <p>If you’re frustrated with closed platforms, this policy could signal fewer barriers and more Linux-native tools down the line. Although not every model or release will match the freedoms found in classic FLOSS projects (FOSS stands for Free/Libre and open-source software, that is, software that’s truly free to use, audit, modify, and share).</p> <h2><span class="ez-toc-section" id="What_Should_We_Watch_For_Next"></span>What Should We Watch For Next?<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2> <p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-20781 size-large" title="Why Washington Suddenly Cares About Open Source AI—And What It Means for Linux Fans" src="https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Why_Washington_Suddenly_Cares_About_Open_Source_AI_What_It_Means_for_Linux_Fans-868x579.jpg" alt="Why Washington Suddenly Cares About Open Source AI—And What It Means for Linux Fans" width="868" height="579" srcset="https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Why_Washington_Suddenly_Cares_About_Open_Source_AI_What_It_Means_for_Linux_Fans-868x579.jpg 868w, https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Why_Washington_Suddenly_Cares_About_Open_Source_AI_What_It_Means_for_Linux_Fans-300x200.jpg 300w, https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Why_Washington_Suddenly_Cares_About_Open_Source_AI_What_It_Means_for_Linux_Fans-560x374.jpg 560w" sizes="auto"  loading="lazy" fetchpriority="low"/></p> <p><strong>Update (July 27, 2025):<br /> </strong><em>Just as I was finishing this article, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-proposes-new-global-ai-cooperation-organisation-2025-07-26/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">news broke</a> that China has proposed a global AI cooperation body, positioning itself as an alternative to the US-led approach. Chinese Premier Li Qiang announced the initiative at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai, making it clear that AI policy is now a global competition, not just a US concern. This adds even more urgency to questions about open access, standards, and how both major powers want to shape the future of AI. </em></p> <p>When a new policy like the US AI Action Plan drops, it’s easy to get caught up in the headlines and talk about future possibilities. But what really counts is follow-through. Funding and real-world access matter more than any official document. Ambitious roadmaps won’t help home labbers or FOSS teams unless actual resources, hardware, and open models start landing in the hands of the community.</p> <p>What I’m watching for is simple: <strong>will people like us, the hobbyists and small teams building cool stuff at home or in small offices, genuinely get better access to high-powered GPUs, affordable compute, and the open models that drive modern AI? Or will it still feel like these tools are reserved for big tech and universities?</strong></p> <p>There’s also the classic debate about openness and security. People have argued for years: does sharing code and models make things safer through transparency, or just open new doors for attackers? Now, this same argument is being played out at the highest levels of government. The big difference is that, for once, the open-source folks from testing, research, and support teams have a seat at the table. What happens next could set the bar for how software gets built and trusted everywhere.</p> <p>Another thing that stands out is the door this opens for real leadership from the open-source world. The AI Action Plan isn’t just for coders. It’s a call for everyone in FOSS (advocates, project maintainers, and power users) to help decide how AI should be built and used safely.</p> <p>The increased attention from government and big organizations is a double-edged sword. There’s more scrutiny which could also lead to stricter <a href="https://linuxblog.io/ai-regulation-ai-to-regulate-itself/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">regulations</a> and more government control over the direction of AI development. However, it also opens up opportunities for more grants, more real-world testing, and faster improvements as bugs get found and squashed. Funding could actually give small projects the resources they need for developing open AI &#8211; no pun intended.</p> <h2><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Where_This_Policy_Might_Stumble"></span>Where This Policy Might Stumble<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2> <p>I’m excited about what new US support for open-source AI could mean for our community, but let’s be real about the caveats. There are <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-white-house-ai-action-plan-a-new-chapter-in-u-s-ai-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">real doubts</a> about whether these promises, like cheaper hardware, better funding, and open model releases will turn into concrete results. The plan isn’t super clear on where the money comes from, which agencies are in charge, or when any of this actually lands in your hands.</p> <p>There’s also some <a href="https://hai.stanford.edu/news/inside-trumps-ambitious-ai-action-plan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">controversy built in</a>. For example, the focus on removing terms like “diversity” and “climate change” from risk guidelines has critics warning this could chill academic freedom and twist the “open” spirit into something more controlled. Add in new export controls that tighten access to hardware, and you’ve got a weird tension: pushing openness but also making it harder for some to play.</p> <p>Even as I cheer for more open source, the risks are real. Open models can be misused, especially as they get more capable. The debate on balancing openness, freedom, and security is far from settled.</p> <p>Before wrapping up, there’s hope here, but also tough questions and possible roadblocks. If you think I missed something, hit the comments and share your view.</p> <h2><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Conclusion"></span>Conclusion<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2> <p>The only way we know if these new policies actually work is if everyday users, open-source projects, and the wider community all benefit. If people get more freedom, access to better hardware, and stronger open-platforms, we’ll know it’s more than just talk. Openness and accountability should guide everything that comes next, because that’s what keeps the ecosystem healthy.</p> <p>Not all new AI models released under this policy will be fully open source or FLOSS. Many are “open-weight” but carry licenses or restrictions that set them apart from classic Linux or FOSS projects. Always check the actual model license if you care about full software freedom.</p> <p>As always, I’ll be watching this space and reporting back. Maybe you’re just running DeepSeek for your notes, or maybe you’re hacking on a new LLM stack in your home lab. Either way, the next year or two could put more open-source and Linux, in particular, at the center of something much bigger than our weekend experiments.</p> <p>While it&#8217;s uncertain whether the US will truly deliver on its promises, the coming years will tell whether these ambitions translate into real, accessible tools for the Linux and open-source community.</p> <p>Please take a look at my other related articles:</p> <ul style="content-visibility: auto;contain-intrinsic-size: auto 90.5625px;"> <li><strong><a class="break-word hover:text-super hover:decoration-super underline decoration-from-font underline-offset-1 transition-all duration-300" href="https://linuxblog.io/deepseek-local-self-host/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">How to Self-Host DeepSeek</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a title="Install DeepSeek on Linux in 3 Minutes" href="https://linuxblog.io/install-deepseek-linux/" rel="bookmark">Install DeepSeek on Linux in 3 Minutes</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a class="break-word hover:text-super hover:decoration-super underline decoration-from-font underline-offset-1 transition-all duration-300" href="https://linuxblog.io/build-llm-linux-server-on-budget/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">LLM Linux Server on a Budget</a></strong></li> <li><a title="Install AI Models on Linux: Discover LLMs and Chatbots for Linux" href="https://linuxblog.io/install-ai-models-on-linux-discover-llms-and-chatbots-for-linux/" rel="bookmark"><strong>Install AI Models on Linux: Discover LLMs and Chatbots for Linux</strong></a></li> </ul><div  class="hayden-ace6f899b3fb3892870e7f43bcdb7f2d hayden-end-of-article" id="hayden-ace6f899b3fb3892870e7f43bcdb7f2d"></div> <h3 class="tag-line" style="padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 8px;">Tags: <a href="https://linuxblog.io/tag/ai/" rel="tag">AI</a>, <a href="https://linuxblog.io/tag/homelab/" rel="tag">homelab</a></h3> <div class="custom-post-footer" style="content-visibility: auto;contain-intrinsic-size: auto 93.28125px;margin-top: 0px; padding-top: 8px; padding-bottom: 1px; padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px; background-color: #dae8fc;"> <p class="share-message"><i>Thanks for reading!

Let it handle the grunt work so you can spend more time doing what humans are actually good at: solving real problems, thinking critically, and being creative.</p> <p><strong>Use AI to:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Draft responses or summarize reports in seconds</li> <li>Schedule meetings and auto-respond to common emails</li> <li>Analyze customer data so you can focus on the insights, not the spreadsheets</li> </ul> <p>That’s not cutting corners; it’s maximizing your potential.

What makes a terminal the “best” ultimately depends on what you need. For example, <a href="https://www.warp.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warp</a> uses modern Rust and AI to push the boundaries of what a terminal can do.</p> <p>GPU acceleration has improved the performance of emulators like <a href="https://alacritty.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alacritty</a> and <a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Kitty</a> which have smoother scrolling, faster rendering and better support for high-resolution displays.</p> <p>For those focused on workflow and multitasking, multiplexers like <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tmux</a> and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/manual/screen.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">screen</a> (whether integrated into the terminal or used alongside one) offer advanced session management to make it easier to juggle multiple tasks in one window.</p> <p>Customization plays a considerable role in user experience. Some of us like a modern sleek approach like <a href="https://www.waveterm.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wave</a> and <a href="https://tabby.sh/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Tabby</a>, while others like terminals like <a href="https://hyper.is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hyper</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Swordfish90/cool-retro-term" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cool Retro Term</a> which have theme and plugin support appealing to both functionality and nostalgia.</p> <p>In the end, the best terminal emulator is the one that fits your workflow, priorities and personal style.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Conclusion"></span>Conclusion<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2> <p>It&#8217;s clear that each emulator, with its distinct set of features and design philosophies, caters to a specific segment of users. For those seeking the raw power and simplicity of <a href="https://st.suckless.org/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">St (Simple Terminal)</a> or <a href="https://invisible-island.net/xterm/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">XTerm</a> to those requiring the advanced features and customization of <a href="https://terminator-gtk3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Terminator</a> or <a href="https://gnunn1.github.io/tilix-web/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Tilix</a>. This diversity not only reflects the dynamic nature of software development and user interaction but also underscores the terminal&#8217;s enduring relevance in the age of very graphical interfaces.</p> <p>In navigating these tools, one thing remains constant, terminal emulators continue to be essential—if not sacred—tools in a Linux power user&#8217;s arsenal.</p> <p><strong>Related reading:</strong></p> <ul> <li><a title="90 Linux Commands frequently used by Linux Sysadmins (updated to 100+)" href="https://linuxblog.io/90-linux-commands-frequently-used-by-linux-sysadmins/" rel="bookmark">90 Linux Commands frequently used by Linux Sysadmins (updated to 100+)</a>.</li> <li><a title="60 Linux Networking commands and scripts" href="https://linuxblog.io/linux-networking-commands-scripts/" rel="bookmark">60 Linux Networking commands and scripts</a>.</li> <li><a title="htop and top Alternatives: Glances, nmon" href="https://linuxblog.io/alternatives-top-htop/" rel="bookmark">htop and top Alternatives: Glances, nmon</a>.</li> <li><a title="SSH command in Linux, with examples" href="https://linuxblog.io/ssh-command-in-linux/" rel="bookmark">SSH command in Linux, with examples</a>.</li> </ul><div  class="hayden-ef9426bf07a6308cc58fae396c0a160d hayden-end-of-article" id="hayden-ef9426bf07a6308cc58fae396c0a160d"></div> <h3 class="tag-line" style="padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 8px;">Tags: <a href="https://linuxblog.io/tag/commands/" rel="tag">commands</a>, <a href="https://linuxblog.io/tag/desktop/" rel="tag">desktop</a>, <a href="https://linuxblog.io/tag/server/" rel="tag">server</a>, <a href="https://linuxblog.io/tag/ssh/" rel="tag">ssh</a>, <a href="https://linuxblog.io/tag/sysadmins/" rel="tag">sysadmins</a></h3> <div class="custom-post-footer" style="content-visibility: auto;contain-intrinsic-size: auto 93.28125px;margin-top: 0px; padding-top: 8px; padding-bottom: 1px; padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px; background-color: #dae8fc;"> <p class="share-message"><i>Thanks for reading!
