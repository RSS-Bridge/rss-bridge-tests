However, analysts at Roth Capital argue the news isn’t a setback for ASTS - in fact, they say it highlights the market opportunity.</p> <p>Roth reaffirmed its “Buy” rating on ASTS and set a 12-month price target of $56 a share, implying roughly 40% upside from current levels.</p> <p>Starlink’s reported $17 billion acquisition of 5G spectrum from EchoStar “continues to validate the ASTS strategy and market opportunity,” Roth analysts wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/spacanpanman/status/1965071146900140398/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">note</a>.</p> <!-- /investorsobserver_com_article_responsive_1 -->  <p>They added: “The timeline to market should trail ASTS, given the lead times on satellite and smartphone upgrades.

Gold prices have surged between 35% and 40% in 2025, while the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index has soared nearly 90% year to date. Both have far outpaced the S&P 500’s roughly 12% gain.</p> <p>Gold’s rally has been fueled in part by waning confidence in the U.S. dollar and expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in an inflationary environment.
