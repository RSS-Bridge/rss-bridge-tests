                <div class="chp_raw" id="chp_raw"><p class="p6"><i>London, June 1813</i><i></i></p> <hr /> <p class="p6">“Miss Wright, welcome to Catherwood House,” intoned the butler at the door.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He looked past her to the hackney cab waiting at the end of the townhouse’s steps.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Jut beyond it flowed the noisy bustle of Mayfair street traffic.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Shall I send a boy out for your luggage?”</p> <p class="p6">“Please,” she nodded and stepped inside out of the sweltering London air.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“There’s just a single trunk, I shan’t stay long.”</p> <p class="p6">“Because you have to get back to your gainful employment as the governess of your own heirs,” came the arch but still bemused voice of the Countess Catherwood.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The lady strode down the stairs into the hall, as immaculately dressed as she ever was, today in buttery yellow silk.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Your recklessness is seconded only by your audacity, girl.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You should see the letters Enid sends me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She cannot make heads or tails of you.”</p> <p class="p6">Amelia crossed the room to embrace the woman.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“She was very put out when I told her I was leaving for a week.”</p> <p class="p6">“It’s not exactly in keeping with your purported profession,” she observed with an elevated eyebrow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The arch look might have looked judgemental if she did not then cackle immediately thereafter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She turned and led Amelia deeper into the townhouse; a footman was setting out tea service in the parlour.</p> <p class="p6">“I did explain that my contract affords me generous leave, and that I am fetching teaching materials for the boys, but that wasn’t enough,” said Amelia, lips twitching. “She only relented when I told her I was staying with you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You’ll safeguard my reputation, won’t you, CeeCee?”</p> <p class="p6">“Safeguard her reputation, more like,” the lady chuckled, rolling her eyes, and sat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Tea or punch, my dear?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And how are you for your equine constitutional?”</p> <p class="p6">Amelia settled into a couch that was leagues more comfortable than either the coach she’d spent the last two days in or the cab that had brought her the last leg of her journey.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her body seemed to root itself into the cushions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I did hold off this afternoon in the hopes that you’d have ice,” she admitted with a sigh.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“But punch as well, please.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am parched.”</p> <p class="p6">“Of course,” the lady answered, waving a footman out the side door and then bending over to pour, herself. The decanter dripped condensation as it spilled out its pink contents into two snifters.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You do realize I must grill you for all the details that Enid left out of her letters, either through propriety or ignorance.”</p> <p class="p6">Amelia accepted her glass gratefully.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Am I to earn my keep with gossip?”</p> <p class="p6">“That’s how society works, my dear,” CeeCee laughed, lifting her own glass.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You do know Enid is quite aware of how you and Miss Chesterley made use of your adjoining rooms.”</p> <p class="p6">Amelia nearly spat out her punch, both at the lady’s revelation as well as the surprisingly potent tang of alcohol in her drink.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Is she?”</p> <p class="p6">“Not her first lesbian houseguests,” the lady shrugged, swilling her boozy punch as if it were just fruit juice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Although I think she’s more accustomed to bored married women with terrible husbands.”</p> <p class="p6">“I do admit to some curiousity on her opinion of Theresa,” Amelia admitted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“She has a… signature character the likes of which I can’t imagine Mother approving.”</p> <p class="p6">But CeeCee waved a hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Bluestockings are old hat for your elders, Amelia.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Enid was, though, amusingly voluable about Miss Chesterley’s sartorial choices.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not so much in the ‘how dare she’ vein but more in the sense of ‘she’s too round for breeches.’”</p> <p class="p6">Despite her disappointment at her mother’s pettier judgment, Amelia wasn’t terribly surprised, either.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And your opinion?”</p> <p class="p6">“Chesterley is delightfully round,” the lady answered readily, “in ways your mother is not constitutionally equipped to appreciate.”</p> <p class="p6">Amelia couldn’t help but laugh.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I did actually mean your broader opinion on her character.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She steeled herself; CeeCee would not hold back.</p> <p class="p6">“Theresa Chesterley has always struck me as a dour woman,” Catherwood opined readily, “so full of purpose she is almost a boor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am surprised at your pairing, but that’s not to say it doesn’t work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You might be good for her yet.”</p> <p class="p6">If Theresa Chesterley ever consented to see Amelia again, that is; not that CeeCee seemed to know about the woman’s abrupt departure.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But Amelia was still curious:“And she for me?”</p> <p class="p6">“That remains to be seen,” she replied, voice dry and lips twisted in amusement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Although I can see the obvious appeal.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She refilled both their glasses and pointed accusingly at Amelia.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“But the flow of gossip thus far is the reverse of what it should be.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You need to tell me what you’ve done to anger Iris Sommerset.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She then tipped her head to the side.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Not that she needs much to set her off.”</p> <p class="p6">Amelia rolled her eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“She thinks I’m blackmailing her, which I am not.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But her fantasy of being blackmailed bears little difference from actually being blackmailed, at least in terms of her fears and resentment.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She winced slightly; she hadn’t meant to divulge all that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She blamed the punch for loosening her tongue, and concluded that she might as well explain the situation, at least in selective detail.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I had already told her that I would keep a secret of hers, because it was harmless.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When I encouraged her to keep another secret—of a third party—she concluded that my silence was conditioned on hers.”</p> <p class="p6">“Her secret being that she’s sleeping with the new coachman?” CeeCee asked, eyebrow lifted.</p> <p class="p6">Despite her best efforts, a tiny surprised sound escaped Amelia’s lips.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Luckily that very moment, a footman arrived with a tall amber glass on a tray, and she used the interruption of his laying it out for her and then thanking him for doing so to regain her equilibrium.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I didn’t think Mother knew.”</p> <p class="p6">“She doesn’t,” CeeCee shrugged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“As far as I know, at least.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But Enid tends to tell me everything she uncovers.”</p> <p class="p6">Amelia took a deep breath and started knocking back her virus amantis equae in not-particularly-ladylike gulps.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>CeeCee would understand.</p> <p class="p6">“I rather like her, actually,” the lady confessed while Amelia alternated between breaths and downing the remaining contents of her glass.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Iris, that is.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Crossed paths with her a few times, mostly at your father’s Glorious Twelfth events.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sad, in retrospect, that you always had to go hunting and could not have stayed back to gossip with the rest of the girls, my dear.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She shot Amelia an apologetic look that she barely caught between gulps.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The lady continued. “She was a terrible match for Eustance, of course.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The late Eustace, I suppose we should call him, now.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Eustace the Elder.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Whichever.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He needed someone to ground him, manage a tight household budget while the Duke kept him on a short leash, not let him go gallivanting off on that ridiculous canal scheme.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But that was not Iris.”</p> <p class="p6">“I am finding it hard to appreciate her appeal when she<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>insists on staring daggers at me whenever Mother isn’t looking,” Amelia sighed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She set aside her empty glass and took up her punch to banish the aftertaste lingering in her mouth.</p> <p class="p6">“She has an artistic soul,” Catherwood sighed, half-heartedly defending the lady.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Insightful, creative, passionate, devilish sense of humour… none of which helped her in the life she chose.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I wish I could have seen what she’d have become without marrying your brother.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or—forgive the morbid thought, my dear—if your father’s passing and your brother’s subsequent inheritance had come earlier.”</p> <p class="p6">“As a housemate, she is snappish and hostile, and as a mother, she is… inconsistent,” the girl groused, pushing herself back into her seat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“She lies to the boys.”</p> <p class="p6">CeeCee clucked her tongue, not at absent Iris, but at Amelia.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“All mothers lie to their children on occasion.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sometimes it’s necessary for the children’s well-being.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sometimes it’s necessary for the mother’s sanity.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She put up a hand before Amelia could reply.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m sure she’s made missteps.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But the path she’s had to take has not been easy, either.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Your job as governess is a sprint; hers as a mother is a marathon.”</p> <p class="p6">Amelia dug herself into the cushions a little more.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Point taken.”</p> <p class="p6">“You are fetching teaching materials for the boys,” her host changed the subject, “and no doubt meeting Miss Chesterley as the real purpose of your London visit.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Anything else?”</p> <p class="p6">“I will call on Miss Chesterley, but she is not the focus of my visit,” Amelia protested weakly, even though she was grateful for the conversational shift.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I am also visiting Miss Marianne Woods at the grammar school where she is teaching now.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I hope her advice will steer me towards better finds in the bookstores for the boys.”</p> <p class="p6">CeeCee studied her for a moment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Amelia steeled herself for the countess to tell her she wasn’t very subtle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But instead she said: “Miss Chesterley is not expecting you?”</p> <p class="p6">“My first errand is to the printer’s, to pick up my new calling cards,” Amelia explained, and could feel her cheeks flushing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She was a little embarrassed at how excited she was to see her new calling cards, with her proper name on them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’ll use them at Theresa’s if she’s not in residence.”</p> <p class="p6">“I don’t think she keeps any help,” the countess warned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You might be pushing your calling card through the mail slot rather than handing it off to a dutiful servant.”</p> <p class="p6">“I’m not entirely unworldly, CeeCee,” the girl laughed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I have called on people outside high society before.”</p> <hr /> <p class="p6">Theresa Chesterley’s address was more than a little outside of high society.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Shadwell address was close enough to Mayfair and Piccadilly, Amelia surmised, to allow Theresa access to her society connections, while also sitting far enough away (and close enough to the docks) to make rent affordable on the woman’s modest stipend.</p> <p class="p6">Amelia watched from the window of the rickety hackney she’d hired as the streets narrowed, the buildings grew thin, the doors and porches shrank.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She began to worry that the progression—or degression—of the neighbourhoods would continue until she found herself in some dark, squalid slum she dared not step foot in.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So she breathed a sigh of relief when the cab lurched to a halt outside a narrow building on a relatively clean street.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Respectable—if only just.</p> <p class="p6">The hackney driver agreed to wait a few minutes while she walked up the three steps to the door and, finding no bell, knocked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Only silence greeted her.</p> <p class="p6">With a short sigh of disappointment, Amelia withdrew her reticule and from it the little case of freshly-printed calling cards.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She’d already annotated the top three with CeeCee’s address for while she was in town.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This she slid through the mail slot.</p> <p class="p6">The moment the card dropped from her fingers, however, the tromp of approaching footsteps sounded through the door.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Amelia stepped back just in time for the portal to be wrenched open.</p> <p class="p6">The woman who had opened it was not Theresa Chesterley.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She was lean, blonde, and young, wearing little more than a shift and a knitted housecoat which looked to have been tossed on top.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She folded her arms underneath her breasts and scowled softly at Amelia.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Wot?”</p> <p class="p6">“My apologies for intruding,” she answered reflexively.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I was looking for the home of Theresa Chesterley?”</p> <p class="p6">“You found it,” the woman replied, leaning on the doorjamb.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“She’s not in right now.”</p> <p class="p6">“A pity.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Do you know when she might return?” Amelia asked hopefully.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Does she take visitors at certain hours?”</p> <p class="p6">The woman twisted her lips together in amusement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“We don’t often entertain here.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Theresa goes out to visit.”</p> <p class="p6">“I see.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She gestured down at the woman’s bare feet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Just before you opened the door, I slipped my card through the slot.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Can you see that she gets it?”</p> <p class="p6">“Sure,” the woman answered without even looking down to spot where the card had fallen.</p> <p class="p6">Amelia nodded, as if nodding would bring the exchange back into alignment with her expectations and things would start making sense again.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It didn’t work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Good day.”</p> <p class="p6">The woman nodded curtly and shut the door.</p> <p class="p6">At least the hackney driver had waited.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Amelia boarded again and gave him her next address.</p> <hr /> <p class="p6">“If it’s all the same to you, miss,” drawled the driver as he opened the carriage door for her a half hour later, “I’ll walk you to this door.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He scowled suspiciously up and down the street, which was as dark and dirty as Amelia had feared Theresa’s neighborhood might be.</p> <p class="p6">The door to the school was not even ten feet from the hackney, but the driver walked protectively behind her the whole distance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She rapped on the door and fished out her fare, plus a generous tip.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Thank you, sir.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Your gallantry is appreciated.”</p> <p class="p6">The man scoffed good-naturedly at her language and doffed his cap as he accepted the coins.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When the door behind Amelia opened, he took one step back but no more, waiting to make sure it was opened by someone she recognized or trusted.</p> <p class="p6">It was Marianne Woods, looking a little worn around the edges, but still capable of summoning up a bright smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Miss Wright.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So good to see you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Won’t you come in?”</p> <p class="p6">With a final grateful nod to the cabbie, she did so.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m not interrupting?” she asked the woman leading her deeper into the building.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The poorly-lit foyer gave way to a dingy hall, but the next room was wide and bright, full of long tables with benches along one side.</p> <p class="p6">“No, the morning class is gone and the evening class won’t be here until six.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Marianne kicked a bench out from its table and sat down with a huff, leaving enough room for Amelia at the end.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Start showing at six, that is.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They don’t exactly come from households with clocks on the mantels.”</p> <p class="p6">“A markedly different clientele than your last school.”</p> <p class="p6">“Quite,” Marianne nodded, and then looked around the room with a tender look.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Sometimes it seems strange to be teaching girls to read English rather than French.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But they are good girls, mostly, and eager to learn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When they’re allowed.”</p> <p class="p6">Amelia lifted an eyebrow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Who’s stopping them?”</p> <p class="p6">“Parents, grandparents, the odd uncle, their employers, since most of them have some sort of job,” the teacher sighed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“If anyone needs anything—tend to your sick aunt, do this laundry that didn’t get done yesterday, watch the baby while Mother tries to find work—it falls on the young women of the household.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I never know who’ll be attending any given class.”</p> <p class="p6">“How many do you typically have at once?”</p> <p class="p6">The teacher shrugged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Anywhere from ten to thirty.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When we’re full to bursting, it’s quite the cacophony in here.”</p> <p class="p6">“I can only imagine,” she answered, and her mind’s eye filled the room with charmingly dirty little girls shouting excitedly, ready to learn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For a moment, she placed herself into the scene, and thought about coming here, or someplace like it, once Gregory was off to school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Perhaps she could do some good, here.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I hope it is more challenging than overwhelming.”</p> <p class="p6">“Depends on the day” Marianne laughed, and then scoffed, “Day before last—”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But then a cloud passed over her features.</p> <p class="p6">“What is it?”</p> <p class="p6">“Not all the stories are pretty or funny,” she warned. Amelia nodded encouragingly, and the teacher steeled her nerves to continue.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When she did, her voice came soft and quiet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Day before last, one of the girls asked what ‘rape’ was.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She shook her head, as if she couldn’t believe her own story.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And of course I told her, and the rest of the class, because… well, I don’t believe that such things should be kept from them, and honestly it’s not like there’s anyone who will get me in trouble for speaking of taboo subjects.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But still.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not what I was expecting when we opened our grammar books.”</p> <p class="p6">Amelia reached forward to squeeze the lady’s knee.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And here I thought my two were a handful.”</p> <p class="p6">“I’m sure they are,” Marianne commiserated, shaking her head to clear it of her own complaints.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Educating children raised in luxury has its own challenges.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These girls are no strangers to hard work, and they know that learning is worth the effort.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By contrast, I’ve had high-class students who had never exerted themselves at all.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Who frankly didn’t even know how.”</p> <p class="p6">Amelia thought of Eustace on his worst days, when it seemed no inducement could rouse him to putting in an honest effort, and nodded softly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And the solution, then?”</p> <p class="p6">Marianne smiled wanly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Find the prize that they care about, which is, I’m afraid, idiosyncratic to every child.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For some, it’s time alone; for others, it’s access to books or art supplies.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her face crumpled a little as she added, “And for some it’s a kind word and a smile, which I’ve always found simultaneously validating for my own prowess and heartbreaking when I consider what their home lives must lack.”</p> <p class="p6">Amelia nodded.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“My boys have had a hard time of it with their parents, and with their grandmother, for that matter.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She shook her head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“The pressures of rank and society can inflict brutal demands, and there’s little left over for the children.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You would think that adults would put the children first, but…”</p> <p class="p6">“Not when the adults are essentially children, themselves,” Marianne sighed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“We’ve had our share of those.”</p> <p class="p6">“At the seminary?”</p> <p class="p6">Marianne scoffed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Yes, but also here.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Possibly more so, here.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She gestured around the room, as if to indicate the whole school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“All of this depends on the charitable donations of…” There she faltered, smirked, and finished with “generous ladies of strong moral convictions.”</p> <p class="p6">Amelia snorted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“What were you about to call them?”</p> <p class="p6">Marianne looked left and right as if to check that they would not be overheard.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“In private, we call them the charity mavens,” she giggled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“They swoop in to visit with no notice, and they always have opinions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sometimes they also come with bank notes, which is appreciated, but they always come with opinions.”</p> <p class="p6">When Amelia raised her eyebrow, Marianne elaborated: “Last week, a worthy lady of considerable means informed me that the girls would learn better if they were better dressed, and suggested we devote some of our class time to learning to mend and sew.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She snorted delicately.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Half the girls do piecework or weave ribbon for pay; they’re no strangers to needle and thread.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Chances are good that some part of the lady’s own wardrobe was made by some of my girls.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But she saw a few tatters and concluded the problem was ignorance, not poverty.”</p> <p class="p6">“Did you dissuade her?” Amelia wanted to know.</p> <p class="p6">“I estimated the cost of fabric and thread to clothe the whole class… and may have pretended to believe she was offering to supply it,” Marianne laughed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“She dropped the subject soon thereafter.”</p> <p class="p6">“Money is no object until it is,” Amelia observed drily.</p> <p class="p6">Marianne sniffed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Money is how we encode what matters to us, as has recently been made clear to me.”</p> <p class="p6">Amelia winced.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m sorry, sore subject?”</p> <p class="p6">“It is, and it will be for some time, so I might as well build up a tolerance for it,” the teacher sighed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Jane and I thought we had solved all our problems when we won the suit, but it’s like the verdict tied the money to Lady Cumming Gordon admitting she was wrong.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If she never pays the money, she never has to admit wrongdoing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So therefore she’ll use every ounce of leverage and connection she has to forestall both payment and admission of guilt.”</p> <p class="p6">“How is Jane?” she asked, hoping it might be a change of subject.</p> <p class="p6">It was not.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Living on a pittance with her aunt in Edinburgh, and not doing at all well.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She gestured helplessly to what might have been north.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“We write.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She’s despondent.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She worries that she is being punished by the Almighty.”</p> <p class="p6">“It must be difficult being so far apart,” Amelia sighed, forcing herself not to think of her own, far more petty, separation.</p> <p class="p6">Marianne nodded, tears beading in the corners of her eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“We said it was temporary, but I… sometimes I worry that… that I’ll never see her again.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And then the floodgates opened and the woman broke down into sobs.</p> <p class="p6">Amelia rushed forward to wrap arms around Marianne, who collapsed into her embrace.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They sat there on the school bench, Amelia making soft placating noises and Marianne alternating between sobs and sniffles, for some time.</p> <p class="p6">Eventually the latter woman roused herself, reminded that Amelia had come for guidance on teaching materials, and the conversation shifted to more pragmatic concerns.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But as Amelia bid her farewell, she found herself more grateful that she had been there to comfort Marianne than for book recommendations, no matter how useful they’d be.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She gave the woman a fond smile, and resolved herself to find some way to better the situation of the two estranged and struggling lovers.</p> <hr /> <p class="p6">It was later than Amelia expected when she stepped outside, and darker, too.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Only a narrow strip of sky was visible between the soot-stained building fronts, and along it roiled a mottle of dark clouds limned by the sun.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Little light made it down to the street where Amelia had to hail a cab.</p> <p class="p6">The school had once been a factory, and the road it was on had once been a thoroughfare, but time had strangled the business out of the first and traffic out of the latter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A few delivery wagons and the stray rider came clattering down the cobbles, but there were no hackneys to hail among them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With a sigh, Amelia adjusted her skirts and resolved to walk to the high street, which she was relatively sure was a few blocks up the road in this direction, and try her luck there.</p> <p class="p6">She didn’t get far.</p> <p class="p6">A man came teetering down the road toward her, one hand outstretched to trail along the wall beside him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By his drunken stagger, he needed the wall for support as much as guidance.</p> <p class="p6">Amelia stalled her steps at the sight of his approach, and an involuntary “oh” escaped her lips.</p> <p class="p6">The drunk raised his eyes at the sound, took in Amelia and her bright frock, and then looked past her to the door of the school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then his gaze settled back on her as a leer smeared across his lips.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You’re that teacher-lady.”</p> <p class="p6">Amelia took a step back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Could she make a mad dash for the door?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I think you mean Miss Marianne Woods,” she said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m not—”</p> <p class="p6">But the man leveled a crooked, dirty finger at her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You’re the teacher-lady who fed lies to my daughter,” he insisted.</p> <p class="p6">“No, I—” Amelia stammered, and tried to flee.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But no sooner had she turned, than the man was on her, shoving her back against the wall, his face inches from hers.</p> <p class="p6">His breath washed rancid over Amelia as he shouted at her: “My daughter’s no better’n me, even with her letters!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But you tell her lies, you tell her that her pa’s a criminal, you turn her ‘gainst me.”</p> <p class="p6">Amelia kicked, the thin heel of her boot scraping up his shin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His balanced faltered and she twisted to the left, out of his grip, scrambling along the wall.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She ran, stumblingly, half-ducking half-falling into an alleyway, pumping her legs to put as much distance as she could between herself and the drunk.</p> <p class="p6">He howled in frustration more than pain, then charged down the alley after her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When his panting turned to laughter, she knew he was gaining on her, and then she was shoved against the dripping wall.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She tried to twist around and run, but it was no use.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His balled his hands into the front of her jacket, pinning her in place.</p> <p class="p6">“A man has a right to his wife’s body,” he wheezed at her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“But I reckon you dun know how any of that works, do you?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Prissy old maid, never felt the touch of a man.”</p> <p class="p6">This time when she made to move, he shoved his elbow up, knocking her head back against the bricks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She saw stars, and then his forearm was jammed up against her throat.</p> <p class="p6">With his other hand, he produced a knife.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Maybe I’ll give you a little prick, enh?” he sneered, running the tip down her side.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Teach you a lesson, teacher-lady.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’d enjoy that!”</p> <p class="p6">This is where I die, Amelia concluded, heart hammering.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She couldn’t move, and nothing she could say would placate the drunk.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Either he simply stabbed her to death in the alley, or he tried to rape her and in that assault discovered details about her that would incite him to stab her to death, anyway.</p> <p class="p6">But then a shout sounded from the mouth of the alley, and the man’s balance shifted as he turned towards the noise.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Amelia shoved him back again, turned to flee—</p> <p class="p6">—and his grip bashed her back into the bricks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A lance of pain skewered into her upper thigh, trailed up to her hip.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her leg went out from under her, and she fell.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The man made no move to catch her, flinging himself away and dashing further down the alleyway.</p> <p class="p6">Other footfalls came rushing in from the street.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Amelia’s vision swam; her fingers slapped uselessly against the bricks and cobbles, trying and failing to steady herself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The insides of her thighs were wet, hot, and sticky.</p> <p class="p6">Gentle hands guided her down to lie flat on the ground.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The strength of her body, the scene around her, the whole world seemed to be spiralling away from her, and in seeped a soft, quiet blackness, replacing all of everything.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The last words she heard were: “Don’t worry, miss.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m a doctor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m afraid I’ll have to lift your skirts to examine the wound…”</p> <div class="wi_authornotes"> <div> <div class="p-avatar-wrap"><a class="avatar has-link"

                <!-- Intentionally not escaping for html context -->
                <div class="chp_raw" id="chp_raw"><p class="p6"><i>Sussex, June 1813</i><i></i></p> <hr /> <p class="p6">The evening following Theresa Chesterley’s sudden departure, Amelia dashed off a letter which struck the balance, she felt, between fond affection and her growing panic at her lover’s disappearance.</p> <p class="p6">Had country life disagreed with Theresa’s sensibilities?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Had Mother taken Theresa aside and said something pointed and cutting?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or had Amelia herself been impetuous and presumptive in sharing her fantasy of domestic lesbian bliss, and then without any warning all but shoved Theresa directly into it?</p> <p class="p6">There was no real mystery as to what had spooked the woman.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Amelia hadn’t even asked Theresa’s thoughts on marriage in general before dumping her impossible dreams on her.</p> <p class="p6">She put none of that in the letter, no reiteration of her matrimonial fantasies and no acknowledgement that those dreams might have been too much.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Instead she communicated her hope that Theresa’s trip home had been at least uneventful if not necessarily pleasant, thanked her for the visit, and mentioned—briefly but pointedly—her surprise at the alacrity of Theresa’s departure.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She conducted the woman all her best wishes and, after a moment of hesitation, signed it Your Duchess Regent.</p> <p class="p6">The letter went out on the evening mail coach, and very well might arrive at Theresa’s London address before the woman herself would.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Amelia resigned herself to wait for the response and climbed into a bed that had never felt more empty.</p> <hr /> <p class="p6">It was a week later—no letter—that Gregory looked up at Amelia on their morning walk and asked, “Why does our mother not want to see us?”</p> <p class="p6">The lady in question had just come into view, sitting atop another hillock with her stool and easel, probably distant enough to feel unreachable to the boy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Amelia gave him a weak smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I don’t know if that’s true, dear.”</p> <p class="p6">“It is,” opined Eustace from where he was, from a standing position, rolling himself along the side of the hedgerow that followed the path.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Amelia had winced to watch him do so at first—the leaves were sharp and a little barbed—but he seemed to enjoy leaning into the shaped hedge, and it had become unremarkable over time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She still had to pluck leaves out of his hair before they returned to the house, though.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Mother doesn’t like us.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Father did, but he didn’t like being at home.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He paused his rolling and walked alongside them, brow furrowed as he thought.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Perhaps he only liked us in small portions, and that’s why he disliked staying at home too long.”</p> <p class="p6">“Your father was a very busy man,” Amelia heard herself say.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“He had great ambition.”</p> <p class="p6">Eustace gave her a look.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Did you know him?”</p> <p class="p6">Did she know her own brother?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She was surprised by the answer: “Not well.”</p> <p class="p6">“But Mother,” Gregory reminded the both of them as to the part of the conversation he cared about.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“If she didn’t see us all day, she’d be happy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All week!”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He looked uncertainly from Amelia to Eustace and back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Does she not like us?”</p> <p class="p6">Amelia sighed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She had resolved not to lie to the boys, especially after hearing the ice cream story, but this was more than fraught.</p> <p class="p6">Looking down at either of them, on either side of her—they’d both linked hands with her at some point in the conversation—she remembered her own youth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Raised as a boy, told nothing about motherhood, about womanhood: such details had been withheld like sacred mysteries.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And when she had finally become herself and other women began speaking with her in confidence under the aegis of their shared sex… all those mysteries had been revealed as tragedies of circumstance and social pressure.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Secrets not shared with boys because of shame, and probably the hope of preserving their childish innocence by maintaining their boyish ignorance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And then the boys grow into men (most of the time, at least) and stride through the world, largely unaware of the extent to which they walk through a garden of tragedies.</p> <p class="p6">Amelia wanted better for her boys.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Wanted better <i>from</i> her boys.</p> <p class="p6">“Not all women are maternal in nature,” she said carefully.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Both boys’ heads snapped up to listen, having apparently resigned themselves, in her long pause, to adult silence instead of an actual answer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“But most are forced to have children.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And when you are not maternal by nature, but have motherhood chosen for you… it can be… uncomfortable.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She squeezed their hands.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Which is very different from not loving her children.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Does that make sense?”</p> <p class="p6">“No,” came Eustace’s immediate reply.</p> <p class="p6">“The two of you love each other,” Amelia tried again.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’ve seen it, don’t even try to pretend otherwise.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But you are not always kind to each other.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Especially when you are tired, or hungry, or angry about a missing grenadier.”</p> <p class="p6">Gregory giggled; Eustace had lost a toy soldier the day before and had made it everyone’s problem.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’d blamed Gregory until his younger brother found the painted lead figurine under Eustace’s pillow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The elder boy muttered darkly and performatively, but Amelia thought she’d caught an embarassed smile on his lips before he looked pointedly away.</p> <p class="p6">“Imagine you are always angry,” she went on, “about something that you can’t change and never will be changed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Imagine how that might make you act, even with those you love.”</p> <p class="p6">Eustace growled, “So Mother is angry she had us?”</p> <p class="p6">Gregory double-stepped to look across Amelia to his brother.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Mother is angry about losing Father,” he corrected quietly.</p> <p class="p6">Their governess could have left it at that, but it felt like a half-truth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Both can be true,” she told them gently.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“She is very angry about losing your father.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She is also angry that the life she thought she’d have… never quite happened.”</p> <p class="p6">“She wanted to go paint on the Continent,” Eustace said, remembering the overheard altercation in the conservatory.</p> <p class="p6">“Life is often unkind to women with ambitions outside of being a wife and a mother,” she told them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“So perhaps you can understand why they might be angry.”</p> <p class="p6">“Is that why you’re a governess?” asked Gregory.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Instead of a wife and mother?”</p> <p class="p6">Amelia found her lips twisting ruefully.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I may yet marry,” she said, even if the words felt like knives coming up her throat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And may even raise children of my own.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But in the mean time—” she squeezed their hands again “—I am quite content borrowing the two of you.”</p> <p class="p6">Gregory giggled, and even Eustace looked up at her with a smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The elder boy detached himself to roll along the hedgerow again; his brother pulled on Amelia’s hand.</p> <p class="p6">Amelia bent down and Gregory cupped his hands around her ear to share a secret: “I wish that you were our mother.”</p> <p class="p6">She couldn’t help herself scooping up the boy to give him a crushing hug.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She also took that time to try to think of a good response to the boy’s pronouncement, not that she found one.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Instead, she said: “If I do ever get to raise a child, I hope they’ll be half as sweet as you.”</p> <hr /> <p class="p6"><i>My dear D. R.—</i></p> <p class="p6"><i>Your company this last week did me more good than I have the talent to express in a letter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You are a woman of many charms, and I am both glad and honoured to have enjoyed them.</i></p> <p class="p6"><i>I also enjoyed spending time with your young charges, who do your attention and tutelage great credit.</i></p> <p class="p6"><i>In your recent letter you asked after my precipitous departure.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I do apologize if I seemed to act in haste.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I had delivered Mr. Hawley’s box of lenses (and that gentlemen was eager to have it promptly returned along with Eustace’s order) as well as performed my London history for the boys.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My charges fulfilled and with no wish to overstay my welcome, I took my leave.</i></p> <p class="p6"><i>On that subject of welcome, please conduct my thanks to Lady Suffolk; her hospitality was nothing short of superlative, especially since she did not know me from Eve.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I cannot imagine I will enjoy such hospitality again, but I will always look fondly on my time there.</i></p> <p class="p6"><i>Yours,</i></p> <p class="p6"><i>Theresa Chesterley</i></p> <p class="p6">The damn letter, which had taken more than two full weeks to materialise, prompted more questions than it answered.</p> <p class="p6">It offered some polite admiration, but the missive seemed absent any affection.</p> <p class="p6">Overstay her welcome?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hadn’t Amelia made it clear to Theresa that “Youngest” had made it clear to Mother that she should be afforded every hospitality?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Three days fell well short of that mark!</p> <p class="p6">At least Theresa had not used the easily available phrasing that she had no reason to stay once box and history were delivered. That may have crushed Amelia’s heart to paste.</p> <p class="p6">Amelia read the letter over again, more than once.</p> <p class="p6">Between the oblique references to ‘charms’ and abbreviating ‘Duchess Regent,’ did she think that Amelia’s post was being read?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(For a moment, she considered if her mother would actually read the governess’s post, only to conclude that if she had done so, she would not have bothered to re-affix the wax seal.)</p> <p class="p6">Worst of all, nowhere did Theresa suggest or even imply that they should ever repeat the experience.</p> <p class="p6">Amelia considered dashing the letter into the fire.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Instead, she read it again.</p> <hr /> <p class="p7">“Miss Wright, a word,” called Mother one evening after dinner.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Iris had just swept out the door after half an hour of tight-lipped conversation and avoiding eye contact.</p> <p class="p7">Amelia had risen from her seat but not yet left the room, which left her standing while the Lady Suffolk still sat at her place at the head of the table.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Exactly as her mother had planned, no doubt; her daughter repressed a smirk.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Yes, milady?”</p> <p class="p7">“I couldn’t help but notice that young Eustace has taken to reading with spectacles,” the lady noted, voice strangely even and for once unreadable.</p> <p class="p7">“Yes, milady,” Amelia answered with a smile. If Mother disapproved—thought spectacles inappropriate for a boy, or for a future lord—she had to quash that impulse with as much enthusiasm and cheer as she could squeeze into the conversation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“They make reading much easier for him, and he’s discovered a surprising enthusiasm for the written word.”</p> <p class="p7">Mother sniffed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“The enthusiasms of boys are fickle things.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We shall see how long his infatuation lasts.”</p> <p class="p7">Amelia bobbed her head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“As you say, milady.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But I have my hopes.”</p> <p class="p7">“Where did they come from?” the lady asked next.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“The spectacles, not your tenuous hopes.”</p> <p class="p7">“Miss Chesterley brought them with her,” she answered with another smile, but this one went brittle entirely too quickly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With a knot in her stomach, she said, “That was the chief purpose of her visit.” Not, apparently, seeing Amelia, according to Theresa herself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She realized she was still talking: “She collected a box of spectacles of various powers from a Mister Hawley, along with instructions—“</p> <p class="p7">Mother waved a hand; she didn’t want these particulars.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Mister Hawley was convinced to part with an entire box of precision-ground lenses so that an untrained woman could try them on a boy still in short pants?”</p> <p class="p7">Convinced, yes, by a large sum of money that Julian had arranged to sit in surety that the box would come back intact.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hawley had wanted to come, himself; Amelia had wanted an excuse for Theresa to visit.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But her mother didn’t need to hear those particulars, either.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She pasted on a smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I understand your Youngest directed Mister Clark to arrange the details.”</p> <p class="p7">Her Mother shook her head softly, looking towards the door out of the dining room.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I thought he’d never read,” she breathed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“A dullard and, inevitably, an ignoramus.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In line to inherit.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I had steeled myself for such… disappointment to the family name.”</p> <p class="p7">Amelia stilled where she stood.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her Mother had never been so candid, not with the governess foisted into her household.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She felt like if she moved, she’d startle the lady out of her confession.</p> <p class="p7">“I’ve met many men of name and title,” the lady went on, “and in most of them, I think, I could find something to respect.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But there are always some who fall short of the… rather generous standard I extend to gentlemen.” She nodded to the dining room door, to the house beyond, to Eustace’s bedroom, upstairs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I thought he’d be one of them.”</p> <p class="p7">Her mother’s gaze flicked from the door to Amelia, and the lady smoothed away the storm of emotion on her face.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Perhaps a fresh perspective on the boy and his tutelage was not so bad an idea after all.”</p> <p class="p7">Amelia smiled softly and dropped a gentle curtsy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was as close to a compliment as she expected to get from the lady of the house.</p> <p class="p7">When her mother smirked in response, Amelia tamped down her surprise.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When she then chuckled softly, Amelia willed herself to not look out the windows to see if the world was ending.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“How did Youngest even know to do it?” her mother asked in wonder.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It could not have been you, Miss Wright; there simply hasn’t been the time for you to see Eustace’s struggle, send post to Iceland, and then Mister Clark to receive a reply and arrange the details for Miss Chesterley’s visit last week.”</p> <p class="p7">Amelia’s mouth went dry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How had she been so careless?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Too much, too fast; she’d shown her hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How much did her mother suspect?</p> <p class="p7">But Mother was saying, “Youngest was always perceptive.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And curious about so many things.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What impressive foresight, don’t you think, Miss Wright?”</p> <p class="p7">Was this a trap?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or was her mother actually complimenting her, albeit more directly than she thought she was?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She nodded, swallowing so that she could reply.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Yes, milady.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And clear sight for Eustace.”</p> <p class="p7">The lady of the house bestowed a tight smile on her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Quite.” She rose from her own seat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Now all you have to do, Miss Wright, is cram three years of reading into three months, before term begins.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I imagine you have your work cut out for you.”</p> <p class="p7">Amelia dropped another curtsy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She knew a dismissal when she heard it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Indeed, milady.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Good evening.”</p> <p class="p7">“Sleep well, Miss Wright,” her Mother bade her, already moving towards the door.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You’ll need to be well-rested to dive into all those books in the morning.”</p> <hr /> <p class="p7">Perhaps because of her mother’s encouragement, Amelia packed three different books for Eustace to read under the shade of their favourite copse of trees the following day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She tried not to push too hard, and he gamefully attempted all of them, to various degrees of success and interest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Eventually it was his brother who peeled him away to play muskateers with sticks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Amelia let them fence, considering it a productive day.</p> <p class="p7">An hour later, the three of them turned the last corner in the path that eventually led them back to the house.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There before them was Iris, easel and canvas over her back, bag of paints and brushes at her side.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Also returning to the house, she was perhaps fifty feet ahead of them and moving slower; it would only be a matter of time before they caught up.</p> <p class="p7">“Mother!” Gregory shouted and ran to greet her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even after their long walk and the dozen or so trees he’d climbed, the boy was still a ball of energy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Despite his enthusiastic scramble, however, Amelia could detect the hitch of tension in his shoulders.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Would his mother be happy he was invading her walk back to the house?</p> <p class="p7">Iris paused and turned toward him, too far ahead for Amelia to read her expression.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He wrapped his arms around her middle, causing her to throw her arm and elbow out to balance herself under her painterly load.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Nearly dropping her precious supplies might have upset the lady, but Amelia could hear her laugh.</p> <p class="p7">The two of them exchanged a few words and then she handed Gregory her bag.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He took up the load as if it were a great honour, and strode forward with weighty purpose.</p> <p class="p7">By that time, Eustace had caught up with her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They talked for a moment and, after a noticeably longer hesitation, she handed over the easel and canvas.</p> <p class="p7">As Eustace tromped away, careful under her precious load, Amelia came up beside the lady.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Good afternoon, Lady Marbury.”</p> <p class="p7">“Miss Wright,” the lady replied, doing little more than acknowledging her presence.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But then the lady fell into step beside her.</p> <p class="p7">It was clear to Amelia that Iris had not made up her mind how to handle her, or if she even needed to be handled, after she had walked in on the late-night tryst three weeks past.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She alternated warm and cool, sometimes even going so far as to smile at the governess who’d promised to keep her secret.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Other times, however, Amelia caught her staring daggers across a room when she thought she was unobserved, and there had been a few curt, if not actually cutting, remarks over breakfast and dinner.</p> <p class="p7">All of which made Amelia’s job—her actual job, as the boy’s governess—that much more difficult.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There were a raft of things she wanted to discuss with her charges’ mother: major issues like her having lied to her children, rather cavalierly, for so long, as well minor issues like supplying the boys with adventure novels that were by no means academic in nature.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All of it was impossible to broach if Iris still viewed her with suspicion and distrust.</p> <p class="p7">More than anything, though, she wanted to encourage the lady to spend a little time with her children.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They shouldn’t be telling their governess of less than two months that they’d rather she were their mother.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The trio had a long history—the boys’ whole lives—and as dour as Eustace might be about his memories, Gregory’s rosier recollections strongly implied that it hadn’t all been frustration and neglect.</p> <p class="p7">If Iris wanted to grieve her husband by painting, that was fine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But surely she could check in with the boys most evenings, if only for a few minutes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It would make such a difference.</p> <p class="p7">And here was perhaps an opportunity: two brief, positive encounters with her boys, with the both of them industriously pattering ahead of them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They were good boys (most days), and perhaps she’d like to spend just a little more time with them.</p> <p class="p7">“They’re always so eager to help,” Amelia observed, with entirely unfeigned affection.</p> <p class="p7">“They are,” the other lady allowed. “When they’re not trying to kill each other.” The addendum was offered so drily it took Amelia a moment to realize the lady was amused.</p> <p class="p7">“Brothers,” Amelia smiled wanly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even if she hadn’t been one, she’d had one.</p> <p class="p7">Iris looked sidelong at her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Oh, I know all too well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I had five, growing up.”</p> <p class="p7">Amelia lifted her eyebrows.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Any sisters?”</p> <p class="p7">“None,” the lady groaned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I begged my father to send me away to a girls’ seminary, just to escape them all.”</p> <p class="p7">“I can only imagine.” And she had, even if her dreams at Eton had been more about being at any other school than that one.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A school for girls was so fantastic a dream that she had reserved it for the longest, loneliest nights.</p> <p class="p7">The boys had disappeared up ahead, ducking through a trellis-screened passage that led into the service yard and thence into the house.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Propriety be damned,” Iris scoffed, but it sounded a little like a chuckle around the edges.</p> <p class="p7">“They haunt the kitchens when they’re not out with me,” Amelia giggled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Gregory wakes up almost as early as Cook and ‘helps’ her by eating the tarts that aren’t pretty enough to be put on the platter.”</p> <p class="p7">“Surely Enid’s cook is not so sloppy as to make ugly tarts.”</p> <p class="p7">Amelia smirked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Not on accident, at least.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She likes spoiling him a little.” They’d reached the trellis, and she raised her eyebrows at Iris.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“The boys are right, though, that this is the quickest way inside.”</p> <p class="p7">The lady rolled her eyes, good-naturedly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I am just following my easel,” she explained, and ducked down the stone-lined path behind the trellis.</p> <p class="p7">The shade was cool and green, the morning’s brief rain still seeped into the brick wall that ran along one side of the servants’ passage.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Amelia could feel the tension unwind from her shoulders as she followed after Iris.</p> <p class="p7">But then the lady was brought up short, loosing a surprised and strangled cry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Amelia ran into her back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“What?”</p> <p class="p7">Before them the hidden servants’ passage widened, stacks of baskets stored along either side, and among them stood Mister Grant, the estate agent, and Mister Hawthorne, the estate shepherd.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Both were hurriedly pulling up their coats; Grant was trying to simultaneously tie his cravat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hawthorne’s short naval ponytail had come undone and his greying hair splayed out all around his face.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The men huffed and stammered, trying to find an excuse that would obscure the fact that they had just been pressed up against the wall, kissing.</p> <p class="p7">Mister Grant was, Amelia realized, trying to tie his cravat in order to hide the blossoming bruise of a love bite on his neck.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Lady Marbury, Miss Grant,” he said finally, and dipped his head in a little perfunctory bow.</p> <p class="p7">“Good afternoon, gentlemen,” Amelia answered, thinking: I have to stop walking in on people’s clandestine lovemaking.</p> <p class="p7">“We were just… inspecting the… baskets,” Hawthorne all but mumbled, knowing how ridiculous he sounded.</p> <p class="p7">“It’s perfectly clear what the two of you were doing,” Iris spat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Did my boys see—“</p> <p class="p7">“They tore through here at a gallop,” Grant answered with a shake of his head. “I don’t think they saw the baskets, let alone us.”</p> <p class="p7">“What are your names?” Iris asked, voice tight and resigned.</p> <p class="p7">Both men filled their lungs to answer, knowing that Iris would report them to the lady of the house, that they’d lose their positions, that they wouldn’t find another one, not at their age and not with the reputation that would follow them, that they were almost certainly looking at a future of penury in the form of Iris Sommerset.</p> <p class="p7">“We don’t need to know their names,” Amelia put in before either of them could answer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Iris looked back at her, eyebrow raised high.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She spoke quickly but gently: “Lady Marbury, they haven’t done anyone any harm.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We’re the ones who aren’t suposed to be here.” She bobbed her head at the men.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Excuse us for invading your privacy.”</p> <p class="p7">Iris stared at her, agog.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Miss Wright, we can’t just overlook—“</p> <p class="p7">Amelia nodded to the two men, hoping that they’d take the hint and take their leave so that they could not be interrogated for their names.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She said soothing things to Iris, trying to talk her down.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s nothing to worry yourself over, milady.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The heart wants what it wants.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Who are we to judge?”</p> <p class="p7">But the Lady Marbury’s eyes flashed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“The heart wants…?” she sputtered.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You wouldn’t dare.”</p> <p class="p7">“Just let them go, milady,” Amelia pleaded, and was pleased to see the two men were, indeed, creeping backwards out of the awkward scene.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I promise nobody will be scandalized.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Nobody has to know.”</p> <p class="p7">Amelia’s mouth was running like a babbling brook, simultaneously trying to distract and placate the lady. She nearly said again, “The heart wants what it wants,” and stumbled to a stop.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The last time she’d said the same to Iris, she’d just walked in on the woman’s tryst with the Master of Stable.</p> <p class="p7">Iris evidently remembered the phrase, and drew exactly the wrong conclusion as to what the governess meant to imply with her repetition.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Amelia’s silence for that night—in exchange for Iris’ silence today.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But before Amelia could clarify, Iris backed away.</p> <p class="p7">“Nobody has to know,” the lady echoed, all but snarling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Fine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As you like it, Miss Wright.” And without looking back, she stalked away, back out of the servant’s passage, out to the grounds, and presumably to a respectable door on the ground floor.</p> <div class="wi_authornotes"> <div> <div class="p-avatar-wrap"><a class="avatar has-link" href="https://scribblehub.com/profile/149271/miriamrobern/"><img id="acc_ava_change profile" alt="" src="https://cdn.scribblehub.com/avatar/s/37/ava_149271_1743989956.jpg"></a></div> <p><span class="an_username"><a href="https://scribblehub.com/profile/149271/miriamrobern/">miriamrobern</a></span></div> <div style="clear: both;"></div> <div class="wi_authornotes_body"> <h2><b>Thanks for Reading!</b><b></b></h2> <p class="p8">If you’d like to see more like this, please consider subscribing to my patreon at http://patreon.com/miriamrobern</p> <ul class="ul1"> <li class="li9">I post all chapters a month early for subscribers, so you can read ahead.</li> <li class="li9">I also post epub and pdf versions of the book for everybody.</li> </ul> <p class="p8">Thanks for your support, whether it’s becoming a subscriber or posting comments online.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s people like you who let people like me make stuff like this!</p> </div></div></p> </div>

whole slate of events planned out for Sammy, starting just two days later.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She shoved a multi-appointment calendar invite into his inbox, and without thinking, he just clicked Accept All.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>First his week of orderly coloured blocks were invaded by more, overlapping blocks, and then the stream of notifications about conflicts made his phone and laptop start dinging repeatedly, in chorus.</p> <p class="p2">Rowan had made at least a token gesture of avoiding Sammy’s actual classes—mostly—as well as his voice training lesson.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But she apparently thought any other scrap of time, especially through the evenings, was fair game.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Time that Sammy had set aside for reading, for revising essays, for preparing for quizzes—all of it—got bulldozed under Rowan’s plans.</p> <p class="p2">Sammy considered begging off a few of these—what was a Drag Brunch, anyway?—but by the way Rowan’s stream of excited texts kept making his phone buzz long after the tide of schedule conflicts receded, he knew it would be a futile effort.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He let her burble away, scowled at his schedule, and started shifting things around.</p> <p class="p2">There were some things that were more precautionary review than they were deadline-driven projects, and he could skip those for a week.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Everything else he shuffled around to make space.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He could also wake up early on Saturday, tomorrow, to get stuff done before Pride took over everything.</p> <p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">Okay, I’m really excited about all of this</span>,</strong> he told her once her tour guide monologue had ground to a halt.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’d barely registered any of the specifics, but he had cleared the time, theoretically.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><strong><span class="s1">But if you’re gonna drag me all over the City all next week, I’ve got an essay to write and reading to do.</span></strong></p> <p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">Aren’t you an adorably diligent little school girl</span>,</strong> she responded, and he could hear her laughter.</p> <p class="p5"><strong>See you Sunday.</strong></p> <p class="p2">As a final parting shot, she told him: <strong><span class="s1">Wear something skimpy!</span></strong></p> <hr /> <p class="p2">Rowan led him down the street towards the noise and the gathering crowd, then leapt up onto a concrete planter at the corner to throw out her hands across the whole scene.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Our people, Sammy!”</p> <p class="p2">Long rows of square canopies lined either side of the street, with a vast mob of colorfully-dressed people flowing between them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The result was basically a sluice of rainbow polyester, bared skin, and sweat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Music pounded from somewhere down the way; the smell of beer and fried food filled the air.</p> <p class="p2">The Brooklyn Pride Multicultural Festival looked a whole lot like the Hunterdon County Fair that he’d volunteered at every year, except three or four times as big and infinitely more queer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Couples wandered up and down the stalls—two men, two women, various gender rebels, even apparent straight people—all holding hands, all laughing companionably at each other, a whole lot of them kissing or just straight-up making out in public.</p> <p class="p2">He’d had a complicated relationship with the County Fair.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It had once been exciting, when he was little and easily impressed; but in later years it had grown… intimidating, with too many people giving him too many appraising looks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Trying to figure him out, how he fit into everything else, and usually how hard they could dismiss him for being so patently out of place.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He still went, still did his part for the scout troop and the mini golf course they ran, but he hardly ever ventured far from the course, and went home immediately once his shift was done.</p> <p class="p2">At the first look at the sea of people, Sammy’s heart leapt up into his chest, and for a moment he thought he’d have to tamp down the familiar almost-panic that the Fair crowd had triggered in him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But he breathed, and looked, and realized that the looming vibe of intimidation was missing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He wasn’t here to Have Fun or Else, he wasn’t here to fulfill the role of Dutiful Boy Scout Performing Community Service.</p> <p class="p2">Rowan stepped down off the planter, grinning and holding out her hand to pull him in.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was invited.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was welcome.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There were so many people here just like him.</p> <p class="p2">He took her hand and dove into the crowd.</p> <p class="p2">“So don’t say it out loud,” Rowan told him a little while later, leaning conspiratorially close, “but this is like… baby pride.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Neighbourhood pride.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s cute, and they do their parade in the evening, which is, seriously, so obviously sensible I don’t know why everybody else doesn’t do the same.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No heat stroke, what a revelation!”</p> <p class="p2">But Sammy was hung up on ‘baby pride,’ looking around at the sea of rainbowed humanity that they swam through.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“This is small?”</p> <p class="p2">“Compared to the real deal?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is tiny,” she nodded.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“But it’s also, you know, comfy and homey.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even if you don’t actually live in Brooklyn.”</p> <p class="p2">They hit up the food trucks and came away with their hands full of fried food, then meandered their way through the stalls.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>About half presented local organizations with ties to the queer community—some, like the Queer Street Opera, more significant than others, like the Brooklyn Credit Union.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The other half sold merchandise, mostly clothes and hand-made art.</p> <p class="p2">It was in the latter half that they spent the most time, poring through racks of brightly-coloured clothing and tables spread with wind chimes, blown-glass bongs, and incense holders.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rowan kept showing him items bearing the trans pride colours, insisting that he needed some “trans bling.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He begged off each time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What would he do with trans pride stuff once he detransitioned, anyway?</p> <p class="p2">But he was absolutely surrounded by people decked out in rainbows or bearing other pride flag colour schemes—when they weren’t just trailing a pride flag off their shoulders like a cape—and he found he was not immune to the ambient peer pressure.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He started looking at rainbow things, and for the much more rarer pink-yellow-blue of the pansexual pride flag.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was still a little shaky on which labels he qualified for or wanted to claim, but maybe if he found just the right thing, it would tip him over the threshold.</p> <p class="p2">He held up a likely cardigan—featuring chunky bands of pink, yellow, and blue, even if they weren’t quite the right pink, yellow, and blue—and wrinkled his nose into a tall, thin mirror propped up on the clothing rack.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was pretty sure it would stretch across his tits rather nicely, but was that enough if the colours were off?</p> <p class="p2">“You’d look awesome in that,” came a voice to his right, and he glanced over to answer with a polite little smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’d assumed it was the owner of the stall, but this girl looked like she’d just walked in from the thoroughfare.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her eyes dipped down and back up, appraising, and licked her lips.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“But I bet you look awesome in most things.”</p> <p class="p2">“Oh, um, thanks,” he stammered, and could feel his ears burning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The girl was hot and, as if that weren’t enough, wasn’t wearing very much at all.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I, um, er—”</p> <p class="p2">Before he could fumble for any more words, Rowan interposed herself between Sammy and the newcomer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Sorry, she’s taken,” she declared with a wide grin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Happy Pride!”</p> <p class="p2">The girl took a moment to size up Rowan, and stepped back with a smirk.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Can’t blame a girl for trying,” she said, and then nodded farewell to the both of them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Happy Pride.”</p> <p class="p2">Rowan waited until she was out of earshot before giggling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I forgot to mention: the lesbians will be on the hunt.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She gestured out across the festival.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Target-rich environment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Safe bet most girls here are into girls.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She poked him in the side.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You coupled up a week too early.”</p> <p class="p2">“I’ll take notes for next year,” he giggled.</p> <p class="p2">“Actually, I just assumed, but are you guys exclusive?” Rowan asked, pawing through a basket full of bangles in various primary colours.</p> <p class="p2">Sammy paused in his perusal of the maybe-pansexual top.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I don’t actually know.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Back home, girlfriend just <i>means</i>exclusive, but that’s probably not a good assumption here.”</p> <p class="p2">“Or with Finn,” Rowan bobbed her head.</p> <p class="p2">Sammy decided that, colours slight off or no, the sweater’s long sleeves were going to be impossible in the summer heat, so he didn’t need it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He returned it to the rack.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I don’t think I’d mind too much if we weren’t,” he was surprised to hear himself say.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s a temporary thing, anyway.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They’re destined to find somebody else in California, and I’ll be happy for them when that happens.”</p> <p class="p2">“Just as long as they smooch you a lot now,” Rowan grinned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He smiled back, with a little self-conscious nod.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Spying his vulnerability and her opportunity, she then added, “…and give you a good fucking every few days.”</p> <p class="p2">He rolled his eyes and left the stall, primarily to hide what felt like the fire-engine-red blush taking over his face.</p> <p class="p2">At the end of the block, the festival terminated with another circle of food trucks, so they grabbed a “bouquet” of pickles to share.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rowan made a joke about trans girls and pickles that Sammy didn’t quite understand, but let slide unexplained.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was too focused on watching the crowd, and watching the crowd watch him, and marvelling.</p> <p class="p2">Rowan had gleefully informed two more girls that Sammy was taken, and then when one of the girls mistook Rowan for Sammy’s girlfriend and suggested all three of them have some fun together, turned that offer down, too.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And that was both funny and kind of awesome, but it was also just the tip of the iceberg.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lesbians on the hunt or no, when people looked at Sammy here, it seemed to work differently than other places and other times.</p> <p class="p2">They didn’t see some awkward brown kid who stuck out.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They didn’t have questions about who he was or what he was doing there.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was just another queer, in a sea of queers, and there was a delight in most everyone’s eyes, of seeing another queer, maybe saying Happy Pride or that’s a fabulous skirt you’re wearing, and it was all permitted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was all so normal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was like a parallel reality, a private little world just for queers, carved out of a Brooklyn street.</p> <p class="p2">Pride was special.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He got it now.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It made perfect sense to set aside a whole week for this every year for the rest of his life.</p> <p class="p2">“Our people,” he murmured to himself, a little hesitantly, and couldn’t help smiling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“My people.”</p> <hr /> <p class="p2">The next evening, Sammy looked left and right as they stepped into the hotel lobby.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“This is a Pride thing?” he asked Rowan uncertainly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There were no flamboyant costumes, no acres of skin on display, no melange of body odour, sunscreen, and cannabis wafting through the aggressively-conditioned air.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was just a scrupulously clean hotel lobby.</p> <p class="p2">“This is a Pride thing,” his cousin confirmed, striding across the lobby to jam an elevator call button.</p> <p class="p2">He read the logo over the elevator doors.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“What the fuck is a skylawn?”</p> <p class="p2">“It’s a very ostentatious name for a roof that’s only three stories above street level,” she responded with a roll of her eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The doors opened and they stepped inside; once the doors closed, she rooted around in her purse.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Oh, you’ll need this.”</p> <p class="p2">He took the proferred card from her hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Why do I need some rando’s New York driver’s licence?”</p> <p class="p2">“That’s your New York driver’s license,” she corrected him with a laugh.</p> <p class="p2">He snorted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Rowan, this doesn’t even look like me.”</p> <p class="p2">She shrugged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Don’t worry, your cleavage will make up the difference.”</p> <p class="p2">“And it says I’m 24!” he blurted as the elevator chimed and the doors opened.</p> <p class="p2">Rowan leaned closer to whisper as she pulled him out of the elevator and into the evening air.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“That is the purpose of a fake ID, Sammy.”</p> <p class="p2">“Good evening, ladies,” called a smiling attendant behind a kiosk.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The rooftop was festooned with fairy lights and little potted shrubberies, the latter of which had been positioned to create a little foyer area, complete with hostess kiosk.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Tickets and IDs, please.”</p> <p class="p2">Rowan strode up to the kiosk, presenting her phone with a barcode showing and then her own fake ID.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With his own already in hand, Sammy mutely held out the card to the attendant.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Unable to make eye contact with her, he instead looked over at the array of chairs that took up most of the roof.</p> <p class="p2">“Thank you very much,” the attendant smiled and gestured them through.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Welcome to the Rooftop Cinema Club.”</p> <p class="p2">It was only then that Sammy spied the movie screen stretched out across the next building over, and the fat outdoor speakers mounted along the sides of the grid of chairs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The chairs which all faced the screen, and were all, obviously, audience seating.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a movie theatre, except on a rooftop.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Holy shit,” he breathed.</p> <p class="p2">“Innit cool?” Rowan grinned, and then grabbed his hand to pull him across the space, past the seating area.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Ah, there’s the bar.”</p> <p class="p2">They both ordered cocktails with a side of popcorn, a juxtaposition which made Sammy giggle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He tried to present his ID again, but that was unnecessary, apparently.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You can put that away,” she told him quietly as they navigated to their seats.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Only show it when you need to.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You don’t want somebody to look too hard and get you tossed out.”</p> <p class="p2">So not as foolproof as all that, he noted absently.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Popcorn tucked into his elbow and cocktail held awkwardly in hand, he dropped the card into his purse.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was amazed he hadn’t spilled booze all over some unsuspecting, already-seated moviegoer, and took a deep pull to make that less likely in the future.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He blinked; the drink was strong.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Wow, that’s—” he almost coughed, and then covered, “um, tasty.”</p> <p class="p2">“They make great drinks here,” Rowan agreed, settling into her seat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“So you’ve never seen this?”</p> <p class="p2">He sat gingerly, succeeding in spilling neither alcohol nor popcorn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Um.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I didn’t really watch a lot of cheerleader movies in Oak Grove.”</p> <p class="p2">“It’s not a cheerleader movie,” she giggled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Thats just kind of tangential.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or I dunno, not really.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s part of the main character’s thing, and—oh, but I don’t want to spoil anything for you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s great.”</p> <p class="p2">“What is the whole title, again?” he asked as the lights dimmed and the screen flickered on.</p> <p class="p2">“<i>But I’m a Cheerleader!</i>” Rowan stage-whispered, eyes sparkling in the half-light.</p> <hr /> <p class="p2">“She didn’t know,” he was telling Rowan as the lights came back up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was dimly aware that he was slurring his words, and more than a little.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rowan had kept fetching them more cocktails throughout the movie.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“She didn’t knooow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Everybody around her knew, but she didn’t.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She thought she was just… doing what everybody expected of her, so therefore she had to be, or I mean she thought she had to be, what everybody expected of her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But she wasn’t.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He looked up at the dead screen.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“She never was.”</p> <p class="p2">Rowan lolled, loose-limbed, in her own chair, smiling beautifically.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Right?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And then she figures it out.”</p> <p class="p2">“She figures it out, and then they’re happy.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sammy’s thoughts skipped like a stone across a pond.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“That place they went to, though, was so silly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Are there places like that, really?”</p> <p class="p2">“Conversion camps or gay bars?” Rowan snorted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Doesn’t matter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yes, they both exist, but they’re a lot less silly than in the movie.”</p> <p class="p2">He snorted, which made his nose feel funny.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I know gay bars exist.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We’re going to one tomorrow, right?”</p> <p class="p2">Rowan stood up—carefully—and looked down at him with a grin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Assuming your hangover doesn’t fucking kill you in the morning.”</p> <hr /> <p class="p2">“Are we sure this is necessary?” he asked again while they shuffled along in the slow-moving line.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His head was pounding, and the cute little round sunglasses he had on barely cut the morning light that was trying to stab out his eyeballs.</p> <p class="p2">“Necessary?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No,” answered Uncle Henry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Fun?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yes.”</p> <p class="p2">“It’s also kind of a family tradition,” Uncle Gideon put in from further up the line.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“We’re so happy to have you with us this year, Samantha.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>From the poorly-hidden smirks his uncles shared with each other, his condition was not lost on either of them.</p> <p class="p2">“We’ll get you a little hair of the dog once we’re inside,” Rowan promised, patting his elbow gently.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“That’ll help, I promise.”</p> <p class="p2">It was an age before they got to the front of the line and Gideon brandished their tickets, each one printed on a separate piece of printer paper.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The ticket-taker, dressed in a sequined dress and wearing a very bad wig, gave them all a manic grin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Welcome home, fam.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Grab whichever table you like.”</p> <p class="p2">It was a gay bar, attested by the rainbow lights everywhere that looked like they’d been up for years, not thrown onto the walls last week like every other bar in New York right now.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was not large, and for all the twinkle lights, neither was it well-lit.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Tables and chairs were scattered across the room, with a few wide aisles striking through the tumult.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An empty stage took up pride of place against the wall opposite the bar, and above it was spread a banner that read: Stonewall Inn.</p> <p class="p2">Sammy squinted at the banner as they sat down.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rowan ordered a round of mimosas and then a pitcher of the same to follow, and still he couldn’t resolve the tickle in the back of his brain.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Okay,” he finally hazarded, waving up at the wall.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I feel like I should be recognizing the name, but… I’m not exactly firing on all cylinders right now.”</p> <p class="p2">His uncles and cousin blinked at him as one.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Finally Henry stammered, “The— the Stonewall Inn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You don’t… recognize.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Stonewall.”</p> <p class="p2">Gideon put a gentle hand on his husband’s shoulder.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Did you know what Stonewall was when you were living in Oak Grove, honey?”</p> <p class="p2">Luckily the mimosas arrived then, and Rowan passed one to Sammy insistently.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“This is the Stonewall Inn, Sammy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s where everything began for queerdom.”</p> <p class="p2">“Not everything—” Gideon tried to interrupt.</p> <p class="p2">But Rowan waved a hand in his face.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Spare me your historical precision for a minute.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Turning back to Sammy, she said, “This is where the first Pride happened, and it was a riot.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She grinned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Like, a literal riot.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Queers fighting cops.”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy downed his mimosa and slowly poured another from the pitcher.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Both the fructose and the alcohol hit his bloodstream almost immediately, and it was like his whole body groaned in gratitude.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Wait, what? How did Pride go from that to…”—he waved at the door, indicating the whole of New York and the rainbows vomitted all over it—“what it is now?”</p> <p class="p2">“A lot of hard work by a lot of activists,” answered Gideon.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“But the spirit of the first Pride—that riot, where queers fought back against oppression—was what inspired a whole lot of it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And arguably kicked off the modern queer rights movement.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He tapped the table with splayed fingers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It all started here.”</p> <p class="p2">Uncle Henry nodded.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Which is why our family comes every year, for—”</p> <p class="p2">“It’s Drag Brunch, bitches!” shouted an announcer as she mounted the stage.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She held a bedazzled microphone in front of a face that had… a whole lot of makeup on it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sammy wasn’t even sure what, exactly, he was looking at.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Eye shadow spiked out to her ears, contouring gone absolutely mad, lipstick so vibrant it seemed to glow, and false eyelashes that he was pretty sure would kick up a breeze if she blinked.</p> <p class="p2">She was wearing a wig—it had to be a wig, right?—that was easily twice the size of her head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her golden sequinned gown shimmered under the stage lights, wrapped around curves so generous they had to be exaggerated.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Nor did Sammy miss her nails—not that she allowed anyone to miss her nails, the way she waved her hands around—which extended at least two inches from the tips of her fingers and were painted cheeto orange, with sparkles.</p> <p class="p2">For one brief moment, Sammy wondered if the mimosas had been spiked and he was experiencing a drug-induced hallucination.</p> <p class="p2">But the show went on, the announcer kept braying into the microphone, and the Roth-Masters all smiled and cheered like this was all perfectly normal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The woman on stage, who identified herself as Merri Mountains with a shake of her very solid bosom, promised a string of performances, encouraging the audience to cheer, to sing along, to tip generously, and to stay out of the aisles while the performers strutted their stuff around the room.</p> <p class="p2">“That reminds me,” grunted Uncle Henry, leaning forward to dig his wallet out of his back pocket.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He then unceremoniously dropped a stack of twenties on the table.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When Sammy boggled—it had to be a few hundred dollars—his uncle gestured up at Miss Mountains.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“For tips, like she said.”</p> <p class="p2">And then the announcer in question completed her schpiel, waved, and strutted off stage.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The coloured lights winked off, and the room dropped back into silverware-clicking muttering.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A server materialized beside the table.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“What can I get you?” she asked, and the Roth-Masters all studiously consulted the menus that Sammy hadn’t even noticed on the table.</p> <p class="p2">He reached a hesitant hand out to his cousin’s elbow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“R— Rowan.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ro.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What the fuck is happening?”</p> <p class="p2">She didn’t look up from the menu.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“They don’t have the waffles this year,” she told him as if that was an answer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“They used to make them with rainbow sprinkles; they were my favourite.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But I think the bennies are pretty good.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I forget who supplies the menu; it’s obviously not Stonewall’s kitchen doing the brunch.”</p> <p class="p2">“No, I mean—” he stammered, but then it was Rowan’s turn to order, and he didn’t want to interrupt.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He numbly opened his menu.</p> <p class="p2">“And for you, miss?” the server asked him not even thirty seconds later.</p> <p class="p2">“Um.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The eggs benedict?” he answered, having spied the first item on the list and connected it with Rowan’s vague recommendation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“With bacon.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The last was muscle memory, really, but you couldn’t go wrong with bacon.</p> <p class="p2">“I’ll have that out for you in a few minutes,” the server promised, collected the menus, and then the stage lights spun up.</p> <p class="p2">Spears of light in every colour of the rainbow danced across the stage and the wall behind it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A pop song started blaring through the room.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Another woman, in a costume just as colorful, curvy, and eye-gougingly sparkly, spun onto the stage and began lip-syncing to the lyrics.</p> <p class="p2">The performer was, Sammy was pretty sure, trans.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The announcer, too, and almost certainly the ticket-taking hostess at the door.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His eye for spotting tells had sharpened in recent weeks, but the women also didn’t seem to be avoiding them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Instead they seemed to call attention to each and every clocky tell they could by overdoing it: mammoth wigs, exagerrated makeup, generously padded underwear.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Their prancing was ludicrously swishy; their flirting—with literally everyone—full of farcically overblown mannerisms.</p> <p class="p2">The Roth-Masters hooted and cheered along with the rest of the crowd.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When the performer came down off the stage and into the crowd, still prancing and lip-syncing, all three of them scrambled to grab a twenty and wave it at her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When she came by, they stuffed the money into her fake cleavage and under her garter belts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All three of them were clearly having the time of their lives.</p> <p class="p2">Sammy profoundly didn’t get it.</p> <p class="p2">The first song drew to a close and in the brief respite following, their food was brought to the table.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The eggs benedict were rather good, but before he could get even halfway into them, new music started blaring, the announcer crowed a new silly name into the microphone, and another dancer strutted her way up onto the stage, shaking her ass and winking at everyone she passed by.</p> <p class="p2">He weathered the second performance, even picking up a twenty to wave at the dancer and slide into her garter belt, but it wasn’t pleasant.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At first he thought it was the too-loud music and his hangover, but as the performer broke out of her lip sync to catcall one of the customers eating brunch, he realized it was something else.</p> <p class="p2">Sammy looked sidelong at Rowan, thinking that she must be feeling what he was feeling, but his cousin was grinning and cheering and banging on the table.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He looked from her to the dancer and back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The difference was night and day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rowan was made up carefully, dressed immaculately, seamless and inarguably a young woman.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The dancer, by contrast, was all seams, all exagerration, playing up her man-in-a-dress schtick for laughs and tips.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was grotesque.</p> <p class="p2">When the music died down, Sammy tried to excuse himself to use the restroom, but Rowan invited herself along.</p> <p class="p2">The bathrooms were small—no surprise there—but Sammy pushed his way directly into a stall.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rowan hung by the sinks, checking her hair and lipstick.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“What do you think, Sammy?” she asked, all excitement.</p> <p class="p2">He sat on the toilet, skirt bunched up around his hips, not knowing what to say.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I shouldn’t be here.”</p> <p class="p2">“Oh come on, Sammy, you can miss one class,” she chided, good-naturedly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s only, what, Physics?”</p> <p class="p2">“It’s not that,” he told her through the partition, although now that he’d been reminded, he could worry about that, too.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I just… I’m not really enjoying the show.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I don’t think it’s my thing.”</p> <p class="p2">What he didn’t say was: I feel like each drag performer is mocking me, and worse, mocking you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Prancing around on display, laughing at the seams in their presentation, just in general doing really shitty job at being trans.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was as if they were declaring that this was the best any trans girl could hope for, that every effort to look like a girl was doomed to ludicrous failure.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The drag queens seemed to be inviting the whole world to laugh at them, and at Rowan, and at Sammy.</p> <p class="p2">“It doesn’t have to be your thing,” his cousin assured him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s kind of a queer culture thing, but you don’t have to enjoy every single thing about queer culture, you know?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You’ll never see me wearing fucking rainbows.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Pick a damn colour and commit, already.”</p> <p class="p2">That drew a chuckle out of Sammy, which brought back the ghost of his headache.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I might need more mimosa,” he grumbled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Hey wait.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We just… drunk a bunch of mimosas in front of your dads.”</p> <p class="p2">He could hear her shrug in her voice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“We’re adults, the venue didn’t card us, it’s not the dads’ responsibility to police our behaviour.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Besides, mimosas are hardly even drinking.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A moment later asked, “Are you actually peeing in there or just hiding from the drag show?”</p> <p class="p2">He thumped his head back against the wall.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Hiding.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or at least just catching my breath.”</p> <p class="p2">“You should have said, silly,” she laughed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You want some time alone?”</p> <p class="p2">“No, I feel silly enough already,” he told her with a sigh, and stood up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“How many more songs do you think there will be?”</p> <p class="p2">The answer was four: another new performer, then the ticket-taker hostess in her debut performance, followed by the announcer taking a turn, and lastly a duet-trio-quartet blowout finale.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was glitter in the last one, thrown by hand, which got absolutely everywhere.</p> <p class="p2">Afterwards the performers lined up by the door so the audience could gush about the performances and take pictures.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sammy’s family was the last group in the long line-up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some of the performers recognized the Roth-Masters from prior years, and his uncles insisted on taking pictures with everyone.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sammy let himself be roped in, not wanting to dampen their annual ritual.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He could still feel his shoulders slumping a little, though.</p> <p class="p2">The uncles were chatting up the ticket-taker, saying encouraging things about her number, leaving Sammy trapped behind them, standing next to Merri Mountains.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Feeling awkward, he raised a fist and said, “Trans pride solidarity.”</p> <p class="p2">But Merri laughed it off.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Oh honey, I’m not trans.”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy scowled, checked that the rest of his family was still engrossed in conversation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You’re not?”</p> <p class="p2">She—or maybe he?—shook her head, paired with a quiet smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“No honey, I’m a cis gay man.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She splayed a hand across her very-obviously-fake-up-close cleavage.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Merri Mountains is a performance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s camp.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s all the things that we’re not supposed to do, according to the world of the straights, piled together into a disco dance number.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s raising a middle finger at expectations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Which is half of what Pride is about, you know?”</p> <p class="p2">“Yeah, but…” he protested, verbally staggering until he waved a hand at her whole get-up, and the rest of the performers, for good measure.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It sure looks trans.”</p> <p class="p2">“I mean, some of us are,” the drag queen allowed with a shrug.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“At least for a little while.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Clarice over there, in the red?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She nodded down the line to one of the other performers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“She performed for years before she realized she was a woman, and started transitioning a few months ago.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This will be her last performance.”</p> <p class="p2">“She’s quitting?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Why?”</p> <p class="p2">Merri laughed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Because it’s not drag, anymore.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sure, she could maybe do a drag king routine, drag celebrities or something, or just shift over into burlesque, but… once she figured herself out, I think performing lost some of its lustre for her.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She smiled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“She’s so much happier, now, though.”</p> <p class="p2">The uncles were saying what sounded like the beginnings of actual goodbyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“This was my first drag show,” he told Merri.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And I… didn’t really get it.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She only nodded.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“But maybe I’ll understand it better next time.”</p> <p class="p2">“That’s the spirit!”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She clapped him on the shoulder like Andrei liked to.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He staggered, chuckled at the thought that Merri was betraying a little of her buried masculinity, and then caught her eye.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She gave him a look, and he realized: the gesture had been just as much a part of her performance as any shimmy to the beat or lilting flirt with an audience member.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She peaked one eyebrow: she saw that he saw, and she winked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“See you then, honey.”</p> <hr /> <p class="p2">“I told you that you’d eventually need an evening gown,” Rowan grinned, unzipping the garment bag and then clapping her hands as tulle spilled out everywhere.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The two of them were in her bedroom, getting ready.</p> <p class="p2">He stood behind her in a comparatively simple outfit: just a cami and a skirt, with some strappy sandals.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was planning on wearing the sandals with the gown and had just worn them over to Rowan’s, which she chided him for, even if she couldn’t really explain why he should have needlessly switched shoes, too.</p> <p class="p2">Rowan seemed intent on making this an event, even more than the rest of the Pride festivities she’d lined up for them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sammy was just going with the flow.</p> <p class="p2">They’d found the evening gown—three weeks back, now—in a second-hand boutique that still had prices larger than anything Sammy had ever seen in Abby’s little clothing store back home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The strapless bodice and skirt were a deep shimmery red, scarlet at the bustline but brightening to cardinal at the bottom hem, with coils of white tulle studded with little red sequins.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It seemed to Sammy to be a bit much, and by a bit, his brain meant a whole lot.</p> <p class="p2">It also didn’t have pockets.</p> <p class="p2">On the other hand, Sammy had found some pearlescent hair clips that would set off nicely.</p> <p class="p2">Rowan insisted that they both do a full face.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She’d wheeled Gideon’s office chair into her bedroom and propped her full-length mirror sideways on her computer desk so they could work side-by-side.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sammy sat down to humor her, but once they were underway he found himself enjoying the process, doing makeup alongside his cousin, each step sprinkled with light chit-chat, compliments, and pointers.</p> <p class="p2">When they were both near done, Gideon rapped on the door and stuck his head in.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Your dates are here.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So are Agatha and Zoey.”</p> <p class="p2">“Well tell the girls to come up,” Rowan told her father as if that were obvious.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Are you or Daddy going to do the shotgun talk?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Here she waggled her arms, elbows out, to poorly imitate a masculine swagger while still seated.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“‘You’d better treat my daughter and niece proper if you know what’s good for you’ and all that?”</p> <p class="p2">Gideon snorted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m more worried what the two of you will do to them, poor things.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He smiled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Samantha, you look stunning, and once you’re in that dress?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You’re going to knock their socks off.”</p> <p class="p2">Their faces were finished by the time Aggie and Zoey got to the room, and then there was another round of compliments.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The couple had gone with simple sheath dresses, Aggie in white and Zoey in black, with chunky necklaces in the opposite color.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They looked adorable, and plainly a couple, and not at all overdressed, which is what Sammy knew he was going to be momentarily.</p> <p class="p2">Rowan and Zoey helped him step into his gown while Agatha righted the full-length mirror.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He zipped up his side, smoothed the lines over his hips, and turned to face his reflection.</p> <p class="p2">“Holy fuck,” he breathed in wonder.</p> <p class="p2">The full-length mirror showed a girl decked out to the nines, looking a little shocked but otherwise… good.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He looked good; that was as much as he would allow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’d been expecting the worst, and it wasn’t that, and he was just surprised, was all, that he didn’t look like a shimmery trainwreck.</p> <p class="p2">The girls wouldn’t stop cooing over him, so he declared he was going downstairs.</p> <p class="p2">“He’s a doctor,” Gideon was saying, voice wobbling on the brink of laughter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“He knows how to dispose of bodies.”</p> <p class="p2">“Which is good, because I don’t think we even own a shovel,” Henry rejoined with a guffaw, “Can’t bury you, so the only option, really, is to disarticulate all your joints and dissolve you in hydrocloric acid.”</p> <p class="p2">“This is what passed for humour throughout my childhood,” Rowan commented drily, coming down the stairs behind Sammy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“If you ever wondered what’s wrong with me.”</p> <p class="p2">That was enough to announce their presence, and both Finley and Vikram stood up from where they were sitting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Vikram was in a trim suit jacket and slacks, with a black tie over an electric blue shirt.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Finley wore a tuxedo jacket, ruffled shirt, and a black knee-length skirt, pleated like a school girl’s.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Fading smiles creased both of their faces; they’d been laughing along with the Roth-Masters’ jokes about their own murders and dismemberments.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As they took in Sammy and Rowan (and Aggie and Zoey behind them), the looks of merriment were replaced by admiration.</p> <p class="p2">“You look amazing,” Vikram said, at the same time that Finley said, “Wow, Samantha, you look incredible.”</p> <p class="p2">They accepted the compliments and then the corsages that their dates had brought with them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As Finley slipped the collection of button red roses onto Sammy’s wrist, he spotted the boutonnière on their lapel, also composed of little red roses.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He touched it gently with his free hand and giggled, “We match.”</p> <p class="p2">“That’s the whole point,” said Vikram, and turned Rowan gently to display her corsage of blue orchids, held close to his boutonnière of the same.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The flowers matched his blue shirt and Rowan’s dress, which was a deep sapphire blue on top, fading gracefully to white at her feet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(Upstairs, she’d crowed: “I’m Elsa, bitch!” and made pew-pew noises while flinging her hands out at the walls.)</p> <p class="p2">“Oh, I didn’t know,” Sammy admitted, colouring slightly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’ve, uh.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Never done this before.”</p> <p class="p2">Rowan had her eye on the clock on the wall.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Okay, pictures!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The limo will be here in fifteen.”</p> <p class="p2">Vikram laughed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You rented a limo?”</p> <p class="p2">She scoffed in mock affront.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s Pride Prom, Vikram, of course I rented a limo.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You’ve gotta do these things properly.”</p> <hr /> <p class="p2">Pride Prom was weird and fun and weird and frustrating and weird.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was held at a hotel event center, in a mammoth box of a ballroom decorated with streamers and balloons.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The walls and floor would probably have been various shades of beige under the house lights, but pinwheeling rainbow floor lights splayed colour all over everything, instead.</p> <p class="p2">The center of the room was dominated by a wide dance floor before a stage from which a DJ shouted at the crowd in between tracks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Around the other three sides of the dance floor were tables and chairs; against the walls were circles and horseshoes of couches.</p> <p class="p2">The seats were half-full when they arrived.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The attendees ranged from teenagers to hipsters to doughy middle-aged folks to white-haired boomers; most of them looked a little dazed.</p> <p class="p2">They’d checked coats and bags and then found a little circle of couches around a coffee table festooned with crepe paper.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the center of the table was a fishbowl filled with tea lights and glass beads, topped with a plastic groom-and-groom cake topper.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It sat at an angle, and throughout the night they’d try to right the poor gentlemen, but they never stayed straight for long.</p> <p class="p2">Which was kind of appropriate, Sammy figured.</p> <p class="p2">The event was dry, for which Rowan had accomodated by stocking the limo generously.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They had pregamed hard and arrived at the venue on the far side of tipsy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But as their buzzes wore off, the energy seemed to curve the wrong way for an evening of partying.</p> <p class="p2">Once they were situated, Rowan and Zoey dashed across the room to the refreshments table and came back with arms full of punch in clear plastic cups.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Once these were passed out, Rowan raised hers high.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“A toast,” she crowed, “to queers getting to party together, as is our right and our solemn duty.”</p> <p class="p2">Everyone cheered merrily, at least at first.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With a chuckle, Vikram put out a hand and clarified: “As I am not a queer—sadly, I know; grown men have wept over it—I am happy to see you all get to celebrate in ways you might not have in high school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And so I am here in solidarity with you.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He raised his glass towards his date.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“As a favour to Rowan, to even out the numbers.”</p> <p class="p2">The rest of their little party was quiet for just a moment too long, and then lurched into lifting their glasses, cheering gamefully, and sipping at their punch.</p> <p class="p2">His date smiled sweetly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Vik, it doesn’t matter under what auspices you come tonight.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ll make sure you have a good time.”</p> <p class="p2">For once in his life, Sammy caught the innuendo—and he was pretty sure Vikram had not.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In any case, for the rest of the evening it seemed like Vikram’s presence had an asterisk over it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was here as a favour.</p> <p class="p2">But Sammy couldn’t pay too much attention to Rowan’s pursuit of Vikram and his apparent tone-deaf ignorance of what was happening.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He had his own awkwardness to deal with.</p> <p class="p2">It was Sammy and Finley’s first time out as a couple with friends.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Nestling into the crook of Finley’s arm, which Sammy had only ever experienced as comfortable and familiar, took on a distinctly performative cast.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>More than once he spotted one of the girls making moony eyes at him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He felt put on display, at least until he solved that problem by closing his eyes.</p> <p class="p2">“You two are such a cute couple,” Rowan gushed at him when all four of them decamped to the bathroom.</p> <p class="p2">“She speaks the truth,” Zoey chimed in.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“The way they look at you?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Amazing.”</p> <p class="p2">Agatha only shot him a smile, but even that felt a little patronizing.</p> <p class="p2">The best defense, he figured, was a strong offense.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Don’t think we’ve missed the two of you making eyes at each other,” he said, waving his fingers at Agatha and Zoey.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I think you’ve mentally undressed each other a dozen times each.”</p> <p class="p2">Agatha shrugged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s like a fun minigame.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At this point, I’m really good at it.”</p> <p class="p2">They passed by the refreshments table on the way back, returning to the table laden with glasses of punch, plates of chips and dip, and a few cups filled with candy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Finley laughed at their approach, and it didn’t take long to see why.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They and Vikram had had the same idea while the girls were in the bathroom, and had already provisioned their little coffee table.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Soon it was filled to overflowing, and they all tucked into the feast of junk food.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was surprisingly comfortable, even if it did feel a bit like a high school party.</p> <p class="p2">Which Sammy figured was also kind of appropriate: nothing said ‘high school’ like prom, after all.</p> <p class="p2">Sammy sat down next to Finley and was about to burrow into them, then thought better of it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He leaned back, tapping his collarbone invitingly, and Finley leaned into him with a contented sigh.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Like taking turns opening doors, he thought to himself.</p> <p class="p2">“I’m so glad you guys came down into the city for the weekend,” Rowan was telling Aggie and Zoey.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She was cuddled up against Vikram, looking exceedingly content.</p> <p class="p2">“I was all set to do our local Prides in Hartford and New Haven, compare and contrast, see whose was better, but this one”—and here she rolled her eyes over at Zoey—“insisted that nothing beats New York Pride.”</p> <p class="p2">“She’s right,” Rowan said with a diffident shrug.</p> <p class="p2">“Like you’ve ever done any other Pride in your life, bitch,” Agatha smirked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Anyway, it’s not like either of us actually have vacation days, but we can take a couple days off to come to the City.”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy had to adjust how he was sitting to take into account the weight of his enbyfriend pressed up against him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He forced a little giggle as he did so, jostling Finley but bending over to brush a kiss across their forehead while he had the opportunity.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He settled into seated position; Finley settled into him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It still wasn’t quite right, but Sammy would figure it out.</p> <p class="p2">“Did you fly or train?” asked Vikram.</p> <p class="p2">“Train,” Agatha answered.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It was actually kind of nice.”</p> <p class="p2">He nodded and then made a face.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m on a plane next week.”</p> <p class="p2">“Me, too,” said Rowan, bobbing her head, but with a calculating look in her eye.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not one that Vikram would be able to see, given his vantage.</p> <p class="p2">Instead he scoffed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Yeah, my flight is fifteen hours long.”</p> <p class="p2">“Mine’s eighteen,” she countered sourly.</p> <p class="p2">He craned his neck to look at her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Where are you going, girl?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My parents are roping me into the annual pilgrimage to fucking New Delhi.”</p> <p class="p2">“What?!” Rowan gasped, just a touch theatrically.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She planted her hand on his chest as she turned around to face him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“We’re going to New Delhi.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What the fuck!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That’s such a weird coincidence.”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy strongly suspected that it was not a coincidence at all.</p> <p class="p2">Vikram, by contrast, did not appear to suspect anything.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Holy shit, you’ll have to visit,” he insisted with a bright smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Come save me from all my cousins.”</p> <p class="p2">“I would love that,” she gushed, grinning from ear to ear.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Tate’s doing some research stuff and Daddy’s got colleagues he wants to see, so I’ll be at loose ends a bunch—”</p> <p class="p2">“I can show you the city,” he suggested.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“All the good food.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You can’t miss the food.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I bitch about the place, but it has some bright spots.”</p> <p class="p2">“I love this plan,” his cousin enthused, and turned around to lean up against her date again.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She smiled like the cat who ate the canary.</p> <p class="p2">Sammy looked from Rowan to Zoey, who caught his eye and rolled hers.</p> <p class="p2">They danced, they took silly photos at the selfie booth, they kept making trips back to the refreshments table to refill their inconveniently small plastic cups.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But by ten o’clock, their pregaming had dissipated completely and everyone was distressingly sober.</p> <p class="p2">“It feels strangely offputting to get less drunk as the night grows long,” Vikram observed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Remind me why there’s no alcohol at this thing?”</p> <p class="p2">Zoey rolled her eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Vik, there are teenagers present.”</p> <p class="p2">When he looked immediately at Sammy, Rowan laughed. “No.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hun.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Real teenagers, like fucking fourteen-year-olds.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They’re not going to give vodka tonics to fourteen-year-olds.”</p> <p class="p2">“Nobody wants to see that,” Agatha concurred with a solemn nod.</p> <p class="p2">“And there are other things to do than drink,” Rowan pointed out, grabbing Vikram’s hand and pulling him to his feet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Come dance!”</p> <p class="p2">With an arm under the small of Sammy’s back, Finley scooped him off the couch, onto his feet, and out onto the dance floor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sammy clutched at their shoulders, giggling. The music had been a truly unholy mish-mash of styles and eras as the DJ tried to cater to the vast breadth of ages among the attendees.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By now they were inured to it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Tainted Love” had just segued into “Pink Pony Club” without so much as a raised eyebrow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They just danced.</p> <p class="p2">An indeterminate number of songs later, the tempo had shifted downward and Sammy was curled up against Finley as they did little more than sway.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Who needed booze when you had exhaustion?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“This was a weird night,” he told them, stifling a yawn, “but I’m glad I got to spend it with you.”</p> <p class="p2">“I’m glad, too,” Finley replied, their chest vibrating against his cheek, and one corner of Sammy’s brain noted that that’s what he was learning not to do when he spoke.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He giggled at the thought.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And then Finley curled a finger under his chin to lift his face so he was looking up at them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And I don’t think I’ve said it explicitly yet, but you look beautiful tonight.”</p> <p class="p2">A slow smile spread over Sammy’s face.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You gonna take my picture, now?”</p> <p class="p2">Finley shook their head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“No,” their voice was soft, tender; Sammy wasn’t sure how he could hear it over the music.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I just wanted you to know.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You’re beautiful.”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy couldn’t bring himself to deflect or dodge, so instead he pressed his cheek against Finley’s lapel again.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Buried his nose in ruffles.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He didn’t want to deflect or dodge.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He wanted, just for a moment, to believe what Finley was saying.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Thank you,” he managed after a moment, unsure if his enbyfriend could even hear him.</p> <p class="p2">The DJ announced the last song of the night, and they spent more of it kissing than dancing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They were hardly the only couple on the dance floor so occupied.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then they returned to their group’s corner, where Vikram and Rowan were waiting, tapping on their phones.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Aggie and Zoey fell into the couches a moment later, only to stand up again as the party emptied out.</p> <p class="p2">The limo rental had only been for dropoff, so the six of them shuffled their way to the subway station along with at least a hundred other tired queers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There most of them parted; Finn offered to escort Sammy all the way to his dorm room, but doubling back would cost them almost an hour, and Sammy was too exhausted, anyway, to take advantage of the close proximity of Finn and his bed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He demurred, and Rowan promised to get her sleepy cousin home safe.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Vikram was taking a different train, anyway.</p> <p class="p2">Finley kissed him once more on the platform, and then Sammy dozed on Rowan’s shoulder as the train rattled homewards.</p> <hr /> <p class="p2">On Thursday morning, he awoke to a text from Rowan: <span class="s1">Rest up today for the big push!</span></p> <p class="p2">So Sammy rested.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And went to class.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And caught up on reading.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But as he traced a simple, tight triangle between dorm, class room, and dining hall, never once leaving campus, it felt like resting.</p> <p class="p2">He even got his voice exercises done, and went to bed at what felt like the decadent hour of ten p.m.</p> <hr /> <p class="p2">“Why is it called Bliss Days?” he asked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The four of them—Rowan, Agatha, Zoey, and Sammy—had just cleared the front desk of the venue and were crossing a rather sedate dining room towards the stairs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The thumping of bass along with shouts and cheers coming through the ceiling made encouraging promises about the party awaiting them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Nothing about that name says it’s an event for queer women.”</p> <p class="p2">“They used to call it Femme Fatale,” explained Zoey.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Which was a pretty clever name.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But, you know, not all women are femmes, I guess?”</p> <p class="p2">“Or they didn’t want ‘fatal’ to be part of their event name,” observed Agatha.</p> <p class="p2">“Regardless, we’re going to drink and dance and maybe-probably drool over all the eye candy on display,” Rowan declared, heading up the stairs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I dunno about you girls, but I kind of need this.”</p> <p class="p2">The second floor of the club was a maelstrom of flashing lights, upbeat music, and dancing bodies, nearly all of them women.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No windows, here, not that natural light would have had any chance against the flashing, actinic glare that permeated the room.</p> <p class="p2">Rowan’s hips started bouncing as she came up the final steps, and she reached backwards to grab Sammy and pull him into the fray.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The crowd parted for them easily, half of the dancers lost in their own groove and the other half plainly checking out the four new femmes who’d joined the party.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The dress code mirrored the crowd at Brooklyn Pride—rainbows and skin—just with, somehow, shorter skirts.</p> <p class="p2">Not that Sammy had much room to criticize: the girls had picked him up at his dorm room and decreed that his first outfit just wasn’t slutty enough, and had made him change.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’d protested that he was spoken for, that he didn’t have the least interest in getting picked up that night, but they insisted right back that it was the principle of the thing.</p> <p class="p2">Zoey and Agatha had simply recycled their prom wear from Wednesday, the hypocrites.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Have LBD, will travel,” Zoey had said with a shrug, and then they’d all tried to explain to Sammy what an LBD was, and he had to roll his eyes and insist that he already knew, he had a Little Black Dress in his closet, and why couldn’t he wear that?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But he’d been overruled.</p> <p class="p2">“They’re living out of suitcases; you’ve got access to your full closet, so you can go way skimpier,” Rowan admonished him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A woman of convictions, she herself was wearing a red triangle bikini top and daisy dukes so short the bottoms of the pockets poked out under the frayed bottom hems.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Think of all the lesbians, Sammy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They’re going to this event to see some skin; are you going to be the one to disappoint them?”</p> <p class="p2">So here he was in the shortest, flippiest little skirt he owned, plus fishnets, and an irridescent top that he’d only ever considered as something that would be supplemented with other layers—significantly longer layers—but was tonight making its solo debut, and doing a poor job of covering his bra.</p> <p class="p2">But as Sammy danced alongside Rowan, surrounded by skin and laughter, he found a certain sense of peace.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sure, he was nearly naked, but he was dancing, too, and dancing was about bodies, and the joy of how they moved and how they looked while moving.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So maybe wearing something that showed a little more of his body made some sense.</p> <p class="p2">It certainly made sense for the girls and the bodies around him, who were grinding and jiggling and swaying to the beat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rowan had been right: there was a lot of eye candy on display, set out to be drooled over.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But Sammy’s appreciation of individual parts—a shapely leg, a perfectly-rounded belly, the soft gradient of squished cleavage—faded away if he didn’t focus.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He found himself enjoying the whole picture, like one of those massive oil paintings in the Met, where the details added up to something greater than the parts.</p> <p class="p2">And if Sammy felt like he was contributing, that he and his body were part of that beautiful picture, then maybe he could let go a little.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Just dance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Just join in.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Just be one of the…</p> <p class="p2">“Drinks!” Rowan shouted in his ear, and started tugging him towards the stairs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Aggie and Zoey were leading the way, striking through the crowd so that he and Rowan could follow after.</p> <p class="p2">The next floor was full of leafy trees and fairy lights, a greenhouse that took up the whole third floor, with a retractable roof presently open to the stars.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Tables and couches curled around the trees, all of them mobbed with women and femmes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The bar—massive, rectangular, and polished until the wood shone—stood out from the sea of organic shapes and textures, bright backlit bottles beckoning with the promise of inebriation.</p> <p class="p2">Rowan and Zoey bellied up to the bar to order their drinks while Agatha and Sammy scouted for seating.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He almost despaired at the slim pickings until a knot of women all stood up right in front of him and beelined for the stairs down to the dance floor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He threw himself at the little circle of seats and then waved frantically for Agatha.</p> <p class="p2">“Well done, Sammy!” crowed Rowan when they regrouped.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I got doubles,” she explained, hands full of drinks, “because who knows how long it’ll take to get the next round.”</p> <p class="p2">They settled in, with both Agatha and Zoey groaning happily as they got off their feet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“We’ve been walking all over the City for two days straight,” Zoey sighed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I wish I had a pedometer, just to see how far we’ve gone.”</p> <p class="p2">“Wait, was there Pride stuff that Rowan didn’t drag me into?” Sammy laughed.</p> <p class="p2">“Not Pride events, just the quixotic farce that is looking for an affordable apartment in New York City,” Agatha groused.</p> <p class="p2">“Good luck with that,” Rowan put in.</p> <p class="p2">“I know I’ll probably be in the dorm with you,” Zoey sighed at her roommate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And Agatha can train in on weekends.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But it just… would have been nice to get a place together.”</p> <p class="p2">“Insert U-Haul joke here,” smirked Rowan.</p> <p class="p2">“We’ve been together six months next week,” Zoey retorted with faux hauteur.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“We do not qualify for U-Haul second-date punchlines, thank you very much.”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy blinked; things didn’t add up in his brain.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not the U-Haul lesbian thing; the other thing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Wait, why will you be training into the City?” he asked Agatha.</p> <p class="p2">“Because I graduated?” she laughed in response.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“They don’t let you live in the dorms if you’re not a student.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And I’m taking a year off before med school, because… I really need a year off before med school.”</p> <p class="p2">“Oh, I just… assumed you were all sophomores like Rowan,” he admitted, and shook his head as if to clear it of misconceptions.</p> <p class="p2">“I’m a year ahead of Rowan,” explained Zoey, “and Aggie was a year ahead of me, along with Finley.”</p> <p class="p2">“And Vik’s my year,” Rowan added, just a touch sourly.</p> <p class="p2">Nobody responded immediately; finally Zoey just said, “Yeah.”</p> <p class="p2">His cousin flopped her hands onto the plush arms of her chair, sloshing but not spilling her vodka tonic.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Seriously, should I just go back to dating girls?” she asked.</p> <p class="p2">“Yes,” Agatha answered without a second of hesitation.</p> <p class="p2">Zoey was a little more diplomatic.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Or maybe just… not fixate on the one boy who… doesn’t seem interested.”</p> <p class="p2">“He’s interested,” Rowan maintained truculently, and slurped the last of her drink out from the ice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’ve sat on his lap enough to know: there is—ahem—<i>pointed</i> interest, there.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’s just… being difficult.”</p> <p class="p2">“Honey, you’re hot,” her roommate tried to explain, “and I’m sure you… inspire a reaction in him, especially with the way you flirt, but there’s… other aspects to consider when dating.”</p> <p class="p2">Rowan scowled into her empty glass and stood up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m getting another.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Anybody else?”</p> <p class="p2">The other girls had barely put a dent in theirs; Sammy reluctantly asked for a second—his first wasn’t even half gone—just so his cousin wouldn’t feel awkward.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She stormed off, back to the bar.</p> <p class="p2">“What is with her and Vikram?” he asked Zoey once Rowan was out of earshot.</p> <p class="p2">“He told her no,” the girl replied, shrugged, and sank into her chair.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Which only makes her want it more.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Just to show him.”</p> <p class="p2">“If he wanted to be rid of her, all he’d need to do is take her on one medicore date,” Agatha sighed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Then she’d lose interest.”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy looked back to where his cousin had gone, caught one glimpse of her shoulderblade, waiting by the bar, and turned back to the girls.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“So like… why doesn’t he?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I mean.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He struggled to put together the question he actually wanted to ask.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“She’s told me that he said he can’t date a white girl, but also that he has dated white girls before.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And he likes her, right?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’s all jazzed to see her in India.”</p> <p class="p2">Zoey rolled her eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Don’t even get me started on that nonsense.”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy nodded and waved his hands sideways, as if he could brush the largest democracy in the world back out of the conversation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Yeah, that’s… that’s a whole nother thing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He seems to like her company, he’s attracted to her… what other, uh, aspects is he considering that’s holding him back?”</p> <p class="p2">“What do you think?” Agatha all but spat, and focused on her drink.</p> <p class="p2">Zoey saw that he wasn’t jumping to the conclusion that she and her girlfriend found obvious, and she gave him a soft, almost apologetic smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Cause she’s trans, honey.”</p> <p class="p2">“Really?” he asked incredulously.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Vikram?”</p> <p class="p2">She shrugged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“He’s a decent guy—as guys go—but for some guys, that’s just a non-starter.”</p> <p class="p2">“You can bet he’s under pressure from his parents to produce grandchildren,” Agatha added sourly, “and that’s not gonna happen with Rowan.”</p> <p class="p2">But he kissed me, Sammy thought but did not say.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Because so had Agatha and Zoey, that same night, and it had meant nothing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And because if Vikram had kissed Sammy as a lark, but wouldn’t date Rowan because she was trans… the memory of that kiss curdled in Sammy’s mind.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That kiss, performed right in front of his cousin, had meant less than nothing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It had been something cynical, something for show, something to push Rowan away.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To hurt her, just a little, and get her to back off.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He felt a little sick.</p> <p class="p2">But then Rowan was back with drinks, and he polished off his first so that he could accept the next one, and the girls talked about something else for a while.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They abandoned their lucky seats to go downstairs and dance some more, and later when they came back up for more drinks, they had to sip while standing around and fending off propositions from hopeful single lesbians.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then they went dancing some more, everything blurring together into a wash of lights and beats and bodies again.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They stumbled home in the early hours, when the City was as quiet as it ever got.</p> <p class="p2">Rowan didn’t mention Vikram again for the rest of the night.</p> <hr /> <p class="p2">“Okay, so what is the difference between a March and a Parade?” asked Sammy as they plodded along Fifth Avenue.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The four of them had reconvened Saturday afternoon, first at a barbeque place to fuel up on tacos and beer, and then across the street in Bryant Park, for the start of the Dyke March.</p> <p class="p2">Now they were walking down the middle of the street with a whole bunch of lesbians.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There were so many, in fact, that they stopped traffic; teams of volunteer marshalls linked arms at every cross street to hold back the cars so everybody else could pass by.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A lot of the marchers were waving signs or carrying banners, which bore slogans from the straightforward—“My Body My Choice”—to the arcane: “Even When Her Shackles Are Different Than Mine.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sammy wasn’t complaining, exactly, but being in a throng of lesbians had been more fun the night before, when there was dancing involved.</p> <p class="p2">“A march advocates for change,” explained Zoey.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s an expression of how things are not okay, that we are organized to take action, and those in power ought to take notice.”</p> <p class="p2">“Whereas a parade,” put in Rowan, “is a reminder to ourselves and everybody else, that—”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She inflated her lungs and then shouted across the assembled heads: “WE OWN THESE STREETS!”</p> <p class="p2">A moment later a dozen voices echoed back, “WE OWN THESE STREETS!”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rowan repeated the phrase again, and this time even more voices took up the chant.</p> <p class="p2">She kept it up long enough until it had a life of its own, and she didn’t need to cheerlead.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She turned to Sammy with a grin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“New York isn’t New York without us.”</p> <p class="p2">“Yeah, but…” Sammy protested weakly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“This is a march, not a parade, so… chanting that we own the streets seems… contrary to your point?”</p> <p class="p2">But Rowan shrugged off his confusion.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“There’s overlap.”</p> <p class="p2">“The Parade has a city permit,” Agatha pointed out laconically.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Dyke March does not.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is, technically, an act of civil disobedience.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Walking in the Parade is participating in an event condoned by the government.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She waggled her hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Kind of a different vibe.”</p> <p class="p2">Different vibe or no, it was a lot of walking: more than thirty blocks of slow steps.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The only entertainment was spotting clever new signs and occasionally shouting call-and-response chants.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sammy was… less than enamoured of this particular event.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And perhaps part of that was just simple exhaustion on his part: it had been a long week.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Now he was walking two miles in the thick summer air, for obscure political reasons.</p> <p class="p2">Thinking about politics prompted Sammy to ask Rowan, “Why aren’t your dads in the march?”</p> <p class="p2">“Because it’s only open to dykes,” she answered easily enough.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Self-identified, of course.”</p> <p class="p2">Ah.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So this was another thing that Sammy probably shouldn’t be involved with that Rowan had just swept him into.</p> <p class="p2">He looked around him, at all the dykes shouting and chanting and smiling at each other.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Everyone cared so much.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You could see it in their faces; you could hear it in their voices.</p> <p class="p2">Thanks to Gideon’s reading list, Sammy had a tenuous grasp of activism—collective action, solidarity, exposing and addressing inequalities and oppression—but until now, his understanding had been entirely theoretical.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But looking up and down the thronged street, he was surprised to see all those parts in evidence right in front of him.</p> <p class="p2">He could see how all these dykes had gathered, agreed that many things in the world had gone wrong, and so they stood up and made a scene.</p> <p class="p2">Suddenly, it was amazing to witness.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There were so many people in this march, so many people who’d taken time out of their lives, who’d come out to flout the laws and stall the traffic and shout to the rooftops until they were heard.</p> <p class="p2">He wished he could be a part of it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But here he was, merely walking while they marched.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Stealing a little of that glory.</p> <p class="p2">Because that’s all he was doing: pretending to be something he wasn’t so he could get into a good school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><i>Take what you can get, babe</i>, except Gideon’s advice had been predicated on a marginalized identity that Sammy had no right to claim.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Selfish.</p> <p class="p2">Selfish, and now witness to such community, such solidarity, such vision, that it shamed him to his core.</p> <p class="p2">It was as if the circumstances which had wrapped him up in this ridiculous ruse had also brought him closer to all this, dangled him here where he could witness this marvelous, beautiful, powerful community.</p> <p class="p2">A community to which he did not belong.</p> <p class="p2">A community that he was mocking and denigrating just by being here.</p> <p class="p2">A community to which he was an outsider at best and an imposter at worst.</p> <p class="p2">The pace of the march wavered; squeals and shouts sounded from up ahead.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sammy craned his neck to see what the commotion might be.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the horizon were trees and a plume of water arcing up against the afternoon sky.</p> <p class="p2">“You can’t call this the best part of the march,” Rowan appeared at his elbow to confide, “but this is the best part of the march.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And without any further explanation, she peeled off her shirt.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No bra underneath.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His cousin ran giggling under the great stone arch that served as the Fifth Avenue entrance to Washington Square Park.</p> <p class="p2">Sammy followed uncertainly, his eyes widening to saucers as the scene before him came into view.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sunk into the center of the park’s plaza and surrounded by thick stone steps was a massive fountain.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Water shot six stories into the air before falling down into a broad, shallow pool.</p> <p class="p2">The pool was full of dykes, in various states of undress, all sopping wet.</p> <p class="p2">Zoey went streaking past him a moment later, and then Agatha came up to stand beside him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She was still clothed, and holding Zoey’s shirt and shorts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She gave Sammy and his astonishment a short smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“This is how the Dyke March always ends,” she told him.</p> <p class="p2">“You’re not… joining?”</p> <p class="p2">Agatha shook her head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I don’t get naked for everybody.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No judgement, it’s just not my style.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She paused a beat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’d be happy to hold your clothes for you, if you like.”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy looked down into what was becoming a party in the fountain.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>People of all shapes and sizes waded and splashed, laughing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Almost all were topless; a smattering were completely nude.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A few couples kissed under the spray.</p> <p class="p2">Sammy did a double take to confirm that, yes, one of the naked dykes was, well, trans and hadn’t had bottom surgery.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her little girldick flopped around merrily as she danced in the fountain.</p> <p class="p2">“You not going in?” asked Agatha, voice neutral.</p> <p class="p2">Sammy shook his head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He didn’t belong in there.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He might have marched with the dykes today, he might have partied and danced with them last night, but he shouldn’t have.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He didn’t understand then, but he understood now: he’d been trespassing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’d taken the wonderful world that they’d painstakingly created and defended, and he’d smeared himself all over it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not that he could say any of that to Aggie.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So instead he joked: “I think my tits would fall off.”</p> <p class="p2">Agatha nodded.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“That would be awkward.”</p> <p class="p2">So they stood and watched as a few hundred dykes splashed and laughed and danced in the water, insisting on being seen in all their glory.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sammy’s heart thumped in his chest with longing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Eventually he turned away, and told Aggie he’d catch the subway home on his own.</p> <hr /> <p class="p2">“Rowan, I’m not sure how much Pride I’ve got left in me,” he tried telling her the next day. They were coming up out of the subway station, meeting Aggie and Zoey and Finley for the parade.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“After yesterday?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And the night before?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You didn’t tell me Pride is an endurance trial.”</p> <p class="p2">She turned and walked backwards so she could grin at him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“The best endurance trial ever, though.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You’ve had fun, yeah?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A flicker of uncertainty squeezed the corners of her eyes.</p> <p class="p2">“I have,” he nodded, and only after answering actually thought about it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He wasn’t lying, at least not in part.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There’d been a lot that he had enjoyed, even if there’d been some rocky bits, too.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At least the parade today was actually for queers like him, and he wouldn’t end up frustrated at himself for infiltrating events he had no business at.</p> <p class="p2">He’d worn a rainbow tie-dye crop top that he’d picked up at Brooklyn Pride, because the rainbow thing was for all queers, and he qualified for that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’d also managed to find yellow, pink, and blue bangles for his wrists, so he had a little pan bling, too.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was wearing entirely too many different colours (remembering Rowan’s bathroom admonishment about picking a colour and sticking with it had almost prompted him to ditch the whole outfit), but he was resolved not to care.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was here to have fun and be with his people.</p> <p class="p2">“So where are we sitting?” he asked Rowan’s back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In Brooklyn, she’d insisted they go claim good seats more than an hour before the parade even started.</p> <p class="p2">“Oh, we’re not sitting,” she laughed back at him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She grabbed his hand and pulled him up the street.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Fifth Avenue was closed, this time with police barricades, but each street leading east and west was crowded with masses of people, trucks covered in glittery tinsel, and actual parade floats.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was to the one of the floats that she directed him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“We’re riding in style!”</p> <p class="p2">The float was essentially a very flamboyant flatbed trailer: all rainbow glitter shimmering in the morning light.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A railing snaked around the outside edge, defining a little walkway around the float’s centerpiece: a massive papier mâché recreation of The Thinker.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The real sculpture sat outside Philosophy Hall back on campus; this one had been embellished with a thought bubble above his head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It read: “I Think, Therefore Gay.”</p> <p class="p2">Columbia’s name and logo were emblazoned across the sides of the trailer, along with the names and logos of CQA and GendeRev.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rowan pulled Sammy over to the short ladder at the back corner of the flatbed, all but hidden under the reflective tassles of tinsel.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m on the float?” he asked needlessly, even as he climbed aboard.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Is that even allowed?”</p> <p class="p2">Rowan pulled herself up after him and shrugged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You’re a Columbia student, so sure, why not?”</p> <p class="p2">“Yeah, but not… really.”</p> <p class="p2">“You take classes at Columbia, that makes you a Columbia student,” she told him, rolling her eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And besides, it’s stupid hard getting volunteers to ride this thing outside of the school year.”</p> <p class="p2">“They even let me on, and I don’t even go there anymore,” said Finley, coming around the walkway from behind The Gay Thinker.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Smiling wide, they slid their arms around Sammy’s waist; he leaned in eagerly for a good morning kiss.</p> <p class="p2">“You work there,” Rowan pointed out with good-natured exasperation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“This is as much about Columbia as a queer-friendly workplace as about Columbia as a queer-friendly school.”</p> <p class="p2">Finley had settled their arm onto Sammy’s far hip.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They snorted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Queer friendly because we drag them there, kicking and screaming every time.”</p> <p class="p2">“Exactly.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rowan returned with a large cardboard box, and shoved it into Finley’s belly, under his free hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And now we celebrate our victories on a sparkly parade float in front of millions of people.”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy reached into the box.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Inside sloshed little rainbow foil squares, each one bearing the school’s logo.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He pulled one out and squinted at it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“We’re celebrating with condoms?”</p> <p class="p2">“Damn straight,” Rowan nodded.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Safer sex for everybody!”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She bustled away to talk to some of the other volunteers, having an earnest conversation about something-or-other and directing them all to space out the little cardboard boxes all around the base of the central statue.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rainbow condoms within reach no matter where you were on the float.</p> <p class="p2">“We’re going to throw these out to the people watching the parade,” Finley tried to explain to Sammy.</p> <p class="p2">“Oh, I assumed as much,” he nodded.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Some floats did that at Brooklyn Pride last weekend.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I thought about making a little collection out of the ones I caught.”</p> <p class="p2">Finley passed him one with a grin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Well here, add to your collection.”</p> <p class="p2">Not having pockets, Sammy took the foil packet and slipped it into his bra.</p> <p class="p2">“Oh my god, could you two be any more disgustingly adorable?” asked Zoey as she pulled herself up the ladder behind them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When Sammy detached from Finley self-consciously, she waved her hands.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“No no, you were doing a good job.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Be disgustingly, publicly adorable.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s Pride!”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy chuckled at that and looked sidelong at his enbyfriend.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They were wearing the sparkly green dress they’d worn at the club when Sammy had first met them, and makeup even bolder than the look they’d been sporting that night.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was probably their most gender-bendy outfit, and also had the benefit of being skimpy and therefore cool for the hot summer day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Standing beside Sammy, who was decked out in rainbows and all his obvious transness, they were very clearly a queer couple.</p> <p class="p2">And now they’d be on a float in front of—Rowan had said—millions of people.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Held up as… what, exemplars of queer life on Columbia’s campus?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So many people, so many pairs of eyes, all of them seeing him… like this?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Was he really comfortable with that?</p> <p class="p2">Sammy was surprised to realize he was.</p> <p class="p2">It was Pride, after all.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The streets were lined with queers and allies, and they’d all be smiling and waving and cheering.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He had nothing to worry about.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a big, queer love fest, and they were all there to cheer each other on.</p> <p class="p2">Agatha had climbed aboard after Zoey and was now poking at one of the cardboard boxes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Ah, the good ol’ rainbow condoms, eh?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Good to see we’re continuing our tradition of erasing cis lesbians dating cis lesbians.”</p> <p class="p2">Rowan came around the corner of the float with another box, this one labelled: Open In Case of Agatha Bitching.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She thrust it into her friend’s hands and then patted her cheek.</p> <p class="p2">Agatha pried open the box.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Ooo, rainbow dental dams!”</p> <hr /> <p class="p2">They waited for nearly an hour before it was their float’s turn to rumble to life and creep onto the parade route.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And then they spent the better part of three hours smiling and waving and throwing condoms and dental dams into the crowd.</p> <p class="p2">There was a sound system buried underneath The Gay Thinker, so they blasted queer music as they went, singing along when they knew the words, shaking their hips when they didn’t.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sometimes the crowd joined in, which seemed a little like magic.</p> <p class="p2">And sure, it got tiring, and towards the end Sammy’s smile and wave were both getting a little strained, but how could he stop?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These were his people, who were happy to see him, and he was happy to see them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There were families and little kids, and he wanted to show them, beam into their little brains, that it was okay to be who you were, that being queer was totally normal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Teenagers, too, with fierce grins and who may or may not be here with their parents or their knowledge, taking a chance to see what was possible in this big wide world.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So he waved, and smiled, and threw rainbowed prophylactics until the boxes were empty.</p> <p class="p2">The float pulled past the end of the parade route and onto a side street, rumbling to a stop next to the curb.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They disembarked sloppily, bending and flexing their legs after having stood and braced on a moving float for hours on end.</p> <p class="p2">Rowan’s fellow organizers had to push her off the float, reminding her that she’d signed up for setup, not teardown, and she was done for the day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She turned to her friends with a sheepish smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Something something avoid burnout, you stupid bitch,” she paraphrased, and then clapped her hands.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And the next step of that is beer, right?”</p> <p class="p2">PrideFest was only a few blocks away, the same kind of square-canopies-lining-the-street sort of affair as Brooklyn Pride had been, only bigger and louder.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A beer garden had been set up in an adjacent park; after filing past the bored-looking attendant checking IDs, they bought overpriced beer and settled into a spot of grassy shade.</p> <p class="p2">Rowan pointed at Sammy around her tall plastic cup.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“See what I meant about last weekend being baby Pride?”</p> <p class="p2">“Yeah, this is huge,” he agreed, and leaned sideways, up against Finley’s shoulder.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Seems too big to see it all.”</p> <p class="p2">“Oh, absolutely,” his enbyfriend laughed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Especially after the parade.”</p> <p class="p2">But Rowan was intent on at least giving it a good try.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They roved up and down the streets, poking their heads into every stall they passed, picking up pamphlets for weird community organizations, colourful souvenier condoms for Sammy’s new collection, even fridge magnets from the City explaining how to properly recycle your motor oil (why did they even have a booth?).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Aggie and Zoey bailed after they completed the first street, citing their tired feet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rowan, Sammy, and Finley pressed on.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It felt like half the stalls they visited they’d already seen at Brooklyn Pride, or maybe they were all just blurring together.</p> <p class="p2">“Oh my god!” shouted Rowan, and went squealing towards the next stall, a double-wide pavillion filled to bursting with sequins and technicolour wigs and sex toys.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Transformations Boutique had made an appearance at Pride, and staffing the booth was not just Gloria but also Lucille herself, in the flesh.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“The Riviera’s too hot this time of year,” she confided to Rowan after introductions had been made.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And besides, I couldn’t miss Pride.”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy’s cousin dove into chatting with Lucille, catching up what sounded like years of backlogged life stories.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He chimed in a few times, but it quickly became clear that the conversation was between the two ladies, with Finley listening in.</p> <p class="p2">Finally he took a step back, made sure nobody had noticed his quiet withdrawl, and stalked across the booth to the register counter and Gloria.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Along the way he scooped a cardboard box off the display table and quietly set it down next to the register.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Can I get this, please?” he asked the tattooed clerk.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“In a, um, in a bag?”</p> <p class="p2">The sales girl smirked, first bagging the box before ringing it up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Nothing to be ashamed of, Samantha.”</p> <p class="p2">“Not ashamed,” he told her, and managed a smile that was equal parts genuine and embarrassed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s just a surprise.”</p> <p class="p2">Gloria’s eyes darted from Sammy to Finley, across the stall.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“They’re cute.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hope you two have fun.”</p> <p class="p2">He handed over money; she gave him his change and a receipt.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Not returnable if it’s opened, obviously,” she advised him.</p> <p class="p2">“Jeez, I hope not,” he laughed, and then turned around to walk right into Rowan, done chatting with Lucille.</p> <p class="p2">She made a show of trying to look down into his bag.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Whatcha got there, Sammy?”</p> <p class="p2">“You don’t want to know what this is,” he told her, and couldn’t help giggling.</p> <p class="p2">She lifted one eyebrow.</p> <p class="p2">“It’s just more rainbow shit,” he admitted, or half-admitted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was, indeed, rainbow-coloured.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She slitted her eyes theatrically and then turned away.</p> <p class="p2">The bag burned in his hand, alternately weighty or as light as air.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He couldn’t believe that he’d bought the thing, and he was also so immensely relieved that he had.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He simply didn’t have time to go across town to the actual Transformations Boutique, and he didn’t know the first thing about ordering this sort of thing online.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He tried not to think about it, but his attention kept wandering back to the bag and its contents.</p> <p class="p2">It was only when he volunteered to stand in line for lemonade while both Finley and Rowan ran off to the restroom that he could peek again at his purchase.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He had to be careful, though, lest the people ahead and behind him in line saw what he had.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not that they were paying much attention; ahead, a gaggle of teens were laughing with their friends, and behind him two bare-chested men were passing the time making out.</p> <p class="p2">Sammy tipped the bag so he could peer down at the box inside.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yep.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’d actually bought it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The top edge was labelled Training Dildo with Flared Base.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The name, and the product itself, were indeed rainbow coloured.</p> <p class="p2">It was the rainbow part that caught up with him, and not the thing-to-stick-in-your-butt part.</p> <p class="p2">Knowing that he’d bought yet another rainbow pride thing and still hadn’t picked up some proper trans bling seemed to incense Rowan.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She started pointing out every iteration of baby blue and pink (sometimes white got in there, but not often) that she spotted, waggling her eyebrows in an unintentional caricature of a used car salesman.</p> <p class="p2">Trans pride hoodie.</p> <p class="p2">Trans pride incense holder.</p> <p class="p2">Trans pride skirt.</p> <p class="p2">“Programmer socks” with bands of the three colours all up and down their length, without any explanation what they had to do with programmers.</p> <p class="p2">A trans pride flag made out of coloured glass to hang in his window.</p> <p class="p2">A trans pride flag sticker to go on his laptop.</p> <p class="p2">By the time Rowan held up the seventh trans pride coloured item for Sammy’s consideration—this time it was a pink-blue-and-white knit beanie with a cartoon animal patch on the front—her desperation was starting to show.</p> <p class="p2">“Don’t you think I’m a little old for Pokémon?” he tried to laugh it off.</p> <p class="p2">“Sylveon is eternal,” she insisted, and then looked down at the hat with a slight smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Honestly, I might… nah.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And then it went back on the hat rack, but the conversation topic itself was not so easily discarded.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She followed him out of the booth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Really, Sammy, I don’t get it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Do you just not like the baby colours?”</p> <p class="p2">“It’s not that,” he hedged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Finley was in the next booth, talking animatedly with the vendor about windchimes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Maybe he could slide into that conversation to get out of this one.</p> <p class="p2">“It’s because you’re embarrassed,” his cousin said, half-accusingly, half-despondent, and stopped dead in the middle of the flow of people.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You don’t want to wear the colours, you don’t want to… advertise that you’re trans.”</p> <p class="p2">He turned around, already shaking his head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“No, it’s not that at all.”</p> <p class="p2">“It’s not something to be ashamed of, Sammy,” she told him, far more earnestly and desperately than he was comfortable with her acting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Even if some people don’t understand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Can’t understand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s wonderful and amazing and… and it’s Pride, Sammy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Samantha.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This week of all weeks, we get to be proud of who we are.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Fuck, did she have tears in her eyes?</p> <p class="p2">He wrapped her up in a hug.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Rowan, I am proud, I am so proud,” he said, his lips to her ear.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You have no idea.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This week has been… it’s been magical.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He pulled back so he could look her in the face.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A few tears had fallen down her cheeks during the hug.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“My first Pride, Ro, and it’s been amazing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And you made it amazing.”</p> <p class="p2">“Really?”</p> <p class="p2">He nodded his head so hard it felt like it might fall off.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Really.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Really-really.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He hazarded a weak smile and considered just going back and buying the damn Sylveon beanie.</p> <p class="p2">As if he wasn’t wearing enough pride bling already.</p> <p class="p2">Maybe that was an angle that could work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He nodded Rowan’s attention down to his rainbow crop top, gestured with his pan pride bangles.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“But Ro, it’s my first Pride,” he told her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’ve never been with so many of my people before.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our people.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s amazing, and it’s a lot, and… I just want to kind of savour it?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Let me just celebrate being queer this year, okay?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Next Pride I can focus on being trans.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He immediately felt a little shitty about the disingenuity—next Pride he’d be detransitioned, and he was pretty sure there wasn’t a detransition pride flag—but pushed the thought away.</p> <p class="p2">She considered him for a long moment and then heaved a sigh.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I mean, I guess, even if it means you’re wearing fucking rainbows.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She giggled, then wrapped her arms around him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m glad you’re having a good Pride, Sammy.”</p> <p class="p2">And at least for a little while, Sammy thought he’d fixed things.</p> <hr /> <p class="p2">Five hours later, Rowan was slumped across the table and also melting onto Sammy, cheek pressed against the tabletop as she explained to him, slurring: “It’s no use, Sammy, it’s stupid, I’m stupid, none of this is gonna work but also I can’t stop.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ve never been able to stop, Sammy, not with anything, and I’m always this runaway train car which is also on fire.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You know?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You know.”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy did know, or at least he knew that his cousin had started drinking at PrideFest and then indeed had not seemed able to stop.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Finley had said goodnight and headed home before she’d got sloppy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Now it was well past midnight and the two of them were in their third club of the night.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rowan had just drained her last cocktail before deciding to take a burbling nap on the table.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Maybe we should go home?” he suggested.</p> <p class="p2">She glared at him as if he had suggested admitting defeat, inflated her lungs, and pushed herself up to sitting straight.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“No.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No, I just need to go to the bathroom.”</p> <p class="p2">“That’s not going to—”</p> <p class="p2">Rowan flailed her hand at him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Just help me to the bathroom, dammit.”</p> <p class="p2">If Rowan never could stop, Sammy never could tell her no.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So he pulled her up to standing and then braced his shoulder under her armpit.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was not particularly steady nor sober, himself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A moment later he remembered to turn around and collect their purses and bags of pride bling, and then they lurched off to the bathrooms.</p> <p class="p2">Pressed up against his cousin, Sammy could feel her diaphrahm lurch, and worried that she’d puke before they even got there.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She held it down valiantly all the way to the door to the ladies’, which they kicked open only to find a five-person line waiting for a stall.</p> <p class="p2">The woman at the head of the line took one look at them and beckoned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Oh wow, sweetie, come with me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ve got you.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And she lifted Rowan off of Sammy’s shoulder and conducted her directly into the next open stall.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A moment later the sound of Rowan retching echoed through the room.</p> <p class="p2">Sammy looked worriedly back at the rest of the line, but nobody seemed upset about Rowan skipping to the front.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If anything, they looked concerned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He supposed waiting another minute or two was better than somebody puking in the middle of the floor in here.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He crossed the room to park his butt against the baby changing station.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was nice and stable, and didn’t require him to do difficult things like stand without drifting to the side.</p> <p class="p2">“That your friend?” asked a plump redheaded girl at the adjacent sink.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her eyes went to the not-quite-closed stall door and back to Sammy, her pupils moving in the laconic slide of the thoroughly inebriated.</p> <p class="p2">He nodded, slowly and carefully.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“My cousin.”</p> <p class="p2">“Is she alright?”</p> <p class="p2">He shook his head, also slowly and carefully.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I don’t think so.”</p> <p class="p2">The redhead reached over to pat his elbow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s okay, we’ll fix her up.”</p> <p class="p2">A few minutes later, Rowan staggered back out of the stall and to the sink, looking disconsolably at her reflection.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m so ugly,” she pouted.</p> <p class="p2">Sammy’s stomach lurched in surprise and sudden fear.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rowan calling herself ugly?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What was happening?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The very foundations of his world were trembling.</p> <p class="p2">The redhead shushed her, digging into her purse.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Oh hush, your mascara’s running, that’s all.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She produced a little crinkly packet of makeup wipes, pulled out the last one, and went to work on Rowan’s cheeks.</p> <p class="p2">“That’s why nothing works, because I’m hideous, look at me.” Rowan told the room, gesturing at her reflection.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Why would he even want this?”</p> <p class="p2">“If he doesn’t, he’s blind or stupid,” answered the woman who had helped Rowan into her stall.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She crossed the room to share a sink with another woman, quickly washing her hands and fluffing her curly brown hair.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Which: par for the course.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You should try playing for the other team sometime.”</p> <p class="p2">“Girls are just fucked up in different ways,” Rowan slurred, watching her reflection lose its raccoon face.</p> <p class="p2">“True that,” agreed the girl cleaning her up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You got a lipstick, honey?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Cause this is smeared real good and it’d be best if we just started over.”</p> <p class="p2">“Oh, that’s in… here,” Sammy muttered, digging into Rowan’s purse.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He found the blocky lipstick inside and passed it over.</p> <p class="p2">The brunette leaned towards the mirror to make eye contact with Rowan.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“If he doesn’t appreciate all this,” she said, gesturing up and down Rowan’s reflection, “that’s a him problem, honey, not a you problem.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She jabbed her pointer finger at Rowan though the mirror.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You’re gorgeous.”</p> <p class="p2">Rowan’s shoulders slumped.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“No I’m not.”</p> <p class="p2">“Do you know how hard I would be hitting on you right now if you weren’t completely wasted?” the woman laughed, sloppily, and Sammy realized that she was just as drunk as everyone else here, just better at hiding it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’d scoop you up and take you home under my elbow.”</p> <p class="p2">“But <i>he</i> won’t,” Rowan insisted, sniffling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“No matter how much he wants to. I know he wants to.”</p> <p class="p2">“That doesn’t mean he knows how much he wants to.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The redhead had shifted to sit on the counter, facing Rowan, as she deftly worked the twisted-up end of the wipe around the girl’s eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dribbles of mascara and stray smudges of eyeliner were carefully erased, leaving behind a surprisingly intact wing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Always remember: boys are dense and slow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It takes them forever to see the pretty girl standing right in front of them.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She leaned left so Rowan was facing herself in the mirror.</p> <p class="p2">Rowan’s lip wobbled as she took in her amended reflection, like she was fighting to actually look at herself, actually see what she looked like, and not what her brain told her she looked like.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Finally, she said, “I am pretty cute, huh?”</p> <p class="p2">“Yes you are,” smiled the redhead, and held her arms out, weaving slightly on top of the counter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Do you hug?”</p> <p class="p2">Rowan collapsed forward into the girl.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I love hugs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Specially with pretty girls,” she sighed, squeezing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The redhead squeezed back, and the two of them just kind of tipped back and forth for a little while—long enough that Sammy looked away.</p> <p class="p2">The brunette was frowning at her own reflection.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I should have brought clips,” she sighed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m gonna chop this all back tomorrow, it’s ridiculous.”</p> <p class="p2">“I have clips,” Sammy heard himself say, and pulled out of his purse a trio of purple ones, clipped onto each other in a little bundle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He held them forward.</p> <p class="p2">“You sure?” the brunette asked with a trace of doubt.</p> <p class="p2">He shrugged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“They came in a pack of other colours I actually wanted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These are just my emergency backup clips.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Take em.”</p> <p class="p2">She did, and slid them into her hair, squinting at her reflection.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I dunno if these are big enough for all this,” she said doubtfully.</p> <p class="p2">“No, you’ve just got to—” Sammy started, and then pushed himself forward, reaching.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“May I?”</p> <p class="p2">The brunette nodded, cocking her head towards Sammy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He made quick work of pinning back her hair into something that looked more like a style and less like a tangled mess.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She looked back into the mirror, eyes popping wide.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Oh wow, that’s amazing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Those little clips can hold, like, a lot.”</p> <p class="p2">“I wear them most every day,” he explained.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’ve learned some tricks.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He smiled into the mirror at her; she smiled back.</p> <p class="p2">“Oh gosh, you are not too fat,” Rowan was half-whispering at the redheaded girl.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You are hot as hell, girl.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Seriously.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You should go for it.”</p> <p class="p2">His cousin stepped back from the hug that had apparently gone on the whole time he’d been fixing the other woman’s hair.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She dropped a hand on Sammy’s shoulder and gave him a bleary smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You need anything, Samantha?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Touch up?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Relationship advice?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hair care?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His cousin’s spine was straight again, her face immaculate and poised.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She’d been completely put back together.</p> <p class="p2">“Um.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m good,” he answered, and giggled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He looked around the cramped little bathroom.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At the other end of the line of sinks, two tipsy girls were fixing each other’s eyeliner and trading fierce compliments.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Over by the door, three people waiting for stalls were engaged in a fervent if slightly slurred conversation about how one of them—it wasn’t clear who—should dump their bigotted boyfriend.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He looked back to Rowan.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“But if I ever need any of that, I know where to get it.”</p> <p class="p2">“Thank the goddess for drunk girls in the club bathroom,” Rowan crowed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With a final wave to the brunette and redhead, Rowan hooked her elbow into Sammy’s and guided them toward the door.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Just at the threshold, though, she spun them both around to look back.</p> <p class="p2">The redhead was still seated on the counter, but she’d drawn the brunette over to stand before her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her head tilted back, her eyes flashed, and her full lips curved into a victorious smile; the brunette leaned forward and they kissed.</p> <p class="p2">“Oh wow,” Sammy cooed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Good for them.”</p> <p class="p2">Rowan sighed contentedly, and whirled the two of them around again.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As the bathroom door closed behind them, she giggled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“God, I love being a girl.”</p> <p class="p2">“Me, too,” Sammy giggled, stumbling merrily along the dimly-lit hall.</p> <p class="p2">It wasn’t until they were on the subway home that Sammy’s sluggish and still half-drunk brain caught up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While Rowan rested her head against his shoulder and talked about nothing whatsoever, Sammy grew quiet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His heart started hammering in his chest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His vision blurred, and it wasn’t the alcohol.</p> <p class="p2">He’d agreed with Rowan without thinking, but also without lying and without a trace of deception.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’d just blurted it out, in drunken honesty.</p> <p class="p2">Sammy loved being a girl.</p> <p class="p2">Fuck.</p> <p> </p> <div class="wi_authornotes"> <div> <div class="p-avatar-wrap"><a class="avatar has-link" href="https://scribblehub.com/profile/149271/miriamrobern/"><img id="acc_ava_change profile" alt="" src="https://cdn.scribblehub.com/avatar/s/37/ava_149271_1743989956.jpg"></a></div> <p><span class="an_username"><a href="https://scribblehub.com/profile/149271/miriamrobern/">miriamrobern</a></span></div> <div style="clear: both;"></div> <div class="wi_authornotes_body"> <h2><b>Thanks for Reading!</b><b></b></h2> <p class="p6">If you’d like to see more like this, please consider subscribing to my patreon at http://patreon.com/miriamrobern</p> <ul class="ul1"> <li class="li7">I post all chapters a month early for subscribers, so you can read ahead.</li> <li class="li7">I also post epub and pdf versions of the book for everybody.</li> </ul> <p class="p6">Thanks for your support, whether it’s becoming a subscriber or posting comments online.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s people like you who let people like me make stuff like this!</p> <p> </p> </div></div></p> </div>

                <!-- Intentionally not escaping for html context -->
                <div class="chp_raw" id="chp_raw"><p class="p2">Finley was waiting outside the building when Sammy arrived for Biology.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They pushed themself off the wall to amble over to him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sammy couldn’t help but smile, and lifted his chin just slightly, hoping for a kiss.</p> <p class="p2">But Finley looked left and right awkwardly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Hey.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I mean.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Good morning.”</p> <p class="p2">A tendril of dread curled around Sammy’s heart.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Uh.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Good morning,” he managed.</p> <p class="p2">“Listen, I’m… pretty sure that it’s perfectly ethical for me to date you,” they said, voice kept low enough not to carry and with the measured cadence of rehearsed wording.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“But I’m not sure that the professor would see it that way.”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy looked from Finley to the door into the building, as if the professor in question would be standing there, glowering in disappointment at them both.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But it was just a flow of students heading into the building for morning classes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He said something intelligent, like “Oh, okay.”</p> <p class="p2">“You all right?” they asked, tipping their chin down to scrutinize his face.</p> <p class="p2">He nodded, smiled, lied.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Yeah, I’m fine.”</p> <p class="p2">Finley gestured at their own eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It just looked like you got kind of teary all the sudden.”</p> <p class="p2">“Wind, I guess?” he shrugged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He did not ask, “Are you breaking up with me?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Because they weren’t even together, right?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They’d been on one date.</p> <p class="p2">“The university code of ethics for TAs is really strident about dating students,” Finley was saying, “but that was negotiated with the TA Union, and I’m not allowed to join the TA Union for the summer program, so I’m not sure if their code of ethics even applies to me.”</p> <p class="p2">“Yeah, totally,” Sammy said, bobbing his head.</p> <p class="p2">“Anyway,” Finley sighed, and slipped their hands into the back pockets of their jeans.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“We just have to keep things quiet, okay?”</p> <p class="p2">“Yeah, I— I won’t tell anybody about last Friday,” Sammy promised, and forced himself to smirk.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It was just an apology dinner anyway, right?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That’s it, he thought to himself: deny everything, pretend it meant nothing, because then it won’t hurt to lose it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It wasn’t a strategy that had ever worked well for him, but one of these days, it might.</p> <p class="p2">“I seem to remember you wanting it to be a date,” they smirked back.</p> <p class="p2">Sammy’s smile grew wan as he answered automatically.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You asked me on a date,” he corrected, keeping his voice quiet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But his heart was thudding and he knew he had to cut this whole thing loose from his life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He heard himself saying,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“We can just call it a misunderstanding.”</p> <p class="p2">Finley stepped a little closer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Well this Friday is definitely a date, right?” they asked, elbows cocked behind them, hands kept rigidly in their pockets.</p> <p class="p2">Sammy’s brain ground to a halt.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He blinked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His heart lurched against the inside of his ribcage.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I thought… I thought you just said you couldn’t—”</p> <p class="p2">“I’m just not sure about what is and isn’t allowed,” Finley said with an elaborate roll of their shoulders, approximating a shrug.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“So we’ll need to keep things quiet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No flirting in class, or right outside of class.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That sort of thing.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They waggled their elbows behind their back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And I’ll keep my hands safely in my pockets, to resist temptation.”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy’s lips refused to put words together for a full thirty seconds.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Finally he managed, “…but keep dating.”</p> <p class="p2">Finley bobbed their head, grinning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Secret dating.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Kinda sexy, yeah?”</p> <p class="p2">Relief flooded through Sammy and he could feel his cheeks burning red.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Oh, yeah.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That’s um.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That’s totally cool.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Secret dating.”</p> <p class="p2">Finley threw him a wink and hooked a thumb behind themself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Okay.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Well I’ve got to get in there, I promised the class I wouldn’t be late again.”</p> <p class="p2">“Yeah, see you in there,” Sammy heard himself say.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“But I won’t, you know, flirt across the classroom or whatever.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But Finley was already bounding to the door and didn’t hear a word.</p> <hr /> <p class="p2">He’d shuffled and reshuffled his schedule, compacting a few blocks of reading and streamlining his essay-writing, to free up some time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’d managed to open up Tuesday evening, from seven to eight.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But he was still reading, sitting in front of his laptop, while the video chat service told him to wait to be admitted to the meeting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He needed every scrap of time he could get.</p> <p class="p2">He was still dressed up, not that he really stripped off his daily costume until it was time for bed most nights.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But when he’d got back from the dining commons, he’d touched up his make up and gave himself a once-over in the mirror.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Just a cami-and-cardi set, striped white and mint green, with matching hair clips to bring it all together.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was basically casualwear.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Especially since his black skirt with the lace edging was going to be out of frame, anyway.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But he wanted to look at least presentable for Rowan’s friend.</p> <p class="p2">Rowan’s friend, who needed work and refused to accept charity, who helped Rowan back when she needed it, and now Sammy could help her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’d been hoovering up privileges and opportunities—on Uncle Gideon’s advice to “take what you can get, babe,”—and if he could help somebody by spending an hour a week pretending to take voice lessons, well then, he was all for it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a dumb way to give back, he’d told himself at lunch, but it was what was available to him.</p> <p class="p2">The video conference lurched into activity with a tin-can bwong and the video pane lighting up with a smiling woman’s face.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Somewhere in her mid-thirties, Black, and wearing makeup that had probably been striking when she’d put it on earlier that day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She smiled out of Sammy’s laptop.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Samantha, right?”</p> <p class="p2">“That’s me,” Sammy nodded, suddenly more self-conscious of his voice than he’d ever been in his life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He put the biology textbook aside with shaky hands.</p> <p class="p2">“And I’m Vanessa,” she smiled welcomingly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She glanced down and shuffling paper came over the audio.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Checking her notes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Oh, you’re Rowan’s cousin, right?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How’s she doing?”</p> <p class="p2">“Kicking ass and taking names,” Sammy said with a weird laugh, and then wondered why he’d said that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Why was he so nervous?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But he decided to cover whatever nervousness he had by adding,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“At full volume, of course.”</p> <p class="p2">Vanessa laughed along as if any of that had made sense.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Yeah, she’s become quite outgoing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s been so good to see her coming into herself on social media, but you should have seen her back when I was coaching her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Timid little thing, afraid of her own shadow.”</p> <p class="p2">Wait, what?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sammy shook his head in disbelief.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I uh, only met her a few months ago,” he explained after a stunned moment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I can’t even imagine her as ‘timid.’”</p> <p class="p2">The voice coach cackled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“She was, she was.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Which only goes to show how dangerous voice training is: it’ll unlock things that nobody thought was inside you.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And at this she winked at him, as if he was in on the joke.</p> <p class="p2">But Sammy’s heart thudded.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This was supposed to be learning some parlour tricks so he could make his voice sound girly when he needed it to.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But now this was going to <i>unlock things?</i><i></i></p> <p class="p2">Vanessa was settling into her office chair and smiling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She’d just asked a question.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What had she said?</p> <p class="p2">“Sorry, you broke up,” he lied.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“What was that?”</p> <p class="p2">She smiled again, with the practiced confidence that knew exactly how bright and welcoming that smile was.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I asked you what you’d like to get out of voice training with me.”</p> <p class="p2">“Oh, uh…” he stammered.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I just want to… sound like a girl?”</p> <p class="p2">Vanessa gave him a look through the video chat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Okay so first, honey, you already sound like a girl, because you are a girl, yeah?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She speared him with eye contact until he nodded mutely.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“But leaving that aside.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There’s lots of ways to sound like a girl.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There’s lots of girls to sound like.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Have you given any thought to your options?”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy tried not to squirm in his desk chair.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Um.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Can you… I’m not sure what the options are?”</p> <p class="p2">“Well,” she said with an indulgent smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You can go perky,” she said like a helium-infused cheerleader, and then switched to “…or smokey and sultry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or more… girl next door.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That she delivered in a voice Sammy was sure he’d heard in a thousand teen drama shows.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“There is,” she went on, shifting her voice up and down and sideways to suit, “clipped, confident businesswoman or friendly midwestern housewife or hard-talking urbanite from the streets or bubbly ditz, tee hee.”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy boggled as Vanessa’s voice leapt and danced and changed, over and over again.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But beneath his amazement was a growing disquiet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This was the breast forms all over again.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Getting handed the proper way to be a girl was one thing; picking out the kind of girl he wanted to be was… daunting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Probably impossible.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Because he didn’t want any of this, any which way, right?</p> <p class="p2">Except.</p> <p class="p2">“Sometimes people give me… funny looks?” he heard himself say.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“When I talk, I mean.”</p> <p class="p2">Vanessa bobbed her head, her face a picture of sympathy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Yeah.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>People can be shit, huh?”</p> <p class="p2">“Yeah.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And I uh.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m not out, back home?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And in a few weeks I go back home for about a month, and I don’t want to…” he trailed off, unable to articulate the nightmare scenario blossoming in his head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Him slouching off the bus in hoodie and sweatpants, no tits and no bra even, greeting his parents in a bright, lilting falsetto that he couldn’t stop.</p> <p class="p2">The voice coach saved him from spiralling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Nothing we do is permanent,” she promised.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And you can retain your masculine voice as long as you like.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Switch back and forth as you need.”</p> <p class="p2">He nodded slowly, slightly mollified.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A thought occured to him, and he looked up at the screen.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rowan had said Vanessa was trans, didn’t she?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Which meant—<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Does that mean that you can…?”</p> <p class="p2">The woman’s lips twisted slightly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You can lose your masculine voice,” she admitted, “if you don’t ever use it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But that takes months.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And that is what I did, years ago now, before I knew I wanted to do this.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So I had to go searching for my old masc voice, or something close to it, and… I’m afraid I sound like a woman making fun of how a man talks, now.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She smirked and cleared her throat, and when she spoke it came out deep and rough, and just slightly laughable: “But it’s good enough to demonstrate the fundamentals.”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy snorted in surprise, hands flying up to cover his lips.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m sorry, I just—”</p> <p class="p2">“No apologies necessary, I know how I sound,” Vanessa replied, back in her normal voice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Face still full of sympathy, she added, “But we’ve gone the long way around to dodge the original question.”</p> <p class="p2">Deflating a little, Sammy nodded.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Yeah, I uh.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I don’t really know what I want to sound like.”</p> <p class="p2">“That’s fine, honey,” she responded gently.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“We don’t need to have a destination in mind.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What we can do is work on expanding your range, in both pitch and resonance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And probably do a little breath work and shake up your cadences a little bit.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Later we’ll worry about fine-tuning with creak and breathiness.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And I know I’m throwing a ton of new terminology at you—”</p> <p class="p2">“That’s kind of my life right now,” Sammy cut in with a smirk.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“So don’t worry about it.”</p> <p class="p2">Vanessa hit him with the smile again.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Okay.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But the point is: we can go looking for a voice that suits you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Kind of explore the territory, see what we can find, see what you’re comfortable with.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In my experience, most girls find something that just clicks for them, and then we’re off to the races.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sound good?”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy nodded slowly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This was sounding more like what he’d hoped for: some tricks to learn that he could bring out when needed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He didn’t need to unlock anything.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Yeah, let’s do it.”</p> <p class="p2">“Great,” she smiled, and he realized that it wouldn’t be long at all before he’d do his best just to make her smile at him like that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Well, we’ve still got a chunk of time left in the hour, so let’s start on some exercises.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How do you feel about making a bunch of funny sounds?”</p> <hr /> <p class="p2">“I take it back,” declared Leon a moment after his tray clattered onto the table next to Sammy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I dread the Literature class and the Composition class and also the History class.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His bag hit the floor and he slumped into his chair.</p> <p class="p2">Sammy looked up from his reading.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His own lunch, half-eaten, had been pushed to the side a while ago.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He still had three chapters of <i>Persuasion</i> to polish off before class tomorrow, but he slid a finger into the book to hold his place.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He lifted his eyebrows to show he was listening.</p> <p class="p2">“In Ukraine, history is names and dates and nations and movements…” Leon griped, and put extra emphasis on “…and <i>events</i>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>History is the story of what happened, yes?”</p> <p class="p2">“Gid— er, Doctor Roth-Masters said we’d get to all the names and dates eventually,” Sammy pointed out.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“We’re just not starting there.”</p> <p class="p2">“But what are we starting with?” Leon responded rhetorically, and shoved half of his burger into his face.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He went on with a full mouth, which Sammy tried not to look at directly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Patriarchy? Homophobia? Feminism?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Theories and theories and theories, nothing—” He waved his burger, which dripped ketchup onto his fries, and swallowed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“—nothing substantial.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Nothing concrete.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not like Ukraine.”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy shrugged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“But that’s the point of the Marginalized Scholars Program, right?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To teach you how to do academic stuff the American way.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although,” he stumbled, and then confessed: “I didn’t really pay much attention in high school history, so I can’t really tell you if that’s what I missed in the US version of history class.”</p> <p class="p2">“Pretty sure your high school,” Leon said, emphasizing ‘high school’ like it was a bizarre, alien concept, which Sammy supposed it was, to him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“They didn’t teach you that, what, homophobia is the immune system of patriarchy and used to quash dissent within the state.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And the state is, of course, a patriarchal structure in and of itself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Everything is patriarchy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Everything bad, at least.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And this is history?”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy considered the young man from Ukraine for a long moment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“So just… to be clear, you’re straight, right?”</p> <p class="p2">Leon’s eyes slitted slightly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Yes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But that shouldn’t matter to the ideas. The ideas should be true no matter what my sexuality.”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy waved his hands to quash Leon’s preemptive response, and sat up a little in his chair.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“But it does matter to how you hear the ideas.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Where you’re coming from, the experiences that you’ve had in your life so far, they have an effect on how new ideas sound to you.”</p> <p class="p2">Leon frowned softly, nodded reluctantly, and consoled himself by making the rest of his burger disappear.</p> <p class="p2">“Because like, I’m queer, right?” Sammy went on, patting his collarbone (his fingertips touched skin and not fabric and he really should be used to that by now, right?).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And so from where I’m standing?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Based on what I’ve experienced in the world?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Homophobia being the thing that keeps everybody in line? That makes perfect fucking sense to me.”</p> <p class="p2">Leon shook his head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“But homophobia is just the fear of gay people,” Leon protested, gesturing with a french fry.</p> <p class="p2">“It’s not fear of, like individual gay people; it’s the fear of gay<i>ness</i>,” Sammy corrected, and then clarified: “Of queerness.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s the fear that, at any time, for any number of random-ass reasons, somebody might think you’re queer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That you’re not measuring up, that you’re not acting your part, that you’re less worthy of respect.”</p> <p class="p2">Leon’s face placed him somewhere between skeptical and uncomfortable.</p> <p class="p2">“Cause me?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That’s my every day,” he pressed on.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Because I am queer, so when I get clocked as queer, I know what’s happening, cause I’m always hyper-aware of it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And when somebody decides that they think you’re queer, you can <i>see</i> them respect you less.”</p> <p class="p2">Leon wasn’t convinced.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m sorry, that does sound terrible, but it only explains the oppression of queer people.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s not the… foundation of empire that the professor made it out to be.”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy waved his hands in frustration.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This had been so clear to him in class; why couldn’t he explain it now?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You’re looking at it like it’s something that happens to just me, but it’s happening to everybody, all the time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Homophobia means that everybody’s constantly watching everybody else to make sure they don’t act queer. And that makes everybody a little bit scared, a little bit easier to control.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Easier to take advantage of by the, uh—”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He struggled to remember the right word, and then it popped into his brain and he snapped his fingers. “The elites, right?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When everybody else is scared of getting called queer, or not manly enough, or not fulfilling their womanly duties or whatever, and they go along with all that bullshit to avoid it, then they’re more likely to go along with other bullshit, too.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That’s what Gid— that’s what Doctor Roth-Masters was after in class today.”</p> <p class="p2">Leon scrunched up his face, considering.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Is conditioning, then, yeah?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hm,” he finally said, nodding slightly, which seemed to be, if not agreement, at least understanding.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He ate a few more fries and Sammy was about to go back to his book, when Leon asked, “So you are queer?”</p> <p class="p2">“Uh, yeah.”</p> <p class="p2">“So you like girls?” he asked, speculatively.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I am unsure if transgender counts as queer or is something separate.”</p> <p class="p2">“Oh, uh,” Sammy stammered.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Right.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was a trans girl, at least for the purposes of this conversation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I mean, it’s… complicated.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Trans people are queers, but some are straight, but they’re still queers.”</p> <p class="p2">“That makes no sense,” Leon told him flatly, and then pointed a french fry at Sammy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“But you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You are transgender, sure.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But you like boys, so you are a straight queer?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or you like girls, and then you are a queer queer?”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy tried not to laugh at Leon’s earnestly-delivered question.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I like… both?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And nonbinary people, too.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I mean.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All that doesn’t really matter to me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At least,” he added hastily, “for, uh, romantic partners.”</p> <p class="p2">“Are you seeing anybody now?” Leon asked, entirely too casually, not making eye contact.</p> <p class="p2">Urk.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Leon was nice and all, but Sammy was less than interested in his romantic attention.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He and Finn were supposed to be keeping things quiet; could he even say yes, he was already spoken for?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Maybe if he was very stingy with details.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Um.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am, actually,” he said carefully.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Not a student here.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Technically true, since Finley had graduated a month ago.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And with my class load, we just see each other on weekends.”</p> <p class="p2">The boy from Ukraine nodded for a moment, and when he looked up he smiled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Good for you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I hope he makes you happy.”</p> <p class="p2">“They,” Sammy corrected after a moment of consideration.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There were lots of nonbinary people, right?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He could be dating any of them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“They make me happy.”</p> <hr /> <p class="p2">‘Eeee eeee eeee eeee,” chirped Sammy at higher and higher pitches.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He had his phone up in front of his face like some boomer on a video call, watching the numbers rating his pitch wobble higher and then lower again.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The concrete blocks of his dorm room surrounded him, hopefully affording enough sound insulation that his neighbours wouldn’t hear… whatever this was.</p> <p class="p2">Voice training wasn’t just one hour of video conference a week, it was that plus exercises every day, exercises that Vanessa had said he could plow through in fifteen minutes but if he did he’d be robbing himself of any progress.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So here he was, taking his time to make funny sounds into his phone, filling up the hour he’d somehow managed to scrape out of his already-jam-packed schedule.</p> <p class="p2">“Eeee eeee eeee, eeeeeee!” he squeaked, and then coughed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That last one had crossed over into falsetto, maybe, which he was supposed to avoid.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The only problem was that he couldn’t really tell the difference between the top of his normal range and the forbidden zone above that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But falsetto or not, that ‘eeee’ had set something in his nasal passages quivering in a very unpleasant way, so he was happy to call it falsetto and not do it again.</p> <p class="p2">He lifted his phone to start again and a text message popped onto the screen.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Finley, saying: <span class="s1">Hey.</span></p> <p class="p2">Frowning softly, Sammy wiped the text message away.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’d respond after he was done eeee-eeee-eeeeing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But he’d only got two ‘eeee’s in when another text came in.</p> <p class="p2">Finley again: <span class="s1">Whatcha up to?</span></p> <p class="p2">The cheap freebie app that measured pitch didn’t know what to do with the phone vibration brought on by the text message and simply stalled out.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sammy’s precarious flow on the awkward task of tweaking his voice had been thrown off, too.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He decided to take a short break, and collapsed backwards into his desk chair.</p> <p class="p2"><span class="s1">Studying, of course,</span> he texted back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Voice training was a kind of studying, right?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He didn’t want to explain that he was doing voice training on top of everything else, or why.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He felt foolish devoting so much time to this thing he didn’t really want, but he also couldn’t not do the thing he’d told both Rowan and Vanessa that he’d do.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><span class="s1">All I do is study.</span></p> <p class="p2"><span class="s1">I could fix that for you.</span> Finley texted back, with a winky face.</p> <p class="p2">Sammy couldn’t help smiling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><span class="s1">Oh?</span></p> <p class="p2">Finley responded with a photo, two pints of ice cream in one of their hands (the green nail polish gave their identity away), plus a pair of spoons sticking out from underneath.</p> <p class="p4"><span class="s2">Rolling his eyes, Sammy tapped out: </span>You’re sweet but I’m not getting on a subway to come eat ice cream.</p> <p class="p4">Okay, first of all,<span class="s2"> came Finley’s immediate response, </span>you are on record as saying you would never say no to ice cream.</p> <p class="p2">Sammy smirked, but didn’t answer because the dots were already bouncing, heralding another text.</p> <p class="p4">Secondly,<span class="s2"> they went on, </span>I’m downstairs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Just buzz me in.</p> <p class="p2">“What?” muttered Sammy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He enlarged the ice cream photo and, sure enough, he recognized the concrete stoop in the background.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That was his dorm’s porch.</p> <p class="p2">He was supposed to do fifteen more minutes of voice exercises, and then he had an essay revision for Comp in the morning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’d also scheduled a review of the week’s Physics material for the quiz that may or may not happen on Friday.</p> <p class="p2">But he rolled across the room to jam his finger on the button to let Finley into the dorm.</p> <hr /> <p class="p2">“And then what happened?” Rowan wanted to know.</p> <p class="p2">Sammy smiled at the video chat, trying not to blush.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“We ate ice cream and cuddled a little as we watched a movie.”</p> <p class="p2">His cousin lifted one eyebrow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Cuddled a little?”</p> <p class="p2">“Do I have to define cuddling for you?”</p> <p class="p2">“In this instance, yes,” Rowan nodded emphatically.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Were clothes involved?”</p> <p class="p2">“Of course clothes were— Jesus, Rowan!”</p> <p class="p2">“Cuddling is better without clothes,” opined Zoey. “That’s just science.”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy groaned at the ceiling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“We kissed, we made out a bit, there was some… light petting.”</p> <p class="p2">Rowan looked confused.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’ve heard of heavy petting, but is light petting even a thing?”</p> <p class="p2">Zoey shrugged theatrically.</p> <p class="p2">“Okay fuck you,” he told the screen lovingly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“All I’m saying is my gentlethem caller brought me ice cream last night and I thought it was sweet of them.”</p> <p class="p2">Zoey tilted her head quizzically, “A bit early in the relationship to attempt a booty call, isn’t it?”</p> <p class="p2">“It wasn’t a booty call,” he all but howled, “because there wasn’t any sex.”</p> <p class="p2">Rowan smirked, and Sammy could tell the look was meant for Rowan, not him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I mean, most attempted booty calls don’t result in sex.”</p> <p class="p2">“You guys are terrible and I have a study group to get to,” he told the screen.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Chat again tomorrow?”</p> <hr /> <p class="p2">Sammy felt self-conscious the whole way there, clutching his silly little picnic basket and fretting that making the date he’d planned “a surprise” was sort of silly, since he was literally lugging a picnic basket onto the subway.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All he’d divulged was that they’d be active, so wear some sensible shoes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Which Finley had taken to mean dress casual: a band tee shirt, jeans shorts, and tennis shoes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That meant Sammy, in tight light jeans and a flowy pale pink blouse plus still-pristine frat shoes, looked just a bit overdressed in comparison.</p> <p class="p2">Worse, he realized: standing next to each other, they looked like a straight couple.</p> <p class="p2">They made small talk on the subway, with Sammy’s attention split between Finley talking about their roommates’ hijinx and the automated subway announcements.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He didn’t want to miss their stop.</p> <p class="p2">And then he led them into Central Park.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The day was warm and clear, perfect weather for picnicking.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Given it was a Friday afternoon in the summer, the green landscape was dotted with people taking advantage of the massive park.</p> <p class="p2">Frustratingly, he had to drop Finley’s hand to check the map on his phone, but then he set it down on the flat top of the picnic basket so he could glance down at it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His free hand found its way back to Finley’s.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was surprised how soon they came up on their destination: a scenic pond with a fake castle rising up on the opposite side.</p> <p class="p2">There were a few other people scattered about, some of them on their own picnic blankets.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sammy led his date to an open spot and turned to face them, both hands clutching the basket handles.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s a picnic,” he explained.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I packed us a picnic.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And it’s… pretty here.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And afterwards, I made us reservations at the Metropolitain Museum of Art.”</p> <p class="p2">Finley grinned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I love the Met!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And a picnic sounds great.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Where’d you get the basket?”</p> <p class="p2">“My uncles,” he said with a shrug.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“So you’ve been before?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To the Met?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’d told himself that his date idea probably wasn’t terribly original, and the museum wasn’t going to be anything Finley hadn’t already done before, but he’d still held out some stupid hope that it would all be new and exciting.</p> <p class="p2">“I mean, yeah, I’ve lived here for four years, I’ve been,” they said with a gentle smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“But not for ages.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m excited to go!”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy set the basket down to open it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Finley had clearly noticed his anxiety over the date and was trying to mollify his fears.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He wasn’t sure if he liked that they’d noticed and that they cared or if it only made him more self-conscious.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’d never planned a date before, and he wanted so much for this to go well that he knew he’d start flailing if he thought about it too much.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I, uh, I looked online for date ideas.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Picnicking at the Turtle Pond seemed nice, and with the Metrop— I mean, the Met, right there…”</p> <p class="p2">Finley reached out to take the other side of the thin picnic blanket and help stretch it out across the grass.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Absolutely.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Samantha, this is great.”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy unpacked the picnic lunch, which was mostly just sandwiches and fruit and a sort of half-assed charcuterie board, minus the board.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Finley laid across the opposite side of the blanket, watching with a bemused little smile on their face.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When he looked up to explain what he’d packed for their picnic—which was all obvious, really, but still—his date just smiled and said, “You’re adorable.”</p> <p class="p2">Whatever Sammy was about to say was lost under his sudden full-body flush.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s just a picnic.”</p> <p class="p2">“And you care a whole lot about making it just right,” his date pointed out.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Which is nice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It makes me feel good that you care about the details.”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy sniggered, and when Finley raised an eyebrow at the odd reaction, he explained: “Me caring makes you feel good, but you telling me about me caring is just you caring about me feeling anxious, and it’s just like… a big echo chamber or something.”</p> <p class="p2">“Exactly,” his date smiled, and picked up one of the soda bottles that had rolled out onto the blanket.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They held it out in toast.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Here’s to echo chambers of caring.”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy scooped up the other soda bottle and tapped its neck against Finley’s.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m not sure we’re supposed to be this sappy on Date Number Two.”</p> <p class="p2">“Is it Date Number Two, though?”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy handed Finley a sandwich and then levelled a warning finger at them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You asked me out first.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Last week was a date.”</p> <p class="p2">They lifted their hands as if they were being held up at gunpoint instead of fingerpoint, trying to look innocent.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I wasn’t saying this was Date Number One.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was just thinking after Wednesday, maybe this counts as Date Number Three.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They unwrapped the sandwich and made appreciatory noises at the contents: his mother’s chicken salad.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Maybe even Date Number Four if we count our first kiss.”</p> <p class="p2">“Okay, now you’re reaching,” Sammy laughed, settling more comfortably on his side of the blanket.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“May I remind you that I kissed three other people that night, too—at your direction.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Kind of weird.”</p> <p class="p2">“Kind of sexy,” Finley shot back, grinning.</p> <p class="p2">Sammy busied himself with his food, ignoring Finley’s eyes on him until it became unbearable.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Finally, he allowed, quietly, talking almost directly into his sandwich, “Yeah, it was.”</p> <p class="p2">They ate in companionable silence for a little while, enjoying the simply made food and artfully constructed view.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sammy regretted sitting opposite Finley; he wanted to cuddle, but he also wasn’t quite sure how cuddling would work with picnicking at the same time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There had been a lot of juggling with the ice cream on Wednesday.</p> <p class="p2">He snorted in sudden amusement, and told Finley, “I told Rowan and Zoey about you showing up with ice cream, and they thought it was a booty call.”</p> <p class="p2">Finley quickly took a pull of their soda, covering for something.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“…ha ha, yeah, that’s funny.”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy looked across the picnic blanket, eyebrows raised.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Okay, that was a lot of hesitation and not the quick denial I was expecting.”</p> <p class="p2">Finley collapsed onto their back instead of making eye contact.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Um.”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy leaned a little closer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Was Finley… actually blushing under their beard?</p> <p class="p2">They looked up into Sammy’s face, smiling faintly and apologetically.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It wasn’t a… booty call booty call, but it was… the same impulse, I guess?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When Sammy only lifted his eyebrows, Finley tried to explain: “When you’re in a relationship—”</p> <p class="p2">“We’re in a relationship, now?” he asked in mock surprise.</p> <p class="p2">Finley covered their face with their hands.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I swear to god, Samantha, half of your transition is just you getting sassier.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Shut up, let me finish.”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy gave them an expansively sassy gesture to continue.</p> <p class="p2">They repeated, “When you’re in a relationship,” and then cleared their throat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Sometimes you just… want to see your person.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They tried to shrug into the ground, which only bunched up the blanket underneath them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And sure, if it’s a sexual relationship, that maybe-probably involves sex, but if it’s not a sexual relationship yet, maybe it just means… making out while you watch a movie.”</p> <p class="p2">While Finley was focused on explaining themself, Sammy had taken the opportunity to creep a little closer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He wasn’t quite looming, but he was smiling down into Finley’s face.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The genderqueer’s features were all twisted up, uncertain how their explanation would be received.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“That’s sweet,” Sammy told them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And I totally get what you’re saying, I accept your explanation, and I’d like to go back to the part where we’re in a relationship.”</p> <p class="p2">Finley heaved a relieved exhale while also rolling their eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Not going to let that go, are you?”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy leaned down slowly, descending until Finley’s lips puckered for a kiss, and then he stopped, smirking, withholding.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Nope.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He could feel Finley’s breath on his face.</p> <p class="p2">“I feel like I need to reiterate that I’m leaving in five weeks,” Finley said soberly, and then smiled ever so softly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“But until then, I think I would like to call this a relationship.”</p> <p class="p2">Giggling in unabashed delight, Sammy closed the remaining distance between their lips and kissed them, hard.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He broke off long enough to breathe, “Yes, please.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And then for a little while they were both a tangle of limbs on top of smooshed sandwiches and tumbled tupperware.</p> <p class="p2">When they separated, Sammy back lay on the grass (the blanket sat in a tangled heap three feet away) to catch his breath.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His body still seemed to be fizzing and popping, heart hammering, head spinning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Finley lay beside him, their only contact two of the genderqueer’s fingers lightly stroking the side of Sammy’s thigh.</p> <p class="p2">After a long moment of fingertip caresses and watching the clouds gather in the sunset lighting, Finley spoke up: “Okay, because it’s always a thing at this point?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I prefer enbyfriend.”</p> <p class="p2">“What?” Sammy couldn’t help asking the sky.</p> <p class="p2">Finley propped themself up on an elbow to make eye contact.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“‘Datemate’ always sounds weird to me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The rhyming, I think.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And ‘theyfriend’ and ‘themfriend’ are just… this whole thing with confusing pronouns for genders?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Pet peeve of mine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You can call me your enbyfriend.”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy smiled up at them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“This is Finley Aceves,” he said, gesturing with one hand as if he were introducing people, even though he was laying on the ground and didn’t quite have the right range of motion.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“My enbyfriend.”</p> <p class="p2">They definitely blushed, this time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Yeah.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sammy’s enbyfriend laid a hand on his belly, warm through the thin fabric of his blouse.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And I take it you’d like to be my girlfriend?”</p> <p class="p2">His heart skipped a beat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Fuck.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Why had this not occured to him?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Yeah,” he heard himself say in a smiling exhale.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That was not the right answer, nor was it the right word, but it was the best he was going to get, wasn’t it?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s not like he could confess everything to Finley here and now, tell them that he wasn’t really a girl, he just pretended for… reasons even he was having trouble articulating, anymore.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was just too much to explain right now, in this moment, and the last thing he wanted was to ruin this moment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So he smiled again and said, “I’m your girlfriend.”</p> <hr /> <p class="p2">The Metropolitain Museum of Art was a blur.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He rented a locker for the picnic basket and they walked, hand in hand, through exhibit after exhibit.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Egyptian art, Roman art, European art, American art, Japanese art.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But Sammy barely saw any of it.</p> <p class="p2">He was Finley’s girlfriend.</p> <p class="p2">There was a room full of instruments, for some reason.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You could push buttons to make them make noises.</p> <p class="p2">He was Finley’s girlfriend.</p> <p class="p2">There were suits of armor, for people and for horses, and Finley made a joke about codpieces that Sammy just barely realized wasn’t serious commentary before he nodded along with it.</p> <p class="p2">He was the girlfriend.</p> <p class="p2">There was a whole stone temple, transplanted from wherever the colonizers had uprooted it from.</p> <p class="p2">Girlfriend.</p> <p class="p2">He couldn’t even translate it in his head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For a little while—through the whole Impressionists section, in fact—he wondered if, when Finley or somebody else said “girlfriend,” his brain could just find-replace into something more appropriate, so inside his head he could be Finley’s—well, boyfriend.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But that fantasy dissolved as soon as Finn asked one of the docents for directions, saying “my girlfriend and I,” and his brain didn’t find-replace, it didn’t come up with anything more appropriate, it just sort of sat there in his skull and drooled.</p> <p class="p2">He was back at that CQA meeting, on Finley’s arm again, everybody looking at them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Everyone seeing Finley and their girlfriend, the trans girl, which meant that they must—</p> <p class="p2">Finley asked if Sammy would mind if they bought a cinnamon roll from the cafe for them to share.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He said no, of course not, why would he mind, and it wasn’t until they were sitting down at the table that he remembered that this was his date and maybe he should have done that, or planned for it, or something.</p> <p class="p2">Which was when Finley gave him a piercing look across the table. “Samantha, are you okay?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You’ve been kind of… not all here.”</p> <p class="p2">Oh, fuck, now he really was ruining the date.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sammy blinked rapidly, shook his head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Pushed through the cobwebs when they didn’t clear on their own.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“No, I’m good.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m good.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I just.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A thought struck him, made him laugh, and then he had to say it out loud. “I never thought I’d be somebody’s girlfriend.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was, after all, the truth.</p> <p class="p2">Finley made a satisfied little sound and held out a forkful of steaming cinnamon roll.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Well you’re mine,” they purred.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Until you get tired of me.”</p> <p class="p2">“Or until five weeks is up.”</p> <p class="p2">They rolled their eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Put this in your mouth and stop talking.”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy did as he was told.</p> <p class="p2">“Sometimes I forget this really is your first rodeo,” Finley said while he chewed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“There’s a whole lot of feelings.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This isn’t even my first time and I’ve got lots of feelings.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But the first time, it’s huge and intimidating—”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy opened his mouth to say something and had it stuffed with cinnamon roll, instead.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Finley gave him a warning look, so he chewed.</p> <p class="p2">“You’re my girlfriend,” they said insistently, and then couldn’t help smiling at the statement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And none of your feelings are too big or too much for me, okay?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I look forward to hearing all about all your feelings… that means all your fears and all your misgivings, too.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They reached forward to wipe a dribble of syrup off his chin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You never have to hold back with me.”</p> <p class="p2">He waved a hand around and around over his head, and Finley’s fork stilled, tacitly allowing him to speak.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Its all kind of spiralling around in here,” he admitted.</p> <p class="p2">“Not too surprising.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His enbyfriend mirrored the twirling gesture with the bit of cinnamon roll on their fork, and then popped it in their own mouth.</p> <p class="p2">Sammy looked left and right; the museum was emptying out, the end of the day approaching, with fewer and fewer people around.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One woman walked purposefully from some half-hidden exhibit and across the interior plaza, and for a moment their eyes met.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She looked from Sammy to Finley and back, smiled, and went on her way.</p> <p class="p2">They looked like a couple.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He looked like Finley’s girlfriend.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He also looked trans, which meant, when the lights were out and the making out escalated to something more…</p> <p class="p2">Suddenly he was reminded of Uncle Gideon lecturing, and Leon complaining about Uncle Gideon lecturing, and Sammy himself explaining to Leon about what Gideon had been lecturing about, and that was it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That was exactly it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sammy could feel the eyes on him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was being watched, he was being evaluated, he was being judged.</p> <p class="p2">And for some reason he was going along with it.</p> <p class="p2">He opened his mouth to speak and had to wave off another bite of cinnamon roll.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“No, um.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you really do want to hear some of the… stuff in my head—”</p> <p class="p2">“I do,” they nodded, and fed themself the lingering bite.</p> <p class="p2">He dithered again, and then chided himself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even if this was a real relationship now, it still had its expiration date; it was still, essentially, Sammy’s practice relationship.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He could throw caution to the wind, right?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He could say anything.</p> <p class="p2">“I’m anxious about butt sex,” he said, and Finley nearly choked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Sorry, too much?”</p> <p class="p2">“No, no,” his enbyfriend assured him as they spared a glance around to make sure nobody was sitting nearby.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The museum really was emptying out.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Just surprising.”</p> <p class="p2">“That was what freaked me out, back at the CQA mixer,” Sammy confessed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“That people would think that you were…”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He rolled his eyes at himself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“That you were fucking me like that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Which is stupid, even if I didn’t know it then, and I know it now and I feel foolish for worrying about it then but I also still worry about it now, a little.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not that people will think that—well, not entirely that people will think that—but also just because… I don’t really know how it even works?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And if I… if I am your girlfriend—”</p> <p class="p2">“Okay, let me stop you there,” they cut in, and supplemented the interruption by feeding him a bite of cinnamon roll.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They’d reached the center, and everything was especially gooey, now.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You being my girlfriend does not require or even imply anything about anal sex.”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy was slightly relieved that even Finley dropped their volume at ‘anal sex.’<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He nodded slowly, swallowed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Finley quickly replaced the bite to keep him quiet.</p> <p class="p2">“I am in no rush, okay?” his enbyfriend assured him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Maybe we get there, maybe we don’t.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’d much rather enjoy the journey than worry about any particular destination along the way.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Which means I would, if it’s all right with you, really like to make out before this date is over.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And nothing more than making out.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Okay?”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy nodded, smiled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Okay.”</p> <hr /> <p class="p2">The problem with that plan, however, was that just a few minutes into making out in his dorm room, Sammy had his hands down Finley’s shorts and they had theirs up his blouse, and ‘just making out’ didn’t just seem needlessly limiting but rather increasingly impossible.</p> <p class="p2">Sammy’s hips had started grinding on Finley’s leg in a way that he didn’t think he could willfully stop.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He had a handful of their ass and wanted nothing more than to pull them into himself… somehow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The actual details of geometry involved weren’t especially clear.</p> <p class="p2">It was Finley who finally broke off, panting, planting hands on top of Sammy’s shoulders and pushing to separate them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I should probably go.”</p> <p class="p2">“You should stop being so considerate,” Sammy told them in between gasps, smiling wide and biting his lip and yes, Finley’s eyes went right to the intersection of his teeth and bottom lip.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was going to have to remember that trick.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And stay.”</p> <p class="p2">Finley backpedalled in the half-dark room, smiling like a kid presented with a pile of candy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I want to save some of this—” and here he gestured vaguely up and down Sammy’s body, and also the space between them “—for later, to savour.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I don’t want to rush.”</p> <p class="p2">“I kinda do.”</p> <p class="p2">That got a laugh out of Finley, and the heat of the moment seemed to dissipate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Yeah, I can tell.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You are a very tempting… temptress.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Oof.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s late, and I’m tired, and that alone is a pretty good reason not to jump into our first time.”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy rolled his eyes but settled down to sit on his bed, arms folded.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“That probably makes sense.”</p> <p class="p2">“Now.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They looked Sammy up and down again, this time like he was a trap that might spring on them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Can I kiss you goodnight without you dragging me back into your bed, temptress?”</p> <p class="p2">“No promises,” he answered, but planted his hands at his sides and leaned forward, lips puckered.</p> <p class="p2">They shared a long but mostly chaste kiss, and then Finley hurried out the door.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Walking a little funny, Sammy noted with satisfaction.</p> <p class="p2">He threw himself backwards onto the bed with a sigh.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He could feel that too-many-emotions exhaution creeping up on him, and grudgingly acknowledged that perhaps Finley had been right, after all.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If he had kept pushing and overloaded himself, who knows where he’d have ended up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Probably crying into Finley’s lap.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or their naked crotch.</p> <p class="p2">Well that was an interesting image to consider.</p> <p class="p2">He pulled his little purse out of the picnic basket on the floor, and then pulled his phone out of that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>10:20.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He nodded to himself and opened up the texting app.</p> <p class="p4"><strong>Home safe after picnic date,</strong><span class="s2"> he told Rowan.</span></p> <p class="p4"><strong>Early bird!</strong><span class="s2"> she responded almost immediately.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></span><strong>I’m just about to head out.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How’d it go?</strong></p> <p class="p2">There were so many ways to answer that question, but he finally settled on,<strong> <span class="s1">I’m Finley’s girlfriend.</span></strong></p> <p class="p2">Rowan responded with a gleeful torrent of emojis and gifs.</p> <p class="p2">Sammy set the phone on his desk and shifted his butt over to sit in the chair.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The images kept coming on his phone while he woke up his laptop, checked his calendar, and opened the rough draft for his LIT50 essay.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He looked tiredly at the long series of paragraphs, fixed a misplaced comma, then leaned back in his chair and picked up his finally quiescent phone.</p> <p class="p4"><strong>Is it sad that I scheduled study time for after my date?</strong><span class="s2"> he texted.</span></p> <p class="p4"><strong>No that’s good</strong>,<span class="s2"> his cousin replied.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></span><strong>You should get as far ahead as you can.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s not like you’re getting anything done next week.</strong></p> <p class="p2">He frowned softly at his phone and texted a single question mark.</p> <p class="p4"><strong>It’s PRIDE, Sammy!</strong><span class="s2"> came the response.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></span><strong>Next week is Pride!</strong></p> <p class="p4"><strong>Isn’t that just like… a parade?</strong></p> <p class="p2">Rowan reply was only: <strong><span class="s1">Oh, Country Mouse.</span></strong></p> <div class="wi_authornotes"> <div>

                <!-- Intentionally not escaping for html context -->
                <div class="chp_raw" id="chp_raw"><p class="p4"><i>Sussex, May 1813</i><i></i></p> <p class="p4">Amelia woke without the warm weight of Theresa in the bed beside her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It took her few confused minutes to realize her lover was across the room, sitting by the window and watching the morning sun spread across the estate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She was beautiful there, in the sharp angled sunlight with one of Amelia’s shawls wrapped around her shoulders.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Amelia admired her silently for a long while before wishing her good morning.</p> <p class="p4">“Good morning,” her lover responded, distracted, and then asked, “My dear Duchess Regent, how much is the duchy worth?”</p> <p class="p4">Amelia rubbed the sleep out of her eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It appeared the day was eager to get started, making her own preference for lounging in bed irrelevant.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You mean the estate?” she asked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Technically the duchy’s not really worth anything, monetarily.”</p> <p class="p4">Theresa shot her a warm smile full of fascination.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Yes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The ducal estate that is synonymous with the duchy, which you have an adorable way of seeing as a wholly disparate thing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How much is it worth?”</p> <p class="p4">“Well,” she responded, trying to goad her brain into motion, “it can’t really be liquidated.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Large portions of the estate are entailed to the title, and the value of much of it depends on ancestral rights that would not be transferred in any sale.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So it’s impossible to really ennumerate the assets.”</p> <p class="p4">“That sounds like a dodge embedded so deep in the status quo that you lot don’t even notice you’re using it,” Theresa chided in good nature.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Let me ask it another way: how much income does it bring in?”</p> <p class="p4">Having just gone over the numbers with Julian, and then having gone over them again with the boys, Amelia had those details at her mental fingertips.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She told her, itemizing out the estate proper as well as the investments and bonds that were tied to the estate’s finances.</p> <p class="p4">Theresa Chesterley’s eyebrows tried to float off of her face.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“More than I expected.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Orders of magnitude larger than my own little trust.”</p> <p class="p4">“Well,” Amelia tried to say reasonably, piling up pillow roll and cushions behind her on the headboard.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“That sum supports the five people in the house, the staff of twenty-two, and hundreds of people attached to the estate in various ways.”</p> <p class="p4">Her lover wobbled her head side to side again.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“But still.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I can’t help imagining what good I could do with a sum of that size.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s just where my mind immediately jumps when it hears the number.”</p> <p class="p4">“I don’t think that’s unreasonable,” said Amelia with a soft smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She knew the numbers could be intimidating, and the last thing she wanted was to make her lover feel embarrassed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But she also quietly resolved not to mention the duchy’s other estates, either.</p> <p class="p4">Theresa’s lips twisted mischieviously.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Do you know how many looms and frames we could destroy with that?” she asked, and then continued dreamily.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“How many schools we could build.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How many ragged little girls on the London streets we could teach to read?”</p> <p class="p4">“Mother does a great deal of work with the unfortunates of Brighton,” Amelia offered, but then immediately shook her head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It hardly compares with what you’re imagining, though, I’m sure.”</p> <p class="p4">Her lover smiled across the room at her, amused and wistful.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Not really, no.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She looked about to say something else, and then shook her head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“My duchess, you look lovely over there, all tousled and cozy.”</p> <p class="p4">Amelia opened her arms to her lover.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“We have a little time before breakfast.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Come cozy up and I’ll tousle you.”</p> <p class="p4">Having had their horse ride the day before, Amelia and Theresa took the boys for a walk after breakfast.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Under a copse of willows, Theresa finished her history of London, complemented by a double handful of jelly tarts she’d tied up in a handkerchief.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The boys were vocally appreciative of both, to Amelia’s bemused gratification.</p> <p class="p4">They returned to the house for luncheon and Theresa excused herself to attend to her correspondence.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Amelia took the boys to watch the workers at the ice house, knowing that after not going the day before, they’d both be adamant in going today.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They settled on a slight rise above the build site, watching the workers bustle about their business.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She’d brought along paper, pencils, compass, and square, and cajoled them to work out the surface areas of the nascent building’s sides.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With Eustace she went further, itemizing out the cost of lumber.</p> <p class="p4">“It’s a great expense,” the boy opined.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I wonder why Youngest even wants it built.”</p> <p class="p4">Amelia tried to hide her smirk at the spread of her strange sobriquet to even the boys.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I take it you’ve never spent a summer in Sussex.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It gets so hot that an iced drink feels like the most welcome luxury in the world.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She smiled indulgently at the two of them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And if you are very good and Lady Suffolk is very generous, there might occasionally be ice cream for dessert.”</p> <p class="p4">“We cannot have ice cream,” Gregory informed her, “until we are grown.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He delivered it like it was a basic fact of life.</p> <p class="p4">Amelia lifted an eyebrow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Why do you say that?”</p> <p class="p4">“Mother told us,” the boy answered readily.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Ice cream is bad for boys.”</p> <p class="p4">“Father brought some home once, packed in blocks of ice,”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Eustace said, and looked up from the doodle on the margin of his paper.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“He wanted to celebrate: a big investor had signed on to his canal scheme.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His eyes slid to Gregory, and then back to Amelia, expression deadpan.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And Mother explained to us how it was a treat we might get to enjoy… when we were grown.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mother and Father ate it all up that night, since it would not keep.”</p> <p class="p4">Their governess nodded reasonably, and balled up her fist under her skirt so hard it hurt.</p> <p class="p4">She brought the boys back to the house; she sent them to their dinner.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She changed for her own dinner and waited at the adjoining door for Theresa to do the same; she tried as best she could to ogle her half-naked lover properly, but her thoughts kept skipping away.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dinner was quiet and reserved.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Amelia knew better than to trust herself with anything more than minimal conversation with Iris across the table.</p> <p class="p4">By the time dinner was over and her anger had not dissipated, Amelia knew that she was going to have to do something about it, was going to have to have a very strained and complicated conversation with the woman, and so before she disrobed for the evening, she marched her way down the hall to Iris’s door.</p> <p class="p4">You cannot lie to your children, she thought furiously.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They need someone to believe, someone they can trust.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They can not figure out, as Eustace plainly had, that the adults in charge of their very well-being were petty and greedy and willing to lie to cover it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Without a foundation of trust upon which to build their lives, they’d spend their days in mistrust, doubt, cynicism, and, eventually, dissipation.</p> <p class="p4">The door was half-open, with the play of firelight rippling out through the gap.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Amelia rapped on the door smartly.</p> <p class="p4">“Come in,” sang the woman inside gaily, and Amelia pushed inside without registering, in her own anger, the woman’s tone of voice.</p> <p class="p4">She came through the door and there was Iris Sommerset, stretched out across her bed, as naked as the day she had been born.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The lady’s back was to Amelia; without looking behind her, she beckoned with one arm.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She chuckled, low and sultry, and purred, “I’ve been waiting.”</p> <p class="p4">Before Amelia could say anything—or more accurately, before she could turn around and creep right back out the door—that space was filled with the strapping shoulders of a man backing into the room, carrying a tray.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Iris, love, you can’t leave this door quite so open,” he chortled, a touch louder than a whisper.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Else somebody will find out we’re—well hello there.”</p> <p class="p4">Horace, the new coachman, or new Master of the Stable, properly, who wasn’t properly new anymore anyway, had turned around and spied Amelia where she stood without a single idea in her head as to what she should do.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For his part, he hooked the edge of the door behind his heel and swung it shut.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His lips crooked into a delighted little smirk.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Is it the three of us for the evening, then?”</p> <p class="p4">“What are you—holy hell, what are you doing in here?” hissed Iris, who’d turned over and was now glaring daggers at Amelia.</p> <p class="p4">The girl in question put up her hands and directed her eyes at the floor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Excuse me, I’m— so sorry,” she babbled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Iri— I mean, Lady Marbury, I only intended to speak with you about the boys’ education; I knocked, you said come in…”</p> <p class="p4">Horace gestured from Amelia to Iris and back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“So this is not a special surprise for me,” he observed, with no small measure of cheek.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He set the tray on a conveniently near vanity.</p> <p class="p4">“How dare you barge in here,” Iris seethed at her, but it was plainly all bluster.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Amelia dared to glance up and the woman was blushing from top to toes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’ll have you sacked for this!”</p> <p class="p4">“No, milady, I don’t—” Amelia struggled to cut through, for the first time in months having trouble keeping her voice in check.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Finally, she blurted, “Iris, I don’t care.”</p> <p class="p4">That, at least, got the lady to pause.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The fireplace popped and crackled.</p> <p class="p4">Amelia pushed into the silence.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m not going to tell any one,” she said, making eye contact with the naked woman.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I have no interest in telling any one.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Whatever you do, with whoever you do it… I can’t see how it would ever be any of my business.”</p> <p class="p4">“Well that’s refreshing, at least,” Horace remarked, settling onto the chair before the vanity.</p> <p class="p4">But Iris narrowed her eyes at Amelia.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Still standing there and completely unashamed at her nudity, which Amelia would find rather impressive later, when she had regathered her wits.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The lady studied her for a long moment, and then her face relaxed minutely.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Oh, I see.”</p> <p class="p4">“We can talk about the boys tomorrow—”</p> <p class="p4">“You think you’re above all this,” the lady accused.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“The pure-hearted governess, virginal and dedicated to higher purpose.”</p> <p class="p4">A snort forced itself out of Amelia’s nose.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She was hardly virginal, but that was more complicated than she had any interest in explaining here and now.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Milady—”</p> <p class="p4">“You’re lucky, actually,” Iris sighed, and then she was smiling, but the expression in her eyes was sour.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You got to escape the marriage trap.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Nobody told you that you’d have to wed, nobody forced you onto the market, nobody made your whole life dependent on signing your whole life away.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her voice turned sharp and vicious.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Never got fucked, never learned to like it, never needed it when you weren’t supposed to have it anymore.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Got to float above it all.”</p> <p class="p4">“It’s not like that, milady,” the girl assured her, backing towards the door, now.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I am not above anything.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Which is why I have no cause to judge you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The heart wants what it wants,” she said with a gentle shrug.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And you’re not hurting anyone.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She realized she was babbling, and stopped.</p> <p class="p4">Iris just stared at her, uncomprehending.</p> <p class="p4">Amelia found the wall, reached out and opened the door.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Please just… enjoy your evening.”</p> <p class="p4">As she slipped backwards out the door, Horace laughed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Oh, trust me, we will.”</p> <p class="p4">By the time she returned to her own room, her breath was ragged and her forehead slick with worry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Worse, she could feel laughter bubbling up inside her, distinctly at odds with her pounding heart.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She closed her door and leaned up against it, trying and failing to calm herself.</p> <p class="p4">“There you are, Duchess,” Theresa said, stepping through the adjoining door.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She was half-undressed, in stockings and shirtsleeves, comfortable and ready for a quiet evening in.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But the smile on her face dropped as soon as she took in her lover across the room.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Whatever is the matter?”</p> <p class="p4">Amelia shook her head, as if she could simply dismiss the entire encounter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When that didn’t work, she explained, “I just had a… difficult interview with Lady Marbury.”</p> <p class="p4">“About the boys?”</p> <p class="p4">A pale little laugh escaped her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“We didn’t even get to the boys.”</p> <p class="p4">Theresa had crossed the room and took Amelia up in her arms.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Then what?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She’s upset you.”</p> <p class="p4">Amelia let herself fold up against Theresa, grateful for the support and warmth of her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She buried her face in the crook of her lover’s neck and shook her head slightly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s nothing.”</p> <p class="p4">“It’s not nothing if it has my Duchess Regent this agitated,” the woman responded reasonably.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Amelia imagined that she was placidly facing the door, talking to it like a person, while Amelia clutched at her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But the woman didn’t say anything further, content to simply hold her.</p> <p class="p4">It took Amelia some time before she peeled herself back off of her lover.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her face came away damp; she’d been crying into Theresa’s collar, somehow without even realizing it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She was guided to the bed, where she sat down, hands in her lap.</p> <p class="p4">“We had a… confrontation about something else, it’s.. irrelevant,” she started.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She’d told Iris she wouldn’t tell anybody, and she meant to stick by that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“But in the course of it, she said—”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Here her voice crumpled and she had to take a moment to quell the sob that was trying to bubble out of her chest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I swear, Theresa, it is such a silly thing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s nothing.”</p> <p class="p4">Theresa only put one finger under Amelia’s chin and lifted, making calm, steady eye contact from where she stood before her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Tell me.”</p> <p class="p4">And that was it: there was no way that Amelia wasn’t spilling everything, now.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So she took a deep breath to steady herself and said, “She said I was lucky that I’d never marry.”</p> <p class="p4">“Ah,” was all her lover said, although not without sympathy.</p> <p class="p4">“And I want to,” she went on helplessly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Theresa had said to tell her, so she was telling her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was all coming out, now.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I want it so much it hurts, sometimes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am so happy being myself, being Amelia, I can’t even begin to articulate it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But the thought that… becoming me, getting to spend the rest of my life as me, that that has… walled off the possibility of spending the rest of my life with—”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She looked at the floor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“With someone I love.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s too much to even contemplate, sometimes.”</p> <p class="p4">Chesterley squatted before her, her expression built out of weary compassion.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Women like us don’t get that,” she said gravely.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Although the women not like us don’t get the dream of marriage, either, because it’s rarely the safe and loving partnership it’s supposed to be, but.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You don’t need me to rant at you.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She sighed, and said with the weighty air of a inescapable conclusion, “Some things just aren’t for us.”</p> <p class="p4">“Lizzie took me to visit the Ladies of Llangollen,” Amelia said with a pale little smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Have you been?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Have you met them?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When Theresa shook her head, she said, “They’re lovely.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Two ladies in love with each other and with the life they’ve built for themselves.”</p> <p class="p4">“Two noble ladies,” Theresa pointed out gently, “of considerable wealth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That’s not—” She didn’t say it, but it was plain that she was about to say “us.”</p> <p class="p4">“Not as wealthy as all that,” Amelia corrected, shaky with hope.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Were they really talking about what she thought they might be talking about?</p> <p class="p4">But that had been the wrong thing to say.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Wealthier than I am or ever will be,” her lover said, with a new edge to her voice.</p> <p class="p4">“My perspective is biased,” the girl said quickly, apologetically, backing away as fast as she could from the topic that they weren’t talking about, wouldn’t talk about, couldn’t talk about.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And anyway, I have a long history of wanting things that I can’t have, and wanting more than is healthy.”</p> <p class="p4">Theresa took Amelia’s hands in hers and put on a smile, generous and gentle and entirely a choice rather than a window to her own heart.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“We can still find happiness, Amelia.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I promise you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Women like us… we find our own ways, we find our own purpose, we find our own work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And the lives we build may not look like what other people expect a life to look like… but they’re still happy lives.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With purpose.”</p> <p class="p4">Amelia leaned forward, broke Theresa’s hold on her hands, and embraced her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She let herself be comforted, let her tears be wiped away, let herself be taken to bed, and held, and loved.</p> <p>But in the morning, she woke to Theresa quietly packing. They shared light conversation over breakfast, not talking about the night before or the bags packed that morning. In a shadowed nook off the side of the foyer, her lover quickly kissed her goodbye and hastened out the door.</p> <div class="wi_authornotes"> <div> <div class="p-avatar-wrap"><a class="avatar has-link" href="https://scribblehub.com/profile/149271/miriamrobern/"><img id="acc_ava_change profile" alt="" src="https://cdn.scribblehub.com/avatar/s/37/ava_149271_1743989956.jpg"></a></div> <p><span class="an_username"><a href="https://scribblehub.com/profile/149271/miriamrobern/">miriamrobern</a></span></div> <div style="clear: both;"></div> <div class="wi_authornotes_body"> <hr /> <h3>Thanks for Reading!</h3> <p>If you’d like to see more like this, please consider subscribing to my patreon at http://patreon.com/miriamrobern</p> <ul class="ul1"> <li class="li9">I post all chapters a month early for subscribers, so you can read ahead.</li> <li class="li9">I also post epub and pdf versions of the book for everybody.</li> </ul> <p class="p8">Thanks for your support, whether it’s becoming a subscriber or posting comments online.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s people like you who let people like me make stuff like this!</p> </div></div></p> </div>

                <!-- Intentionally not escaping for html context -->
                <div class="chp_raw" id="chp_raw"><p class="p4"><i>Sussex, May 1813</i></p> <p class="p4">The next morning saw the four of them walking out to the stables in their riding gear (or in Theresa’s case, her traveling clothes).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Amelia had been surprised to receive the dowager’s permission to take the boys for a ride, but was quick to take advantage.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Gift horses, etc.</p> <p class="p4">Eustace picked out his favourite steed, a gelding named Trebuchet, whose name was the only thing necessary to secure the boy’s everlasting devotion.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Gregory selected Dapple, which made Amelia happy; the ancient mare would be no challenge for the young equestrian.</p> <p class="p4">She stepped up to King Francis, another long-time resident of the ducal stables with whom Amelia was familiar.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The beast was getting on in years, but he was a well-built specimen who could put on speed if he—or Amelia, chasing one of her charges—needed it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She wondered as she patted his neck if the stallion recognized her at all, or if her scent had changed beyond equine recognition.</p> <p class="p4">Amelia glanced back at Theresa, who had stopped a few steps back, eyeing the horse stalls with trepidation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Perhaps,” her lover said shakily, “I should let the three of you enjoy your ride without me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I fear I should only hold you back.”</p> <p class="p4">“Nonsense,” Amelia insisted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You said you’d give the boys your condensed history of London when we take luncheon up on the summit.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And I’d like to show you the estate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s beautiful.”</p> <p class="p4">“I am not a accomplished horsewoman,” Theresa begged off, although her expression said, “Horses terrify me.”</p> <p class="p4">“Then take Old Dapple,” Gregory offered, and led the grey mare out to where Theresa stood.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Horace says she’s gentle as a lamb.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She won’t give you any trouble.”</p> <p class="p4">“Who’s Horace?”</p> <p class="p4">“The new coachman,” Amelia supplied.</p> <p class="p4">“Properly speaking, I am Master of the Stable,” the man himself corrected her, coming down the shadowed length of his domain.</p> <p class="p4">Amelia tried not to wince.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Horace wasn’t new; he’d been here for months.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>More months than Amelia had been here as governess.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was no plausible reason for her to call him new.</p> <p class="p4">But the horseman did not seem to notice her slip.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was too busy giving Theresa the exact same leer that he had given Amelia on their first meeting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“The late duke wished to cultivate the pedigrees of his stable,” he said as if he were a sommelier discussing wines, “and by all accounts the new duke is also keen on horse breeding.”</p> <p class="p4">Amelia pasted on a smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She’d told Julian that the estate should acquire sufficient broodmares to have at least one of them pregnant at all times.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Eventually, she hoped, the estate would produce its own virus amantis equae, but for now she was reliant on shipments from Uskweirs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She understood how Horace had got from her obscure directions to “keen on horse breeding,” but it was still inaccurate, nor was she “the new duke.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The new duke was presently patting Trebuchet’s nose.</p> <p class="p4">But she was not in a position to correct the swaggering Master of the Stable, so she stayed silent and let him select a horse for her lover.</p> <p class="p4">“Let’s leave Dapple to the young master,” Horace suggested, and gestured Theresa deeper into the stable with a smirk.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She followed with a roll of her eyes seen only by Amelia.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Margaret is nearly as gentle, but twice as robust.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m not sure the boy could straddle her if you took Old Dap.”</p> <p class="p4">The two of them were out of Amelia’s sight when Theresa said sharply, “I require no assistance in mounting, sir.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then a series of grunts and huffs sounded down the stable, followed by Theresa, sitting astride Margaret.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The horse ambled along with a sense of resigned disdain; the Master of the Stable did not bother to follow them out.</p> <p class="p4">Their little riding party followed a well-worn horse trail out from the house and up the gentle incline of the north hills.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mindful that the ride was a reward for Eustace’s cooperation the night before, Amelia refrained from layering lessons on top of the excursion.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Instead, she rode alongside Theresa, splitting her attention between watching the boys ramble ahead and back and keeping an eye on her lover’s tenuous control of her mount.</p> <p class="p4">She pointed out a few of her favourite corners of the estate from her youth; Theresa informed her of the latest careful maneuvers of her bluestocking friends and conspirators.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Childhood reminisces and tales of political stagnation resulted in the both of them repeatedly remarking about how little things ever changed, until it became a joke through repetition.</p> <p class="p4">Finally they crested the last ridge in Amelia’s mental itinerary and the estate spread out before them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The house itself sat like a regal monarch wrapped up in golden fields, emerald groves, and the sapphire sea across the southern horizon.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They stopped to take in the view, and Amelia prompted Eustace to identify the visible points of interest and tenant farmhouses of his future domain.</p> <p class="p4">The boy did so haltingly, until his brother’s corrections tripped his temper and the both of them were growling at each other.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Amelia sent the two of them riding in separate directions, there and back, so they could cool off.</p> <p class="p4">She shrugged to her lover.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Sometimes they’re attentive, sometimes they are distracted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I take what I can get each day.”</p> <p class="p4">But Theresa was paying no attention to the children.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“So this is all yours?” she asked, a little awed as she took in the sprawling estate.</p> <p class="p4">Amelia frowned softly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“This is all the duchy’s. Not mine.”</p> <p class="p4">Theresa gave her a gentle smirk.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You exercise sovereign control over all of this, which we common folk call ownership.”</p> <p class="p4">The boys came thundering back, cheeks pink from the wind, and Amelia called to the elder boy instead of answering.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He turned Trebuchet to face the two ladies, eyebrows raised truculently.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Eustace, dear, can you explain to Miss Chesterley the difference between ownership and stewardship?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Specifically as regards the duke’s relationship to his duchy.”</p> <p class="p4">The boy screwed up his face in a caricature of focus.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Ownership is when you get to decide what to do with a thing for your own purposes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Stewardship is when you decide what to do with a thing—with property, I should have said—when you decide what to do with property for the greater good.”</p> <p class="p4">Amelia bobbed her head in approval.</p> <p class="p4">Seeing his brother getting attention, Gregory sidled in to add, “Cause we belong to the duchy, too.”</p> <p class="p4"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Eustace rolled his eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“That’s not how it goes,” he groaned, and then launched into recitation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“The land belongs to the duchy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And we belong to the duchy, too.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And we work with the land to make sure the duchy is here in the future.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He smiled a beat, and then remembered the rest: “Both for our family, and for all the families that work on or with the duchy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There’s hundreds of people who depend on the duchy,” he told Theresa, “and it’s the duke’s job to make sure they’re taken care of.”</p> <p class="p4">Amelia tried not to preen too obviously at her students’ top-marks answer, as she smiled at Theresa.</p> <p class="p4">“I take it they’re reciting lessons you taught them?” her lover asked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The woman was trying to smirk away the children’s performance, but Amelia was sure she detected a little surprised respect lurking in Theresa’s face.</p> <p class="p4">“They are,” she confirmed with a short, proud nod.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And then the boys decided they were going to have a race to that tree and back, and this time actually asked permission before tearing off towards the horizon.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Amelia granted it and watched them go, more than a little fondly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I don’t own any of this.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I steward it, for Eustace, and for his heirs, and for all the families who live and work here.”</p> <p class="p4">“Ah, so you’re the Duchess Regent,” Theresa observed wryly.</p> <p class="p4">“If such a title existed in England, perhaps,” Amelia allowed, hiding her own smile.</p> <p class="p4">Theresa clumbsily guided her mare to sidestep towards Amelia; the old beast complied only grudgingly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When she was finally close enough to do so, she leaned over and murmured lowly, “So I would not be entirely incorrect if I called you my Duchess… in private.”</p> <p class="p4">The way her lover said the last part sent a shiver down Amelia’s spine, which she had to hide as the boys came riding back in a dead heat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They immediately began arguing over who had won, and were only mollified by Amelia reminding them that she had brought a basket full of sandwiches.</p> <p class="p4">They lunched in a copse of trees just under the breezy summit, on a picnic blanket spread out in the shade.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The two boys devoured their luncheon in what seemed like moments, and Amelia felt guilty asking Theresa to stall her lunch in order to give them her condensed history of London.</p> <p class="p4">But her lover didn’t seem to mind as she rested her half-eaten sandwich on her knee and brushed crumbs from her fingers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Alright.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Tell me, boys, which do you think has the longer, more prestigious history: the English crown, or the City of London?”</p> <p class="p4">The boys responded predictably—nothing could be more prestigious than the English crown—which gave Theresa all the rhetorical leverage she needed to amaze them at how old the city actually was, how it had been built by the Roman Republic, and when Rome fell away it had been kept alive by common men and women, without any help from any king, English or otherwise.</p> <p class="p4">When the kings did appear in Theresa’s retelling, they came as conquerers and raiders; the boys were happy to imagine great battles and sieges.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After each time London changed hands, though, Theresa reiterated that the men and women of London did not change much.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They patched the place up, took care of each other, and kept the city going across centuries.</p> <p class="p4">Amelia, at least, could easily see Theresa’s clear bias for her hard-working commoners over the exploitative kings and their knights.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As the story progressed, she watched the two boys’ reception, wondering how much might sink in.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They had, like many young boys, a tendancy to favor the idea of knights in shining armor over anything else.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Could they even comprehend that the blacksmith who made the armor might be just as interesting, if not more?</p> <p class="p4">No matter whose story was more interesting, the boys’ eyes started glazing over around the time the guilds started losing ground to the banks and factories.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Amelia reached over to touch Theresa’s shoulder and suggested, “Perhaps we can finish the story tomorrow?”</p> <p class="p4">While Theresa finished her lunch, the boys rolled around in the grass.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Amelia watched carefully so that playful wrestling didn’t turn into murderous intent.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I have to admit,” she told her lover idly, “I was expecting a larger emphasis on the roles of women Londoners in your condensed history.”</p> <p class="p4">“The historical record isn’t kind to us,” Chesterley answered with a shrug.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“We have hardly any names of the women who no doubt were there.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You noted, I’m sure, me saying ‘the men and women of London’ at every opportunity.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That’s the best we get.”</p> <p class="p4">Amelia made an agreeable sound.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“A pity.”</p> <p class="p4">Theresa plucked the last sandwich from the platter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s all the same story, though.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The same themes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The same political goals, at the end of the day.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When Amelia asked her to elaborate, she said: “Rights for women requires rights for common folk, because women are common folk.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sometimes even when they’re nobility.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And rights for women requires rights for workers, because all women are workers, even the nobility.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So when I tell the story of London, I tell the story of Londoners cleaning up the mess that the conquering kings and nobles leave behind.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The idea is to wrench the focus away from those in power and onto the common people—all the common people—and understand the story from their perspective.”</p> <p class="p4">Amelia realized she was smiling sappily up at Theresa, and interrupted the smile to say, “And that’s what I wanted the boys to hear.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Oh, the boys.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She darted her attention over to them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They’d rolled a little down the hill, but now seemed intent on watching a snail slide down a log.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Don’t poke the poor thing!” she called down the hill, laughing as Gregory’s hand dropped the stick he’d just picked up.</p> <p class="p4">“Do you think it will matter?” Theresa asked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Amelia looked over to her lover and saw that she, too, was watching the boys.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She elaborated: “Will what you teach these two now stand up to the… torrent of chauvinism they’ll get when they go to school?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She shook her shoulders slightly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I only ask because I never experienced school first-hand.”</p> <p class="p4">“I try not to think about my school days,” Amelia sighed, looking down on the boys.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“They weren’t very positive.”</p> <p class="p4">“My apologies, I shouldn’t have—”</p> <p class="p4">“No, it’s fine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s a good question.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She considered the boys for a long moment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I don’t know if it will work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s certainly not a guaranteed success.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But… in the time that I have them, I’d like to prepare them as best I can.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She looked back to Theresa, trying to force a smile through her own bad memories.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Because it certainly is a… how did you put it?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A ‘torrent of chauvinism?’<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That’s perfectly accurate, functionally, but the… emotional reality is… hellacious.”</p> <p class="p4">“Why put them through it, then?”</p> <p class="p4">“Reasonable question,” she sighed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She could, after all, refuse to pay the tuition; simply accomplished.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And I don’t have a good answer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Because it’s always been done that way?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Because if Eustace takes the title without the network of connections he’ll get at school, he’ll be less capable of stewarding the estate, less likely to find a good match in marriage.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It would be bad for the duchy.”</p> <p class="p4">“Bad for the duchy,” Theresa mused, “but better for him?”</p> <p class="p4">Amelia shook her head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“He’d be plagued his whole life wishing he went to better schools, got in with a better crowd.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ve known society men, titled men, who didn’t go to Eton; they’re kept on the fringes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They spend their lives on the outside looking in.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She took a ragged breath.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I wouldn’t wish that on anyone.”</p> <p class="p4">The ride back down was shorter in absolute terms but felt longer and lazier.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Fatigue had siphoned off the worst of the boys’ impulsiveness and they all let their horses take the lead, watching the landscape pass through what felt like an endless afternoon.</p> <p class="p4">At one point Margaret decided to take Theresa on an unplanned trip down to the creek.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her rider had somehow misplaced her own reins and no amount of kicking or pulling on the horn would stop her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the end, Amelia had to follow after, scoop the reins dangling into the water, and hand them back to her lover.</p> <p class="p4">“I told you I am not an accomplished rider,” the woman sighed.</p> <p class="p4">“That’s all right,” Amelia laughed, and checked that the boys were still up on the horse trail, out of earshot.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Tonight you can ride me.”</p> <p class="p4">“Such scandalous talk from the Duchess Regent!” Theresa grinned in the dappled shade.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And that does sound delicious… although at this point my thighs may be too sore for me to do anything but lie on my back and moan.”</p> <p class="p4">“That can also be arranged,” Amelia winked, and wheeled King Francis around to return to the horse trail.</p> <p class="p4">By the time they returned to the house, the boys were both dragging but Amelia insisted that they seek out their grandmother and thank her for the day’s outing.</p> <p class="p4">Grandmother was in the conservatory, but not alone.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The boys, Amelia, and Theresa trailing behind were already within the green space when the matriarch’s voice cut through the screen of foliage: “The only impressive thing about you, Iris, is your eternal temerity in asking repeatedly for things that I have neither the willingness nor the basic ability to provide you.”</p> <p class="p4">Both boys halted in their tracks; Gregory looked back at Amelia, confusion written across his face.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His governess considered clearing her throat and interrupting what sounded like one of her mother’s thorough dressing-downs, but knew that, once Mother got going, very little could halt her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Instead, she lifted one finger to her lips and nodded back to the doors into the house proper.</p> <p class="p4">“I am trapped!” wailed Iris, also out of sight.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I cannot believe that you do not see or understand my situation, and I will not believe that you are so unfeeling as to disregard it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I have no wish to be a burden on you, milady, but I have no other options unless you provide them.”</p> <p class="p4">Gregory had responded to Amelia’s gesture towards the door, and Theresa gamely collected the boy and bundled him towards the exit.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His elder brother, however, had started creeping deeper into the conservatory, craning his neck to get a better look at whatever was happening.</p> <p class="p4">“I understand your situation perfectly, you vapid little girl,” Mother spat back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I understood it before you were even in it!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Do you not remember I told you that this was exactly where you would end up if you married my son?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That you were not at all the bride that he required, and he would be the worst possible husband for you?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And yet you insisted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You were in love,” she sneered, the expression on her face perfectly plain to Amelia even if she could not see it directly,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“and all sense and forethought be damned in the face of it.”</p> <p class="p4">Amelia quick-stepped after Eustace, praying that her riding boots would tread quietly on the flagstones.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The boy was nearly at the bend of the path that would bring him into view, and did not seem to be slowing his steps at all.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With a quiet huff, Amelia lunged forward to wrap one arm around his middle and clamp her opposite hand over his mouth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She hauled the boy backwards, clutching him up against her body and staggering, as quietly as she could manage, towards the door.</p> <p class="p4">“Forgive me if I did not believe your powers of prophecy,” Iris hissed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I didn’t understand, then, that you personally make sure they come to pass.”</p> <p class="p4">“I’m sure I have no idea—”</p> <p class="p4">But the Lady Marbury refused to back down. “When he courted me, Eustace insisted we need not have children, that we could live on the Continent, that we could leave all this nonsense behind.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But then you whispered in his ear about his solemn duties and you cut his allowance and—”</p> <p class="p4">Amelia shoved Eustace the Younger through the door and then made sure it closed quietly behind them.</p> <p class="p4">Theresa and Gregory were waiting outside, the little boy’s eyes wide as saucers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Is Mama in trouble?” he asked Amelia, in the kind of tone that suggested he’d already asked Theresa and got no answer.</p> <p class="p4">“Your mother and your grandmother are having an adult conversation,” Amelia whispered, even if the door behind them was closed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And while we did not intend to overhear it, it is rude to eavesdrop any further.”</p> <p class="p4">Eustace crossed the hall to drop onto a mahogany bench opposite the conservatory door.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“They hate each other.”</p> <p class="p4">Looking from the boys to Theresa and back, Amelia groped for something that she could say.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Something that the newly-arrived governess would know to say.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Something that would help the boys understand how adults sometimes talked to each other.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Something that was, if it was even reasonable to hope for, actually true.</p> <p class="p4">Finally she sighed and said, “Remember, they’re both in mourning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s difficult to lose your loved ones, especially the loved ones you depend on.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Which I think you both understand, possibly better than I.”</p> <p class="p4">The boys made no answer to that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A few moments later, Gregory crossed from Theresa’s side to sit next to Eustace and quietly took the older boy’s hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His brother did not protest; a moment later he squeezed it.</p> <p class="p4">Amelia prompted the boys to go wash up before their suppers and watched them walk out of earshot before heaving a sigh.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m sorry you had to hear all that.”</p> <p class="p4">“Families are complicated,” Theresa answered with a shrug.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You should have seen the rows my family had.”</p> <p class="p4">“I thought you were raised by bluestockings?”</p> <p class="p4">“There’s nothing bluestockings love more than arguing,” Theresa replied with a wan smile. She then collected Amelia’s hand and pulled her down the hall, towards their rooms and away from the conservatory. “We should wash up before our suppers, too. Would it be gauche of me to say I’m looking foward to the table conversation?”</p> <div class="wi_authornotes"> <div> <div class="p-avatar-wrap"><a class="avatar has-link" href="https://scribblehub.com/profile/149271/miriamrobern/"><img id="acc_ava_change profile" alt="" src="https://cdn.scribblehub.com/avatar/s/37/ava_149271_1743989956.jpg"></a></div> <p><span class="an_username"><a href="https://scribblehub.com/profile/149271/miriamrobern/">miriamrobern</a></span></div> <div style="clear: both;"></div> <div class="wi_authornotes_body"> <hr /> <h3>Thanks for Reading!</h3> <p class="p8">If you’d like to see more like this, please consider subscribing to my patreon at http://patreon.com/miriamrobern</p> <ul class="ul1"> <li class="li9">I post all chapters a month early for subscribers, so you can read ahead.</li> <li class="li9">I also post epub and pdf versions of the book for everybody.</li> </ul> <p class="p8">Thanks for your support, whether it’s becoming a subscriber or posting comments online.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s people like you who let people like me make stuff like this!</p> </div></div></p> </div>

                <div class="chp_raw" id="chp_raw"><p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">Sammy, you have to text me when you get home from a date!</span></strong><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rowan’s message was waiting on his phone when Sammy woke up the next morning.</p> <p class="p4"><strong>How do you know if it was really a date?</strong> <span class="s2"> he texted back, bleary-eyed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></span><strong>I never told you how that shook out.</strong></p> <p class="p4"><strong>It was always a fucking date.</strong></p> <p class="p4"><strong>The only question was if you’d realize it.</strong></p> <p class="p4"><strong>Before you were like a dozen ‘apology dinners’ in and they fucking proposed or something.</strong></p> <p class="p2">Sammy wasn’t particularly happy with how accurate that sounded.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><strong><span class="s1">Im home, im safe</span>,</strong> he texted back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><strong><span class="s1">Finn was a perfect gentlethem.</span></strong></p> <p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">Did you put out? </span></strong>she shot back, followed after a moment with a winky face.</p> <p class="p2">Sammy rolled his eyes and did not dignify his cousin’s question with any response.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Instead he pushed himself out of bed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He needed to get up and moving.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He had so much reading to do this weekend.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But a moment later, smirking in sudden perverse inspiration, he dove back to grab his phone and texted Rowan:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><strong><span class="s1">Good girls don’t kiss and tell.</span></strong></p> <p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">Who the fuck wants to be a good girl?</span></strong> was the—in retrospect—inevitable reply.</p> <p class="p2">Grinning, Sammy shook his head as he packed his bag to straining with all the books he needed for the day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The dining commons was a short walk away, and held the promise of waffles and bacon to wake him up and endless soda refills to keep him that way.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Twenty minutes later—he was getting quick at simple makeup looks—his study materials were spread out across a table towards the back of the room, along with a tray bearing two plates of food.</p> <p class="p2">He took his time with breakfast, but his eyes kept wandering to the stacks of books around him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’d like to start with something light, but… he wasn’t sure any of it qualified.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The same went for “something he was comfortable with.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Everything in this program was a push for him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Everything was uphill.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Everything was so much effort.</p> <p class="p2">Why couldn’t it be easy just once, he sighed… like the date last night. Sure, he’d had butterflies like whoa and the start had been a little rocky, but once he got over himself—and really, that had mostly been him making it harder than it ever had to be, right?—the rest of the evening had been… effortless.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Comfortable.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Finn had really gone out of their way to put Sammy at ease, and that was, apparently, exactly what he’d needed.</p> <p class="p2">His eggs had gone cold.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sammy realized with a start that he’d been sitting there, picking at his breakfast and staring off into space, running back and forth through the date.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He rolled his shoulders, set aside his half-eaten food, and picked up whatever book was on top.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He had reading to do.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was going to read.</p> <p class="p2"><i>Sir Walter Elliot, of Kellnych Hall, in Somersetshire, was a man who, for his own amusement, never took up any book but the Baronetage; there he found…</i> wow, that was a lot of commas.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And what the heck was <i>the Baronetage</i>?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Scowling, Sammy pulled out his phone and searched.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Apparently it was… a bunch of English nobles?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But this seemed to think it was some sort of book.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He pressed on—the opening sentence just kept going on and on, taking up almost the whole first paragraph—and apparently, okay.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a book that listed out all the English nobles?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Maybe.</p> <p class="p2">Sammy sighed and settled back into his seat, reading about this dude and his daughters and his dead wife and his big house in England.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was just about to get sick of it all, and especially this rich fucker, when he hit <i>Vanity was the beginning and the end of Sir Walter Elliot’s character,</i> and he actually snorted out loud.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Okay.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So he wasn’t actually supposed to respect this guy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He could do that.</p> <p class="p2">But then the book started going on about his dead wife, and Sammy struggled to keep his attention on the details.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By the time he got to the dead wife’s friend and the noble guy’s daughter that nobody liked except the dead wife’s friend, Sammy realized that he was thinking as much about sharing bites of ice cream with Finley than he was about this girl who was apparently exceedingly boring.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He closed his eyes for a moment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He set the book down.</p> <p class="p2">Okay.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This was just not the best choice for a good start.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He traded <i>Persuasion</i> for <i>Intro to Biological Systems</i> and dug into the third chapter (the class had skipped the first chapter and covered the second already).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But no sooner had he hit something that he remembered from class—radial symmetry—than Sammy also remembered how Finley had laughed when the professor had made a joke about octopuses telling left from right.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And then he was thinking about Finley laughing on their date, and how Finley’s laugh was low and warm and—</p> <p class="p2">Fuck.</p> <p class="p2">He set <i>Biological Systems</i> aside and picked up something else.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And then something else.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And another thing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No matter what the subject matter was, all Sammy could think about, apparently, was his date last night and how Finley had… wanted him to be there, wanted to be there with him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And how they were so pretty, especially when they smiled.</p> <p class="p2">And when Finley smiled at Sammy, and it was like Sammy was the only thing in the world, and—</p> <p class="p2">Finally Sammy pushed a book titled—no lie—<i>Feminism is for Everybody</i> to the side and picked up his phone.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His text history with Rowan was still at the top of his screen. <strong><span class="s1">Hey advice?</span></strong> he tapped out. <strong><span class="s1">I’m supposed to wait, right, before like talking to Finn? After the date? Don’t want to come on too strong or whatever.</span></strong></p> <p class="p2">Rowan didn’t respond for almost half an hour, and Sammy was pushing himself through covalent bonds when his phone finally chimed with her advice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><strong><span class="s1">That’s cishet bullshit.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Do what feels right, Sammy.</span></strong></p> <p class="p2">She went on, at length, in a series of texts that read a lot like the History reading that Sammy wasn’t doing, which wasn’t a surprise since it was her father that had assigned said reading.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A whole lot about the precarity of heterosexual courtship customs and negotiating through unequal power dynamics and so on.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With a healthy dollop of Rowan on top: those poor cishet girls, trapped in a situation where they couldn’t just be themselves and be loved for being themselves.</p> <p class="p2">Sammy sent back short, agreeable texts as she ranted, and then switched over to his text chain with Finley.</p> <p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">I really enjoyed last night.</span></strong><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He smiled down at his phone as he hit Send.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It felt silly how happy it made him just saying how he was feeling, but then that was how the whole date had gone last night, too.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Easy and comfortable.</p> <p class="p2">It was only a few minutes before Finley replied.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sammy had tried to go back to his reading, which wasn’t working, but he smiled again when he saw the response:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><strong><span class="s1">I did, too. &lt;3</span></strong></p> <p class="p4"><span class="s2">He picked up his phone and settled back in his chair.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></span><strong>I’m sitting here trying to study but my brain keeps going back to last night and your smile</strong></p> <p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">And that kiss,</span></strong> he added, with a touch more honesty, a moment later.</p> <p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">And your butt,</span></strong> he thought but did not commit to SMS.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Holding back a little might be a good idea, actually.</p> <p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong>Sounds like I did a good job,</strong> then,</span> Finley responded, along with a two-second video of Bugs Bunny bowing on a stage while getting showered with roses from the audience.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><strong><span class="s1">Good first date?</span></strong></p> <p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">Good first date,</span></strong> he confirmed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He stared at the short, bare text for a long moment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That wasn’t enough.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sammy screwed up his lips and tapped out: <strong><span class="s1">But practice makes perfect, right?</span></strong></p> <p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">I have heard this,</span></strong> came back Finley’s reply, which seemed… curiously cagey.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When no bouncing dots followed, Sammy frowned down at his phone.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Now what?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Had they been distracted by some other thing?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Was there nothing else to say?</p> <p class="p2">Notifications of Rowan’s continuing tirade kept trying to distract him from the suddenly anemic-feeling exchange with Finn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><i>Do what feels right,</i> she’d said.</p> <p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">You wanna do it again?</span></strong> he typed out, but then frowned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Too passive, too indirect.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Too much… implying that he’d be amenable to them asking him out.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And hadn’t Finn suggested, early on yesterday, that Sammy might do the asking for next date?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sammy deleted his unsent text, and instead typed out <strong><span class="s1">May I take you out sometime?</span></strong> and hit Send before he could think better of it.</p> <p class="p2">The response was immediate:<strong> <span class="s1">I’d like that a lot. :D</span></strong></p> <p class="p2">The timing strongly implied that they hadn’t been distracted by some other thing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sammy imagined for a moment Finley hunched suspensefully over their phone, just like he was with his.</p> <p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">Friday?</span></strong> he asked.</p> <p class="p4"><strong>It’s a date.</strong></p> <p class="p2">They didn’t text any further, and Sammy turned back to his stack of books, head a little clearer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Just touching base with Finn and setting up another date alleviated the pressure of what had happened yesterday and the question if it would ever happen again.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It <i>would</i> happen again.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On Friday.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And as much as he was looking forward to it, Sammy felt a growing sense of peace.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Before he knew it, Sammy was almost a quarter of the way into <i>Persuasion</i> and it was 11 o’clock.</p> <p class="p2">Eleven meant the grill was open, so Sammy finished a chapter, set down his book, and wandered over to his new and neverending source of cheeseburgers.</p> <p class="p2">Sammy waited his turn behind a couple frat boys, poking at his phone to catch up on Rowan’s diatribe on cishet dating practices.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She’d apparently wound down eventually, and he felt a little bad about ignoring her in favour of texting Finley and then—worse—schoolwork.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He threw in a few laugh reacts and a silly joke to show that he had read what she’d texted.</p> <p class="p2">“What can I get you, chica?” asked the guy behind the grill, with the sort of tone that told Sammy that he’d been staring at his phone instead of ordering for a bit too long.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The frat boys ahead of him were walking away with their food.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But the grill guy was smiling, with a little conspiratorial gleam to his eye.</p> <p class="p2">There were two possible explanations for that look, and Sammy wasn’t sure which it was.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The guy was brown, too, and so maybe it was a look of camaraderie here among all the white folks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or possibly he liked how Sammy looked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The casual ribbed tank that Sammy had pulled on this morning did display a whole bunch of fake cleavage.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or there was the distinct possibility it was both.</p> <p class="p2">Sammy struggled to parse the many connotations and inflections of “chica” here in the City.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s not like he ever got called that back at home.</p> <p class="p2">But he had to order, so he lowered his phone and stepped forward.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Sorry, uh, just a cheeseburger, please.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Oh, um.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With bacon.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Because you could just do that here, and it didn’t even cost extra.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>College was awesome.</p> <p class="p2">But the grill guy only blinked, dumbfounded, in response.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A beat later, he nodded forcefully.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Yeah, of course.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Coming right up.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And he busied himself with the grill, not looking up.</p> <p class="p2">The fuck was that?</p> <p class="p2">“Oh hey.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Samantha, right?’ The student next in line had stepped up to put in his order and spotted Sammy.</p> <p class="p2">“And you’re Leon,” he said with a nod, pulling his attention away from the grill guy’s weird reaction.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“From Ukraine.”</p> <p class="p2">“That’s me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One cheeseburger, please,” he sent over the grill counter with a curt smile and nod.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then they both sidestepped along the curve of the grill station to wait for their orders to be prepared.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“How is your Saturday treating you?” asked Leon.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Finally the weekend.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No classes.”</p> <p class="p2">“No classes, but a lot of reading,” Sammy chuckled mirthlessly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He tipped his head to the back of the room.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’ve sort of taken over a table to just power through it all.”</p> <p class="p2">“Ah yes, Jane Austen and bell hooks,” the Ukrainian nodded.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Quite a combination.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Do you ever wonder if the teachers think about how the books they assign contrast with each other?”</p> <p class="p2">“Bilateral symmetry and covalent bonds,” Sammy joked, and tried to demonstrate both with the same gesture, the fingers of each hand splayed and wiggling at each other.</p> <p class="p2">“Ta!” Leon chortled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Yes, exactly.”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy leaned against the counter, back to the grill.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Leon was tall, and tipping himself back a little to increase the difference in their heights gave Sammy a little flutter in his belly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Silly, but still fun.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“What’s giving you the most trouble?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I can’t even decide, between all six.”</p> <p class="p2">“Oh, the Austen,” the young man from Ukraine answered readily.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And I am reticent about the Composition work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am not so comfortable with the vagaries of the English language, you know?”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy nodded, pretending that he, a native English speaker, absolutely knew what ‘vagaries’ meant.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Not the science and math stuff?”</p> <p class="p2">Leon waved a hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Science is science, math is math.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The hardest part about the Bio and Physics classes is learning the new names for things.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Otherwise, it is all the same phenomena under the surface.”</p> <p class="p2">“Yeah, I can see how that could be for you,” Sammy responded awkwardly, thinking: did the Marginalized Scholars program just import foreign geniuses and then lumped him in with them?</p> <p class="p2">“Your cheeseburger, sir,” said the grill guy as he desposited a plate on the edge of the counter beside Sammy.</p> <p class="p2">Leon frowned softly as he lifted the top bun of the burger, and then shook his head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“This is not mine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It has bacon on it.”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy turned just in time to see grill guy point at him with his spatula.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“No, it’s his.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The emphasis he put on the last word made clear how intentional the word choice was.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His eyes flicked towards Sammy but wouldn’t meet his eye.</p> <p class="p2">Leon drew himself up to his full height, expression stormy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Sir, my friend Samantha’s pronouns are she and her.”</p> <p class="p2">Grill guy put up his hands as if to say, “How was I to know?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And then busied himself plating Leon’s burger with no bacon.</p> <p class="p2">For his part, Sammy collected his bacon cheeseburger and left the grill behind, not rushing but not not rushing, either.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He wasn’t upset like he imagined Rowan or a real trans girl might be upset, but the barb still rankled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He hadn’t been misidentified, after all.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But he had put effort into how he looked, even for a study day in the dining commons, and having all of that ignored was… frustrating.</p> <p class="p2">And the curl of the guy’s lip when he said what he said was so plainly hostile, and over so little.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Because, what, he thought “I’ll low-key flirt with this chica,” and then discovered his own homophobia?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What a dick.</p> <p class="p2">Leon caught up halfway to Sammy’s table.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“That man is… augh,” he growled, and said something in Ukrainian, with significant emphasis.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I cannot remember the English.”</p> <p class="p2">Despite his own frustration at the grill guy, Sammy couldn’t help but smirk at Leon’s considerably more voluable anger.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“There are so many options in English.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Easiest is just to say he was being a dick.”</p> <p class="p2">“Ah, yes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>‘Dick.’” Leon nodded, and then coughed, coloured, and looked sidelong at Sammy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Sorry if that is inappropriate language for… men speaking to girls.”</p> <p class="p2">“Maybe in <i>Persuasion</i>, but it’s okay here,” he told Leon, and then his table and all his books was in front of them both.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He paused only a moment before inviting Leon to join.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m kind of dug in for the day, but I can move some things if you want to sit?”</p> <p class="p2">“Thank you,” he responded, sat down, and tucked in.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They talked sporadically about the reading—it was all spread out before them, after all—and their classes and professors, but neither mentioned the grill guy again.</p> <p class="p2">He had been thinking about it ever since he saw it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’d gone back and forth on the idea all week.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was hesitant to spend the money, and he wasn’t sure it would be all that useful, but the thought of it, the idea of it, the promise of it, ate away at his brain.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What if it helped?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was so much happening in his brain right now and maybe this was the thing that would make all of it settle down and form up into rows or whatever was inside the heads of people better put together than he was.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And if it didn’t do anything for him, well then, it wasn’t that much of a waste, right?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was here to try new things, after all.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So maybe, possibly, he should give it a try?</p> <p class="p2">But when he went to go take one more look, he got ambushed by the stupidest consideration yet.</p> <p class="p2">Here he was in the campus gift shop, standing before the display of day planners.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He knew which format he wanted, with the six sections of graph paper and the integrated calendar.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The problem, the stupidest consideration, the hiccup that he couldn’t believe was actually stalling him, was that they only had two colours: a very sickly-looking olive green and a bright magenta.</p> <p class="p2">No, it wasn’t magenta.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was pink.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dark pink, but… pink.</p> <p class="p2">“You have half a dozen pieces of clothing that are that exact colour,” he growled at himself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And the green is… terrible.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There’s a reason there’s a dozen of those left over after the real school year, because nobody in their right mind could want to see that every day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And there’s one pink one left because the rest of them were snatched up, because it’s…”</p> <p class="p2">He couldn’t bring himself to say, “it’s a nice colour” even under his breath.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And that, in turn, pissed him off even more.</p> <p class="p2">It wasn’t even a contest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He wanted the pink day planner.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So why couldn’t he pick it up?</p> <p class="p2">He wore that colour all the time—and the thought of his day planner matching his outfit was appealing, too—but the pink clothes were part of his costume, the act, the ridiculous farce that he’d fallen into backwards, pretending to be a trans girl so that he could go to school in the City.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That was all necessary (if absurd).</p> <p class="p2">Picking out a pink day planner for himself was a whole different thing.</p> <p class="p2">“Boys can like pink, too,” he admonished himself, low enough that nobody could hear, because how would he explain that?</p> <p class="p2">Oh fuck, did he like pink?</p> <p class="p2">His traitorous brain immediately supplied him a list of colours he liked: pink and white and mint green, scarlet but not burgundy; sometimes blue but only very specific blues, and black when used as an accent colour.</p> <p class="p2">He very nearly swore aloud at his brain in the gift store aisle.</p> <p class="p2">Sammy forced himself to pick up the olive green planner.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He opened it: six sections, graph paper, the clever calendar.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This was what he needed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The question was utility, not looks, and he’d be looking at it open more often than closed, anyway.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He snapped it shut and immediately flinched at the cover.</p> <p class="p2">“It’s like vomit,” he despaired.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He wanted to put it down.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He didn’t want to even touch this thing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Which would, some corner of his brain chimed in, make it hard to use the thing as much as he wanted to.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With a sigh, he put it back on the shelf and looked over at the pink one.</p> <p class="p2">He knew if he picked it up, he wouldn’t put it down.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There wasn’t going to be a decision process after it was in his hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The decision was right now.</p> <p class="p2">Someone was coming up the aisle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Was she looking at the pink planner?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sammy snapped it up before she could get close.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She walked right past.</p> <p class="p2">He looked down at the pink planner.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yeah.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’d been right.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Now that it was in his hand, he knew he’d be buying it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“What am I going to do next, go buy some pens with pink ink?” he grumbled at himself, and studiously ignored the part of his brain that perked up at the suggestion.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Just the planner.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m only getting the planner.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I already have pens.”</p> <p class="p2">Fuming, he took the planner to the front of the store and set it down on the checkout counter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And there, in front of the cash register, was a display of Columbia-branded pens.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most of them were blue; a handful of them were baby pink.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Behind those was a hand-lettered sign reading “Yes, we write pink!”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The letters were, predictably, inked in pink, and a rather fetching shade, too.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was like the world was conspiring against him.</p> <p class="p2">He grabbed two pink pens and slapped them on top of the planner.</p> <p class="p2">It was late Sunday afternoon when Sammy, freshly showered and shaved, dressed and made up, received a video call request from his mother.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He looked from his phone to the vanity mirror affixed to his chest of drawers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Fuck,” he muttered at his femme-as-hell reflection.</p> <p class="p2">He thumbed Audio Only.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Hey mom!”</p> <p class="p2">“Is your video camera not working, honey?” was his mother’s first quetion.</p> <p class="p2">“No, it’s working fine,” he squawked, scrambling for something plausible.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m just… uh, you caught me just as I got back from the shower.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He looked in the mirror at his outfit.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m naked.”</p> <p class="p2">“Well that’s nothing I haven’t seen before!”</p> <p class="p2">He lifted an eyebrow at his reflection and did not say, “Trust me, you’ve never seen this.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Instead he made a strangled, awkward sound.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Mom…”</p> <p class="p2">“Okay, okay,” she relented.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I can press my phone up against my head like it’s 2007 or something.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She huffed a mock-aggreived sigh and said, “I just wanted to check up on you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>See your face, but I can make do with hearing your voice.”</p> <p class="p2">“It’s good to hear your voice, too,” he said, a little too automatically.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“That is.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sorry, I’ve been super busy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I should have called earlier.”</p> <p class="p2">“Honey, it’s only been a week.”</p> <p class="p2">He laughed out loud.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Has it really?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Holy shit, you’re right.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Like I said, I’ve been… super busy.”</p> <p class="p2">“I’d love to hear about it, honey.”</p> <p class="p2">He couldn’t help smiling a little at his mother’s voice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And I’d love to tell you.”</p> <p class="p2">So they talked about his classes and his dorm room, about if he’d seen any of the city—“not much, I’ve mostly stayed on campus”—and the Roth-Masters, who his mother had never even met face-to-face.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When all the basics were covered, his mother asked, “Well, anything else exciting to report, honey?”</p> <p class="p2">There were so many ways to answer that question, he mused, looking down into his cleavage.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Before he’d actually decided how to hedge, he heard himself saying, “Okay, so don’t freak out about this, but… I went on a date.”</p> <p class="p2">“Oh!” she gasped, more than a little surprised.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“That’s excellent. I mean, I hope it was excellent.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What’s your date’s name?”</p> <p class="p2">“Finley,” he said, intently aware of how his giddy smile was plainly audible.</p> <p class="p2">“And Finley is…?” she asked, trailing off expentantly.</p> <p class="p2">“A pre-med student,” Sammy answered immediately<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He couldn’t help but grin at his mother’s leading question.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He knew exactly what she was angling for: is ‘Finley’ a boy or a girl, child of mine who started attending GSA meetings and never gave your loving, supportive parents the honor of coming out to them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He decided to toy with her.</p> <p class="p2">“Oh, that wasn’t exactly what I—”</p> <p class="p2">“Oh, right, of course,” Sammy nodded, even though she couldn’t see him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Finley is—” Half a beat. “—Puerto Rican.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Finley Aceves.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>From Nebraska, of all places.”</p> <p class="p2">“Oh wow, a real out-of-towner,” she laughed, the sound coming across a little frayed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Was it the connection or maternal frustration?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“But Finley is…”</p> <p class="p2">“…really fun,” he finished for her, and couldn’t help but giggle.</p> <p class="p2">“Okay, now you’re just fucking with me,” she laughed, and he laughed along with her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It felt good; suddenly he missed her fiercely.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They used to laugh like this all the time.</p> <p class="p2">“Finley is genderqueer,” he finally relented.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Pronouns they and them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And they are… amazing, and they make me feel amazing.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He found himself plopping down on his bed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And yeah, the date was excellent.”</p> <p class="p2">“What did you do?” she wanted to know, and so he told her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or at least he told her a very carefully editted version, without any of the discussion about the importance of passing or shouted transphobia on the street.</p> <p class="p2">To her credit, his mother only stumbled on Finley’s pronouns once, and didn’t seem even vaguely discomfitted at the idea of her son dating a genderqueer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m so glad you got such a good first date experience,” she enthused.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Mine was… less so.”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy’s eyebrows rose.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His mom had always been cagey about her past, which he’d chalked up to her being Not From Around Here in Oak Grove, and not having the same bank of shared stories as all the natives.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“What was yours like?”</p> <p class="p2">“Oh gosh, it was so pedestrian,” his mother laughed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Dinner and a movie.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But I was trying so hard.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I overdressed and looked ridiculous for what should have been a very casual thing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And the movie I picked was nothing she was actually interested in.”</p> <p class="p2">The pronoun did not escape Sammy’s notice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mom’s first date was with a girl?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Watching family movies together, his mother always talked about how beautiful and sexy the female stars were, but he’d always thought she was doing it to wind up his father.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But she’d been queer this whole time?</p> <p class="p2">“Sounds extremely awkward,” he said, just to keep her going.</p> <p class="p2">“Oh, it was.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I still cringe when I think about it,” his mother laughed down the line.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“But somehow, despite all that, Amy agreed to go on a second date with me, and a third.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We were together for a little more than a year.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ancient history, now.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I met your father the next year, and that was that.”</p> <p class="p2">“…is Dad home?”</p> <p class="p2">“No, he’s in Dover,” she answered with a sigh.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I hate when he works weekends, but apparently this client couldn’t meet any other time, so.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is what it is.”</p> <p class="p2">“Next time, then,” he shrugged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Actually.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Why don’t we set aside a day and a time to call every week?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sundays work for me, I’ll enjoy a break from studying all weekend.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And if he knew when the call was going to happen, he could scrub off his makeup beforehand and throw on a hoodie.</p> <p class="p2">“That sounds like a fabulous idea,” she responded eagerly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Same time I called today, like three pm?”</p> <p class="p2">The time did strike Sammy as a little odd, given his mother’s usually industrious weekend schedule.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And then he realized what must have happened.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“After church with your parents?” he smirked.</p> <p class="p2">“Guilty as charged,” his mother laughed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Or redeemed as charged, maybe.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But yes, I went to church today, because Richard left for Dover early and the house was too damn quiet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So I called your grandparents and tagged along like old times.”</p> <p class="p2">“Gramma must have been ecstatic.”</p> <p class="p2">“Oh, she was,” she answered ruefully.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Gave me the hard sell on making it a regular thing again.”</p> <p class="p2">“Will you?” he asked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His father had never been big on church attendance, which had given Sammy cover to opt out, excepting of course for Christmas and Easter and the odd First Communion of a cousin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’d never understood the Levchenko attraction to their little mountain church, or his mother’s ambivalence.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When he was small, she’d taken him to Sunday school every week.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’d played and listened to stories in the Little Kids classroom; she taught in the Big Kids class.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And then they didn’t anymore.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He never went to Big Kids Sunday school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That must have been when he’d been old enough to opt out.</p> <p class="p2">“I don’t know,” she demurred.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“That place is full of memories, good and bad.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lots of good ones, though.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sammy mouthed the words even as she said them over the phone: “Your father and I got married there.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was what she always said about the church.</p> <p class="p2">“One day you’ll have to show me pictures,” he teased.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I don’t think I’ve ever seen photographic evidence.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He had, in fact, lost count of the number of times they’d gone through her wedding album on the couch.</p> <p class="p2">“Just for that, I’m going to start texting you a new photo every hour,” she mock-warned, and then her voice shifted to musing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You know, I keep meaning to digitize that album…”</p> <p class="p2">“Yeah, you have fun with that, mom,” he told her, standing up off his bed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’d spotted the time on his laptop screen; it was an hour later than he’d thought it was.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I actually have to run.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Roth-Masters invited me over for dinner.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Everybody keeps warning me that I’ll realize the dining commons is crap and then they try to lure me away with food from elsewhere.”</p> <p class="p2">“Is the dining commons crap?” she asked, suddenly concerned.</p> <p class="p2">“No, it’s good.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I can get a bacon cheeseburger fresh off the grill every day for lunch and for dinner,” he bragged, knowing she’d be cringing on the other end of the line.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Before she could tell him to eat a more balanced diet, he added, “But I don’t.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There’s loads of steamed veggies all the time, and a salad bar that’s… honestly pretty good.”</p> <p class="p2">He crossed the room to step into his flats while his mother expressed her relief and then still admonished him to eat better.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He unhooked his little white purse from its hook by the door and wandered around the room, collecting his wallet and keys and lippy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Mom, mom.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mom, I really do need to go.”</p> <p class="p2">“Okay, fine,” she pouted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You get dressed and go.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am mollified only because we’re going talk next week, with video, yeah?”</p> <p class="p2">“With video,” he agreed indulgently.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I love you, mom.”</p> <p class="p2">“Love you too, pumpkin.”</p> <p class="p2">Finley texted Sammy while he was on the subway to the Roth-Masters, asking <span class="s1">Do I get to know what we’re doing on Friday?</span></p> <p class="p2"><span class="s1">It’s a surprise,</span> Sammy texted back, since he had no idea what, exactly, he was going to do for the date.</p> <p class="p2">Finley sent back a gif of Frodo Baggins telling Gandalf to keep his secrets. Sammy giggled and sat back in his seat as the subway train rumbled along.</p> <p class="p2">He really should figure out where he could take Finley.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’d never taken anybody on a date before, so he didn’t know where to begin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He certainly didn’t want to make it something boring, the dinner-and-a-movie that his mom regretted doing.</p> <p class="p2">Although, he mused, the fact that Finley had put an expiration date on whatever they were doing might have some advantages.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was going nowhere, at the end of the day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or the end of the summer, as it were.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Finley would fly off to California and Sammy would stay in New York (whether he made it into Columbia or not; he’d work retail and share an apartment six ways if he had to).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So in a lot of ways, if (and when) Sammy screwed up, he wouldn’t have to deal with the consequences.</p> <p class="p2">He scowled across the subway car.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That sounded callous.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He certainly didn’t want to do anything that would hurt Finley.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He wasn’t going to be an asshole.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But he could… experiment a little?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Try things out.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Which is what he was going to have to do anyway, since this was his first… he balked at calling whatever they had ‘a relationship’ but whatever word you were supposed to use before it was a relationship, that thing.</p> <p class="p2">This was his first whatever-this-is, and therefore he was going to have to experiment and try things out and feel his way through how it worked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But whatever he knocked over in his fumbling around in the dark, whatever mistakes he made, would all fly away to California in seven weeks.</p> <p class="p2">He didn’t have to worry, like all the kids in high school always worried, about what if this was the relationship that they settled down with for the rest of their lives, or what if they broke up but then neither of them left Oak Grove and they ended up neighbours and attending PTA meetings together, and wouldn’t that be awkward.</p> <p class="p2">It was kind of liberating.</p> <p class="p2">He didn’t want to call this a practice relationship, but let’s be honest, it kind of was going to end up being a practice relationship, anyway.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Assuming it became an actual relationship.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He should ask Rowan where the dividing line on that one was; he was pretty sure neither he nor Finley even owned a letterman jacket that they other could wear around campus to make things official.</p> <p class="p2">And after Finley flew off to the rest of their life, Sammy’s “detransition” wouldn’t upset them, at least not directly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One less person’s feelings to worry about, since he was certain by now that Rowan was going to take it hard.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She’d say she wasn’t disappointed and she’d try and be supportive, but it was going to be an act, and a painful one at that.</p> <p class="p2">Sammy shook his head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He didn’t like to think about that, even if it was inevitable.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What would happen would happen.</p> <p class="p2">And with Finley, what would happen would happen <i>in California</i>, which took a load off Sammy’s mind.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He could throw caution to the wind, practice having a relationship, and just enjoy what time he and Finley got to have together.</p> <p class="p2">It was perfect.</p> <p class="p2">“Samantha!” cried Gideon as he opened the front door.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s been so long!”</p> <p class="p2">“Friday,” he corrected needlessly as he stepped inside and hugged his uncle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“We had class on Friday.”</p> <p class="p2">“Yes, but I don’t get hugs in class, so this is plainly superior.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He offered to take Sammy’s cardigan, which had been doffed and folded over Sammy’s forearm almost immediately after coming up out of the subway.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The city was hot and muggy; Sammy wasn’t sure why he’d worn it at all, outside of how it completed the outfit.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was only too glad to hand it over.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Gideon opened the hall closet and gestured him further inside.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Henry and Rowan are eager to see you.”</p> <p class="p2">He didn’t even make it to the dining room before Rowan crash-hugged into him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Oooo, Sammy, it’s so good seeing you not on a screen!”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She held him out at arm’s length for scrutiny.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And you’re looking good, bitch!”</p> <p class="p2">He couldn’t help but smile at the compliment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He had been embarassed to realize this afternoon that he had dressed for Rowan’s approval.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Having now secured it, he blushed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Thanks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was a cardigan, too, but it was just too damn hot.”</p> <p class="p2">“You’re too damn hot,” she teased, and took his hand to drag him into the dining room.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Summer’s hard to dress for, because mostly it’s just skin, and there’s all sorts of emotions tied up with that.”</p> <p class="p2">“Are we talking about how high we can make the midriffs go?” Henry asked from across the kitchen island, where he was chopping vegetables.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When he turned, his eyebrows drifted upwards.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I take it back, Sammy, you’re dressed very nicely.”</p> <p class="p2">“That was a dig,” Rowan informed Sammy in an unsubtle stage whisper, and patted her exposed belly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The girl wore a cropped white tank that did not cover so much as complement the flowered bra underneath, along with daisy duke shorts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She did have a whole lot of skin on display.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“But I have to dress so fucking boring for the lab, I have to balance it out somehow.”</p> <p class="p2">“So sorry your internship is such a poor fashion venue,” Henry mock-sympathized he brought a big bowl of salad to the table. “But if you do want to make endo your career, honey, all your fresh, hot looks will be swallowed up by lab coats most of your days.”</p> <p class="p2">Sitting down across the table, Rowan mouthed “fresh, hot looks” at Sammy with a roll of her eyes.</p> <p class="p2">Henry sat next to Rowan and shot a smile across the table.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“How is the Marginalized Scholars Program treating you, Sammy?”</p> <p class="p2">“It’s good,” he answered automatically and immediately, and then nodded to assemble his thoughts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It is a challenge.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There’s… a lot of work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A lot of reading.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Labs start up this week, for bio and… well, it’s called Physics but we’re doing chemistry in the labs.”</p> <p class="p2">“Sounds like you’ve got a lot on your plate,” Gideon said as he settled into his seat next to Sammy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then he added with a smirk: “He says, being responsible for one-sixth of that courseload.”</p> <p class="p2">“Oh, you’re more than one-sixth,” Sammy jibed back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You had us reading three different books just to start off!”</p> <p class="p2">Gideon shrugged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Contrasting opinions, multiple perspectives.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>History’s a complex field.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He served himself some salad and passed the bowl along to Sammy.</p> <p class="p2">“Is it too much?” Henry wanted to know, suddenly serious.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The man’s emotions and facial expressions seemed to turn on a dime.</p> <p class="p2">But Sammy shook his head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“No sir, I um.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This sounds silly, but I got a day planner?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And I wrote out all my assignments and figured out when I’m doing what so that it all gets done by the time it’s due.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And it’s—” he chuckled, or giggled, and it had just a hint of the manic to it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I mean, I’ve scheduled my every waking hour for the next two weeks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So yeah, it’s… intense, but I think I’ve got a handle on it.”</p> <p class="p2">“What about dating?” Rowan asked, all innocence.</p> <p class="p2">He shared a secret smile across the table.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I have kept my Friday nights free.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Just in case.”</p> <p class="p2">“Do you have any free time on Sunday evenings?” Gideon asked, with a surprising amount of hesitation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He nodded across the table to Henry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“We were kind of hoping to make this a weekly thing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Have you over for a home-cooked meal, have some family downtime.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If that’s something you’d want.”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy leaned over to bump shoulders against his uncle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I kind of got the impression you would, so I set aside Sunday dinners, too.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Plus travel time.”</p> <p class="p2">“Wow, you really are organized,” Rowan grinned across the table.</p> <p class="p2">“Well, we’ll see if it holds up,” Sammy laughed.</p> <p class="p2">“How are the classes?” Henry asked, cutting apart his chicken breast into little cubes, all exactly the same size.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Remedial education is difficult to execute, especially in an accelerated format.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s so easy to lose students by moving too fast.”</p> <p class="p2">“Well my history class hasn’t even started on the actual history,” Sammy said, with a sidelong smirk at Gideon.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s all theory and feminism and economic justice.”</p> <p class="p2">“Oh, don’t worry, we’ll get to the names and dates soon enough,” Gideon promised.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Gotta lay the foundation first.”</p> <p class="p2">Henry nodded.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“College works differently than high school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s new ways of looking at old material.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When it’s not actually doing the work, rather than reviewing others’ work.”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy frowned softly at his green beans.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It took him a beat before he screwd up the courage to say, “I’m not sure I know what you mean.”</p> <p class="p2">“In high school, you learn the biology that other people figured out,” Henry explained, gesturing with his fork.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“In college, and especially in university, you do the biology yourself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You do labs, you do experiments, sometimes you help with research.”</p> <p class="p2">“You titrate samples,” Rowan put in, “and then you titrate more samples, and after that, you guessed it, you titrate samples again.”</p> <p class="p2">“You were just telling me how exciting the work was,” Gideon laughed at his daughter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Are you bored already?”</p> <p class="p2">“No,” she sighed, drawing out the vowel.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s just the data analysis is more interesting than the data collection.”</p> <p class="p2">“Ain’t that the truth,” her other father sympathized.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“That’s the real reason why everyone wants to claw their way to the top of the academic pyramid, you know: because then you get other people to do the collection, and you can just sit at a desk and poke at the numbers.”</p> <p class="p2">Gideon leaned towards Sammy, conspiratorially.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s only like that over in the STEM side of things.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Over in the humanities, the data collection is the fun stuff, because then you’re talking with people.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or reading new sources.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or hunting through records, unlocking stories.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That’s the fun stuff.”</p> <p class="p2">“Looking foward to it,” he grinned back.</p> <p class="p2">But Gideon made a face.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Sadly, I don’t think we’ll have time to actually <i>do</i> history this summer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not that I’d really know how to do it, anyway.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s not properly my field.”</p> <p class="p2">“So how is it that you’re teaching it?”</p> <p class="p2">Gideon twirled his half-eaten roll in the air.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Vagaries of academic politics and scheduling.”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy made a mental note to figure out what ‘vagaries’ meant.</p> <p class="p2">Gideon went on: “The course was supposed to be taught by Christchurch—old departmental battleaxe, she’s awesome—but she had a medical emergency at the last minute.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Everybody else in the department was already out of town or committed to other projects, so they had nobody.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But Henry was paying attention to the program because you were in it, caught wind of their little scheduling crisis, and told them I was available.”</p> <p class="p2">“Daddy got one person into the program, why not two?” Rowan giggled.</p> <p class="p2">“I was supposed to be starting my sabbatical,” Gideon sighed theatrically, “but I’m not going to pass on opportunities to do favours for prestigious academic departments, either.”</p> <p class="p2">But Sammy hadn’t missed what Rowan had said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Who else did you get into the program, Uncle Henry?” he asked, eyebrows lifted.</p> <p class="p2">“You, of course,” Rowan answered for him, laughing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Henry glowered gently at her, and she rolled her eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“What?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m very proud of your bureaucratic wrangling, Daddy, and you should be, too.”</p> <p class="p2">“I was kind of wondering how I got in,” Sammy admitted slowly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“My best guess was that I’d applied to it accidentally.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There were so many scholarship applications and grant forms, I sort of lost track.”</p> <p class="p2">“There isn’t an application process, per se,” Henry explained gruffly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s a vetting process that admissions does, typically with their international applications.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Students who look promising but who haven’t had all the educational advantages that they might have.”</p> <p class="p2">“But I’m not an international student.”</p> <p class="p2">His uncle shrugged his shoulders, minimizing the distinction and his own interference.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I had lunch with the admissions director and gently pointed out that MSP made no provisions for queer marginalization.”</p> <p class="p2">“He’s softballing,” Rowan put in.</p> <p class="p2">Uncle Henry shot daggers at his daughter, but then admitted: “I may have described my own childhood and adolescence in Oak Grove, and how being a weird queer kid meant that there were fewer opportunities for me growing up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And I happened to know that another queer kid from Oak Grove, trans and closetted, had just applied.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He put up his hands.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I made it quite clear from the outset that you were my niece.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I didn’t want any favours.”</p> <p class="p2">Rowan rolled her eyes at that.</p> <p class="p2">Henry apparently didn’t see.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I just suggested that he might consider queer domestic applications,” he went on, but then he couldn’t keep a victorious smile from his lips.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And the next thing I knew, you’d got in.”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy put a smile on his lips.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Thank you,” he managed, thoughts and emotions roiling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His uncle was a big deal, and it wasn’t implausible that admissions had invited Sammy into the program just to mollify him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But if Henry was to be believed, his application had still been considered, had still been part of their decision.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With a sinking feeling he realized that the distinction between his own merit and his family’s nepotism was always going to be murky.</p> <p class="p2">Gideon’s warm hand gently covered Sammy’s, and his uncle gave him a gentle squeeze.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sammy glanced over at him, and something about his expression brought his words from a week ago back to Sammy: <i>Take what you can get, babe.</i><i></i></p> <p class="p2">He nodded, mostly to himself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s an amazing opportunity,” he rallied, “and I’m going to make the most of it.”</p> <p class="p2">Dinner conversation shifted to local politics, in which both Gideon and Henry were active and with which both of them were presently annoyed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>From there they talked about nothing: the weather, a recent movie, even sports for a few moments (Henry was a Yankees fan).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Eager to stop talking about baseball, Rowan let drop that Sammy had been on a date, and so he had to recount all those details all over again, ears and cheeks burning.</p> <p class="p2">Gideon, at least, steered the conversation away once the basic details had been covered.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Who wants cookies?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>From Levain Bakery.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not homemade, cause nobody in this house is <i>that</i> domestic.”</p> <p class="p2">“I can make cookies,” protested Henry, affronted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Cookies aren’t hard.”</p> <p class="p2">Gideon gave him a pitying look as he returned with a branded paper bag.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Can you make cookies like Levain’s?”</p> <p class="p2">“No,” Henry grumped, allowing the point with a short nod.</p> <p class="p2">The cookies were distributed and they were, indeed, amazing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Nothing like the cookies his mom or Gramma would make, not that theirs were inferior.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Just different.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These were light and fluffy and somehow also full of nuts and chocolate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Almost more like cake than chewy cookies.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And they were huge: each one the size of Sammy’s hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He wasn’t sure he could eat more than one.</p> <p class="p2">Sammy’s uncles fell into a conversation about different local bakeries which neither Rowan nor Sammy were interested or qualified to participate in, so they just smiled across the table at each other and enjoyed their cookies.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This was, Sammy reflected, rather nice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’d have to be sure to thank his uncles for getting him out of his school routine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He knew he’d be looking forward to Sunday evenings.</p> <p class="p2">“Oh, Sammy,” said Rowan, leaning forward to dig into her back pocket.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I got you a present.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She slid a small envelope across the table.</p> <p class="p2">“Oh, thank you,” he answered automatically, picking up the unmarked envelope and opening it up.</p> <p class="p2">Inside was a hand-made card; the outside read “Gift Certificate” in swooping letters, surrounded by flowers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The colours had the look of being hand stamped, and not amatuerishly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He smiled; it was pretty.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Inside was calligraphy reading: “This certificate entitles the bearer to Ten Weeks of Voice Training Lessons.”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy looked to Rowan, confused.</p> <p class="p2">“It’s with my old voice coach,” she told him, beaming with excitement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“She’s trans, and specializes in transfemme voice training.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She’s really really good.”</p> <p class="p2">“Oh, Vanessa?” Gideon smiled, apparently as surprised at the gift as Sammy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“How is she doing?”</p> <p class="p2">Rowan made an unhappy face.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Struggling, unfortunately.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The problem with serving the trans community is that most of us are broke, can’t afford to pay her what would amount to a living wage, and she keeps taking on clients who pay her half-rate, so… she’s broke, too.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She sighed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And she just lost her roommate.”</p> <p class="p2">Both uncles made sympathetic noises.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even Sammy knew how calamitous the rent was in the City, and he might have chimed in with a vaguely supportive noise.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But mostly he was staring at the card.</p> <p class="p2">He looked up at Rowan.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“What is… what’s voice training?” he managed to ask, although he had a growing suspicion.</p> <p class="p2">Rowan placed two fingers on the top of her sternum.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It teaches you how to speak like this, soft and light and girly,” she said, eyes fluttering in overacted pride.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Or however else you want to sound.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But you can’t just… put on your best girly voice, Sammy, it doesn’t work that way.”</p> <p class="p2">“I hadn’t… really even tried to do that,” he admitted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His mind’s eye flashed to the restaurant on Friday, to the grill in the dining commons.</p> <p class="p2">Rowan snorted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Yeah, I know.”</p> <p class="p2">“Is there… something wrong with how I sound?” he asked uncertainly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Despite his best effort, he couldn’t keep the barest trace of hurt out of his voice.</p> <p class="p2">“Oh no,” Rowan responded immediately, eyes suddenly wide in panic.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Sammy, I didn’t mean to— fuck, I’m going about this all wrong.”</p> <p class="p2">Gideon placed a hand on Sammy’s shoulder.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You don’t have to do voice training to be trans,” he counseled gently.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And a ton of transgender people never do.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They’re happy with how they sound, and that works for them.”</p> <p class="p2">He looked over at his uncle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Did you?”</p> <p class="p2">His uncle coloured slightly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I didn’t, but testosterone did a number on my voice all by itself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Unfortunately, transfemmes don’t get the same.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If they want to sound feminine, they have to train their voices to sound that way.”</p> <p class="p2">“Like everything else, it’s optional,” Rowan insisted from across the table, desperate to fix her overstep.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“But I can tell you that I got a lot out of it, and right now… listen, your voice isn’t wrong, but it’s kind of…”</p> <p class="p2">“It’s a tell,” Sammy finished for her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The server on Friday, flinching when he asked about fish.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or the grill guy, who was all smiles until Sammy opened his mouth.</p> <p class="p2">“Yeah, if you like,” Rowan bobbed her head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And there’s nothing wrong with being visibly trans, Sammy, but it’s also good to have options, and learn what you can do, you know?”</p> <p class="p2">He looked down at the card, trying and mostly succeeding at not scowling at the inoffensive piece of cardstock.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His voice was giving him away, making it clear to everybody that he was just pretending to be a girl.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But did he care?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He could be visibly trans for seven more weeks, and then tell them all he was detransitioning.</p> <p class="p2">Seven weeks was a long time for people to be staring at him.</p> <p class="p2">He almost asked “Is it permanent? Can I go back afterwards?” but stopped himself just in time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He didn’t want to tip his hand on his detransition plans.</p> <p class="p2">Instead he said, “But I’m so busy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I mean, I’ve got every waking hour scheduled.”</p> <p class="p2">“She has a weekly appointment on Tuesday evenings open,” Rowan said, as if she were confessing a sin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I asked her to pencil you in, because I knew that wouldn’t conflict with your classes.”</p> <p class="p2">Tuesday evenings he was… reading something, he forgot what.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This was why he’d bought a day planner.</p> <p class="p2">“And it would really help out Vanessa,” his cousin sighed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“She’s too proud to just take money to tide her over till she finds a roommate, so I just thought… two birds, one stone, you know?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She looked from Sammy to her dads, hoping for some validation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“She just doesn’t want to have to move back to Wisconsin.”</p> <p class="p2">“It was a nice thought,” Gideon told her soothingly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“But if Sammy’s too busy—”</p> <p class="p2">“I’ll do it,” Sammy heard himself saying.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hearing that Vanessa would have to move out of the City had twisted like a knife in his gut.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even if he didn’t understand anything else, he understood that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s just an hour a week, right?”</p> <div class="wi_authornotes"> <div> <div class="p-avatar-wrap"><a class="avatar has-link" href="https://scribblehub.com/profile/149271/miriamrobern/"><img id="acc_ava_change profile" alt="" src="https://cdn.scribblehub.com/avatar/s/37/ava_149271_1743989956.jpg"></a></div> <p><span class="an_username"><a href="https://scribblehub.com/profile/149271/miriamrobern/">miriamrobern</a></span></div> <div style="clear: both;"></div> <div class="wi_authornotes_body"> <h2><b>Thanks for Reading!</b><b></b></h2> <p class="p7">If you’d like to see more like this, please consider subscribing to my patreon at http://patreon.com/miriamrobern</p> <p>&gt; I post all chapters a month early for subscribers, so you can read ahead.</p> <p>&gt; I also post epub and pdf versions of the book for everybody.</p> <p class="p7">Thanks for your support, whether it’s becoming a subscriber or posting comments online.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s people like you who let people like me make stuff like this!</p> </div></div></p> </div>

                <div class="chp_raw" id="chp_raw"><p class="p2">"Is anyone else kinda freaked out about just being here?" asked Samantha Jensen.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"If they find out–I mean, if they think we're doing something that we shouldn't be–" She turned her pale face to the bay windows, to where Cole's pillory still stood, now empty.</p> <p class="p2">"To anybody else," I told her, trying to sound both perfectly calm and perfectly confident, "we just look like a little knot of friends sitting and talking in the Mess."</p> <p class="p2">I turned my calm, confident smile across the gathered friends sitting along both sides of the long table.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Maggie sat opposite me, eyes fierce with excitement at finally bringing so many people in our network face-to-face.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Next to her sat Barry, whose facial hair was already beginning to resemble the civil war officers he used to impersonate in reenactments.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then came Felicity, who somehow always looked clean and fresh despite taking weekly showers like the rest of us.</p> <p class="p2">At the end sat the Jensens, Steven and Samantha, who I had not expected to turn up, especially as a pair.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I had mentioned the meeting to Steven without enthusiasm, angling for his disinterest and hedging that, if he somehow found out later, he wouldn't feel left out because he had known.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Instead he brought his wife, something of an unknown quantity to all of us.</p> <p class="p2">Opposite the Jensens sat Mischa and his solemn-faced granddaughter Trina, there to dutifully translate for him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>George, sitting next to her, had tried to goad a smile from her to no avail.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His own daughters, about the same age, played under the watchful eye and half-listening ear of his wife Gini, one table over.</p> <p class="p2">Hank had planted himself at the midpoint of the table, intent on making this meeting a success, even if he wasn't quite sure how.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was quick to listen, at the very least, but by the way his whole body leaned forward, it was plain his top priority was getting something–anything–done before dinner.</p> <p class="p2">Rachel and Rebecca had sat down next to me. Unsurprising since I was the only face the Grey Wolf girls knew.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They were all smiles and excitement, eager to make new friends.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rachel had brought a guitar as promised.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I wasn't sure whether to wonder if they thought this was some kind of summer camp or to try and puzzle out how a poolie had kept her hands on a piece of personal property.</p> <p class="p2">"If any sweeties look suspicious," the young woman spoke up, and patted the six-string behind her affectionately, "we can sing some camp songs to throw them off."</p> <p class="p2">For a moment I considered the possibility that she had brought the thing entirely for that purpose–as cheery-faced cover for potential sedition.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Just how wily was this girl?</p> <p class="p2">"I don't think we're doing anything wrong," Steven told the group, but primarily his wife.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Like Susan said, we're mostly here just to… get to know each other, right?"</p> <p class="p2">I nodded.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"It's my hope that the primary takeaway here is that we learn each other's names and faces, so we know there are sympathetic allies nearby, working alongside us, eating one table over at the Mess, sleeping two rows down in the barracks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although not that last bit for the two of you," I added with a nod to Rebecca and Rachel.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"In fact, I'd like to talk with you about branching out into Grey Wolf at some point this afternoon."</p> <p class="p2">The young women smiled at that and started to agree when Steven interrupted.</p> <p class="p2">"And that's what I'm saying right?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There's nothing wrong with that."<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He looked up one side of the table and down the other.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Nobody's said that we can't do that."</p> <p class="p2">"Steven," I cut in with as much professional classroom authority as I could muster.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I paused a moment to get his full attention.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Right now we are networking.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But our goal is to change how things work around here.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And at some point, we will hit resistance to that."</p> <p class="p2">"If they are smart," piped up Trina's little voice, her grandfather speaking quietly to her in his native tongue, "they will be looking for poolies trying to organize, so that they can stop us."</p> <p class="p2">"So then maybe what we do," suggested Steven, "is we go straight to them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Hosts, I mean.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Director.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Transparency, right?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We tell them how bad it is.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We… make our suggestions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We demonstrate solidarity.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Solidarity, right?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And, I mean… they've got to understand, right, that things have got to change."</p> <p class="p2">"Speaking as someone who has been the Powers That Be," Maggie put in laconically, "I can tell you from experience that to those in power, the solidarity of the powerless looks… quaint.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We will not get the Hosts to budge without flexing our muscles."</p> <p class="p2">George made a show of flexing his rail-thin arms.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After a few months in the refuge, though, the effort resulted in a display of lean, ropey muscle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He seemed as surprised as anybody and quickly lowered his busted joke from view.</p> <p class="p2">Mischa murmured to Trina, who declared, "The ones with guns will not listen to the ones without guns."</p> <p class="p2">"Well then," interjected Barry, "let's get our hands on some guns."</p> <p class="p2">I leaned forward to moderate, but Maggie spoke before I could.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"That's a bad idea," she said flatly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As she spoke, she speared every other person at the table with a significant look.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"We are in no shape to do that, not yet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We don't have the manpower, we don't have the access, we don't have anyplace to hide them if we get them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yet."</p> <p class="p2">I pursed my lips.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a question I had expected, and had not wanted to be the wet blanket who said no.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But Maggie's response was hardly the way that I would have answered it, either.</p> <p class="p2">"Susan?" came Hank's voice, querulous.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Is that where we're going?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Is… gunning up what you aim for this group to do?"<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He looked worriedly from me to Maggie and back.</p> <p class="p2">"I don't know where we're going," I admitted, inwardly wincing at my delivery of uncertainty when Hank was clearly asking for the opposite.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"But I do know that right now, guns are not the answer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Right now guns will just get people shot."<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The table was suddenly silent, as if no one had realized that guns might get somebody hurt.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"The stakes are high.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We need to be very careful about what we decide to do."</p> <p class="p2">"How…" started Hank, stumbled, and then tried again.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"How are we going to make those decisions?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I mean, not to put it so crudely, but who's in charge, here?"</p> <p class="p2">"Oh, are we going to have elections?" George grinned like the Cheshire Cat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I'd like to declare my candidacy for Treasurer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There being no money anymore, I think the work load will suit me just fine."</p> <p class="p2">This question I hadn't expected on our first outing, but given Hank's involvement I should have known better.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He'd probably like to elect a whole board of trustees.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I'm not sure we really need anyone in charge or elections, not yet," I moderated again.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I think what we have right now is a loose network, and that's more than we had when we came through the gates–"</p> <p class="p2">"You know what we need," put in Felicity with a bright smile, "to help us push past 'loose network' and into an organization that can really do some good?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We need a name."</p> <p class="p2">"I think that could also give us a sense of purpose," agreed Hank.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"The banner we rally behind."</p> <p class="p2">"The Grimy Revolution," suggested George.</p> <p class="p2">"The Unwashed Masses," countered Rebecca with a display of faux disgust at her own shirt.</p> <p class="p2">"Maybe something less confrontational," pleaded Steven.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Like… the Improvement Committee."</p> <p class="p2">"The Committee for Public Improvement!" George chortled.</p> <p class="p2">The conversation fractured into a jumble of suggested names, increasingly trending towards the comedic.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I sat back and let them blow off steam.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What we were doing was, after all, mind-numbingly dangerous.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Might eventually get us all pilloried, if not killed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I caught Maggie's eye and we shared a smile.</p> <p class="p2">"Is this what you wanted?" I said with my eyebrows.</p> <p class="p2">She shrugged, perfectly communicating, "It's a start."</p> <p class="p2">“What about Tall Pines Underground?” said Rebecca with a shrug.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s simple and to the point, right?”</p> <p class="p2">“With just a little frission of linguistic surprise,” George chuckled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Tall Pines, but they’re Underground?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What?”</p> <p class="p2">But a moment later the playful banter and now increasingly pun-derived names came to a sudden halt.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I looked to the rest of the table to see what had silenced them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Half stared down at the table.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The other half stared just over my shoulder.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I turned.</p> <p class="p2">Esther Bukhari loomed behind me, eyebrow arched.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Susan," she growled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"A word."</p> <p class="p2">—</p> <p class="p2">I scrambled to my feet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Caught already, in our very first meeting?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Was Mischa right, were the Hosts and sweeties watching us?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But Bukhari was stepping away from the table, expecting me to follow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Singling me out, not calling down judgement on the whole table.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I raised a placating hand to the others.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Stay calm, I tried to say with just a look.</p> <p class="p2">"Sorry about interrupting Book Club," Bukhari drawled when I caught up with her.</p> <p class="p2">The smile I gave her was far too bright, too relieved.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She thought we were up to nothing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She thought we were a knot of friends chatting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I dialed down my expression.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"It's okay," I heard myself say.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"What can I… what can I do for you, ma'am?"</p> <p class="p2">If she noted the respectful address, she made no sign of it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She took a pull from her ever-present, glaringly orange bottle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Jameson says you have a box," she said as if she were bored.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I need to know where you put it."</p> <p class="p2">That brought me up short.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"A box?" I stammered.</p> <p class="p2">"You and your whippersnappers interrupted his people doing some work a couple nights back," she said, voice growing harder and sharper.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"You ran off with a box."</p> <p class="p2">"I'm not sure I know what you're–"</p> <p class="p2">The woman rolled her eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Don't even, Susan.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You called your kids by name in front of them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It took them a couple days, but they tracked you down.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And they asked me to ask you where you put their box."</p> <p class="p2">"It's not their box," I protested weakly.</p> <p class="p2">Bukhari tipped her head to the side, her perfect glossy-black bang bouncing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"You think I care.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It's Jameson, Susan.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He's a Host.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He tells the likes of you and I something in the refuge is his, it is."</p> <p class="p2">My brow crinkled at that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The woman kept her voice low as she spoke to me, as if she didn't want to be overheard.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My friends were easily out of earshot; a handful of poolies sat scattered throughout the Mess besides us.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Did Bukhari want no one to hear this exchange?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Why?</p> <p class="p2">"Besides, it's not a box," I pressed for time to figure out her angle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"It's a shrine."</p> <p class="p2">The woman actually snorted at that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Well it's no wonder he wants it, then, is it?"</p> <p class="p2">"He wants to destroy it!" I hissed, raising my voice just enough to draw attention.</p> <p class="p2">She immediately stepped close, voice cautionary and low.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An unspoken demand that I do likewise.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"No shit.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And you and I are going to fucking help him, like good little footsoldiers."</p> <p class="p2">It took me a few more heartbeats before I figured it out.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Oh.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Jameson came to you," I said, "Directly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Abernathy doesn't know you're here."</p> <p class="p2">The flash of her eyes confirmed it immediately.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Tell me where you hid the shrine, Susan."</p> <p class="p2">I took a step backwards, considered my answer carefully, and said, "No."</p> <p class="p2">Bukhari's eyebrows floated upwards as if they were about to leave her face entirely.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She tried to force a chuckle through her nose.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I'm sorry, what did you just say to me?"</p> <p class="p2">I dared not spare a glance backwards to my friends, but I did raise my voice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I said no, Bukhari.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I'm not helping you."</p> <p class="p2">She studiously did not look around at the other poolies in the Mess.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We could both feel the eyes on us.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"You," she grated, "will do as I say, or I will make your life a living hell."</p> <p class="p2">I laughed at that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You think it’s not already a living hell?"<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Before she could respond, I waved a hand towards the Mess’s east wall, and Ponderosa beyond it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Tell you what, I'll go with you to talk with Abernathy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We'll tell him what Jameson wants, and I'll tell him what it actually is, and we'll see what he thinks about it."</p> <p class="p2">She stared at me with hatred boiling behind her eyes.</p> <p class="p2">"If Abernathy agrees that the 'box' needs to be turned over, I'll cooperate," I told her, trying and failing to dampen the fierce grin digging into my cheeks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I knew I had her, and so did she.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her fingers flexed around her water bottle as if she wanted to throw it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Suddenly I remembered the gun at her hip.</p> <p class="p2">With an effort, I forced myself to step closer and lower my voice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I'm sorry, Esther," I told her as gently as I could.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The skin around her eyes leapt and tensed, uncertain how to respond.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I've put you in a spot, and in front of an audience.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That was… unkind of me."</p> <p class="p2">"I don't need your kindness," she all but spat at me.</p> <p class="p2">"Well brace yourself, you're getting it anyway," I told her with a perverse smirk I'd seen on her face more than once.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Cause I can tell you the way out of this little debacle."</p> <p class="p2">She said nothing, which I took as permission to go on.</p> <p class="p2">"You go back to Jameson," I told her quietly, "and you tell him I told you it's somebody's shrine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Somebody's sacred place of fucking worship.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Which he didn't tell you, did he.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And you tell him that you can't be a part of whatever he's got planned for that shrine."</p> <p class="p2">Her lips drew pencil-thin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"And why would I do that?"</p> <p class="p2">I smiled as generously as I could.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Because you're a decent person, Esther."</p> <p class="p2">Baiting her in front of poolies and challenging her authority in public paled before the response that got.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her face flushed red, eyes flashing dangerously.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I could hear the bottle creak under her clutching fingers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Through clenched teeth, she growled, "Have you met me?"</p> <p class="p2">"I've seen the act," I answered. "Blithe indifference to everyone around her, easy acceptance of the crushing oppression she lives on top of.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The water bottle you pretend is full of mimosas every day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Esther, there isn't that much orange juice in the refuge, let alone champagne or even hootch.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But you want us to think you're drinking.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I imagine it would have been a lot more bearable if you were."</p> <p class="p2">She said nothing.</p> <p class="p2">"You were a decent person once," I told her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"You can be a decent person again.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And you're lucky, because today being a decent person saves you face."<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I tipped my head to the side to indicate our audience.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I've just told you that the box is a shrine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That's why you're so angry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not at me, but at Jameson."</p> <p class="p2">She looked me in the eye, unwavering, for a long moment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"This is not acceptable," she told me, and then repeated herself, louder.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"This.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Is Not.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Acceptable."</p> <p class="p2">And then she spun on her heel and stalked out of the Mess.</p> <p class="p2">I didn't sit back down, just in case anyone was watching.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In case word got back to Bukhari after she decided she wanted to retaliate against me, against whatever friends she could identify.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I gave them a nod, a light encouragement to go on without me, and went for a walk.</p> <p class="p2">It had been easy to think of the Hosts as a unified power block, as working together, as conspiring to keep us under their thumb.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But the world isn't as simple as that, of course.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It's not simple enough for the poolies to join together in solidarity and just magically fix every problem.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It's not simple enough for the Hosts to see and act and speak with one voice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And that, I realized as I walked up the gravelly main road and up into the walipinis, was their weakness.</p> <p class="p2">They were vulnerable.</p> <p class="p2">I had spent months, now, skulking through the refuge.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Months watching and waiting, trying to puzzle out how dangerous the place was, and how.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If there were safe places, and where they were.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Trying to find some calm corner to squeeze my family into, where nothing would touch them for howeverlong we had to stay here.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And in that time, I was making such a simple error: I assumed the Hosts were unified.</p> <p class="p2">Abernathy must be an aberration, or at worst a weak-willed enabler, I had told myself, hating the very idea, feeling guilty for even thinking so poorly of him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But he was no aberration, just a tired old man.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Different from the other Hosts – as they were no doubt different from each other.</p> <p class="p2">Each of them with more power than they had ever had, each of them with their own agenda.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each of them suspicious of the others.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each of them making moves, as carefully and quietly as possible, to preserve their vision for the future.</p> <p class="p2">There was opportunity there.</p> <p class="p2">I stepped down into a walipini, smiling as the warm, wet air hit my skin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I found an empty bed, recently harvested, and sat on the soft, churned earth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I looked up and down the length of the garden, at all the tender, growing green things, sheltered in this weird, half-buried greenhouse.</p> <p class="p2">I would have to be careful.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We would have to be careful.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We would have to listen, to watch, to prepare, and in the right moment act.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sow confusion, suspicion, dissention.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sabotage when it served us, preserve when we could.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But most of all, slowly drive our jailers and overseers mad with intrigues, fouled ambitions, and bottled rage.</p> <p class="p2">We would dismantle the refuge, host by host.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sweetie by sweetie, if necessary.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Set them against each other, watch them squabble, and then dispose of the wreckage they made of each other.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And no one would be left but us poolies.</p> <p class="p2">I watched the green leaves as the light through the polypropelene turned red and finally began to fade.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When I judged there was just enough light left to get back to the compound, I got up to go.</p> <p class="p2">I had work to do.</p> <p class="p2">—</p> <p class="p2">Sound in the refuge was feast or famine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the press of poolies working and grumbling and gossipping, the cacophony was almost unbearable.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rocks chipping, shovels biting into the ground, saws grating across felled trees, shouts at each other to step back, watch out, shut your lying mouth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Arguments over trivia that no one could confirm or life-and-death decisions no one had any control over.</p> <p class="p2">If you could get away from your work crew, though, sent on an errand or delivering a batch of whatever your crew was working on that day, you stepped into another, quieter world.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The distant rush of the wind would sigh up the mountainside, tossing the tops of the trees back and forth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lonely birdsong echoed through the forest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It grew quiet enough that you could hear each claw on a squirrel's paw tap against the branch she climbed along.</p> <p class="p2">No one was quite sure when the last commercial plane past overhead, but it had been a month at least.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No trembling grumble of high-up jet engines broke the stillness of the mountain.</p> <p class="p2">Which is why, as I stepped out of the infirmary I could hear the faint pop-pop-pop of submachine guns from some distance on the other side of the wall.</p> <p class="p2">I backpedalled to stick my head inside the door of the infirmary.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"There's gunshots outside the wall," I told the man behind the desk.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Figured you guys might want to know in case you need to… get ready or something."</p> <p class="p2">The receptionist only bobbed his head in answer and then ducked deeper into the building.</p> <p class="p2">When I turned back outside, the front gate was boiling like a kicked-over anthill.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Wolfpack soldiers and other sweeties ran down the hill to charge up the stairs and up onto the walls.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rifles, liberated from gun lockers upstairs, were tossed into waiting hands.</p> <p class="p2">"Poolie!" shouted a man in uniform, advancing on me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"What are you doing down here?"</p> <p class="p2">I gestured vaguely at the infirmary behind me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I was dropping off a–"</p> <p class="p2">"Nevermind, you need to get out of here.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This area's about to get hot."<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He pumped his arm, two fingers pointing me back uphill. "Get back up to your work site."</p> <p class="p2">With the sound of gunfire fast approaching, I wasn't about to argue.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I hurried up the gravel road.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Are we– are we going to be safe?" I asked the soldier as I went.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I had to find the boys, get us to shelter.</p> <p class="p2">"We'll keep you safe, ma'am," he responded with practiced confidence.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"The ringers following this patrol are going to get a real unpleasant surprise when they hit the wall."<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He must have seen some consternation on my face because he actually chuckled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"They're not getting inside."</p> <p class="p2">I nodded numbly, and hiked up the hill.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The gunfire behind me was sporadic but nearing; the shouts of sweeties on the ramparts kept blotting it out.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As I reached the top of the first rise, however, shouts from outside the walls rang out.</p> <p class="p2">From my vantage I could see only snatches of the treeline beyond the wall.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Small groups of figures, three and four at a time, burst from the trees.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In each knot of people, one or two were lugging heavy-looking cases.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The rest ran backwards, firing back into the trees, laying down cover fire.</p> <p class="p2">"There they are!" someone on the wall shouted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A trio of soldiers behind the main gate started spinning the huge silver wheel that would unlock the bank vault door.</p> <p class="p2">I could no longer see our people, but now other figures were staggering out of the trees.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They were lean, dirty, hard-worn men, most in black leather jackets.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The sight of the wall visibly astounded many.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most halted in their tracks and scrambled back to the cover afforded by the forest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A few, though, let loose shouts and cries, pumping their legs to charge after their quarry before they could make the gate.</p> <p class="p2">The rifles along the wall opened up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The pursuers sprayed spurts of crimson and fell.</p> <p class="p2">The great door finally swung open, spilling our returning people into the refuge.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Their entry aspired to orderliness and failed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some threw themselves onto the ground as soon as they were safe.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The rest stumbled over them.</p> <p class="p2">A gangly woman lugging the lead end of a huge black footlocker kicked at their prone bodies as she came through the door.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Up! Up!" her sharp voice carried over the rattling reports of the guns.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She and her compatriot on the other end of the locker hauled it ten more feet inside before dropping it to the ground.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She plopped down on it, elbows on her knees, to catch her breath.</p> <p class="p2">I blinked, peered closer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I recognized her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Miranda.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We'd worked seminar weekends together.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Why hadn't I seen her in the refuge since lockdown?</p> <p class="p2">Director Cole came down the stairs from the gatehouse and the woman on the crate greeted him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I couldn't hear the conversation, but she patted the crate proudly more than once.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Cole's demeanor vacillated between concern and confrontation more than once.</p> <p class="p2">The conference was interrupted as the two soldiers at the gate opened fire through the portal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A man from outside careened into them, battering the pair into the gatehouse wall.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Unlike his biker gang friends, this one was decked out in riot gear.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He threw his body at the half-opened door, heaving it wider open.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even from my distance I could hear him shouting encouragements to his compatriots.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I couldn't see if there was anyone behind him, or if he hadn't realized they had all been mowed down already.</p> <p class="p2">But the invader had two guns of his own, and started spraying bullets left and right.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Soldiers and patrol members alike hit the ground to return fire.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Cole shoved Miranda down behind the crate she had been sitting on and joined her there, all in one fluid motion.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Belatedly, I realized I should do the same.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was well within the range of stray bullets.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I lurched behind a thick trunk at the side of the gravel road.</p> <p class="p2">I peeked around the other side of the tree just in time to see Cole make his move.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Director grabbed something off the tactical vest of a fallen soldier and flung it at the attacker in riot gear.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A sudden flash and gout of smoke blossomed forth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even as I blinked, Cole catapulted himself over the crate and into the invader.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Both went down in a flailing heap of limbs.</p> <p class="p2">The crack of a single shot echoed through the refuge, and Director Cole staggered up to his feet again.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The other man did not move.</p> <p class="p2">It seemed silent for a moment, even though the guns on the wall were still shooting, sweeties and Wolfpack still shouting to each other.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All that seemed far away from the scene just inside the gate, where soldiers were quickly inspecting Cole for any holes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He batted them away, pointed them at their fallen comrades, and everyone set to dragging bodies away from the still-open gate.</p> <p class="p2">Just as I was about to worry about more invaders, the rip and roar of motorcycle engines filled the air.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Three dirt bikes tore past me, down the gravel road, and rocketed through the cleared gate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The riders all wore the green and black uniform of the Wolfpack.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Two more trios of bikes followed in short order.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The gunfire from the wall had died down, and I could hear the dirtbike whines scale up and down beyond the wall.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sporadic gunfire stuttered a few more times; the dirt bikes grew fainter.</p> <p class="p2">It took me a moment to realize: the soldiers on the bikes were running down any surviving attackers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No one could be allowed to stagger away with any knowledge of the refuge's existence.</p> <p class="p2">The fight was over.</p> <p class="p2">Down in front of the gate, Cole was shouting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The huge black crate stood open, and the Director gesticulated wildly at its interior.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He snatched up other crates, snapping them open, and then throwing them down in disgust.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He turned to rage at Miranda.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At my distance, all his words were garbled, but the emotion behind them was clear.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Finally I caught one phrase: "Get me Abernathy!"</p> <p class="p2">—</p> <p class="p2">Miranda arrived at the barracks that evening with a ball of half-folded clothes in her arms.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Behind her trailed a young man carrying his own parcel.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His coloring was dark where hers was light, but their features were similar enough to mark him as her son.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His eyes and the tip of his nose were red, but now his face was screwed up in anger.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was not pent-up rage, but the kind of anger that you hold on to, clutch close to you, so you don't drown.</p> <p class="p2">His mother, by contrast, was surprisingly composed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As she stepped through the garage door, her features were fixed in a willfull, if disappointed, expression.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She looked across the array of bunks and hammocks as if she were shopping for furniture.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Excuse me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Excuse me?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Are there any unclaimed beds?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Where can my son and I sleep?"</p> <p class="p2">She still had trail dust on her, but beneath that she and her clothes were clean.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She looked tired and resigned, but not ragged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She looked sweetie, not poolie, and so no one was eager to give her an answer.</p> <p class="p2">I pushed myself through the gathering crowd.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Miranda!" I called out, and stepped in to give her a friendly hug.</p> <p class="p2">"Susan?" she responded, disbelieving. "Hey.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I didn't– I didn't even know you were in the refuge."<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She offered me a sheepish smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I'm out on patrol so often–"</p> <p class="p2">"Likewise," I answered, before she apologized for things she had no control over in front of people who might be happy to blame her anyway.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Not the patrol part, but the not knowing part.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I didn't even know there were patrols."</p> <p class="p2">"There may not be any more now," she said ruefully.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then she bounced the parcel in her arms.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Um…"</p> <p class="p2">"You need a bed," I nodded, and guided her deeper into the barracks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I'm afraid there aren't any bunks left, but we might find a couple hammocks next to each other…"</p> <p class="p2">"Next to each other's not necessary," glowered her son as he followed behind.</p> <p class="p2">Miranda cast a look of frustration and worry at the boy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Not necessary, but surely appreciated," she told me firmly.</p> <p class="p2">"Miss Soza?" came a familiar voice behind us, and the entire barracks seemed to, all together, murmur and then hush.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I turned to see Joseph Abernathy at the door.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"May I have a word with you, please?"</p> <p class="p2">"Of course," I answered immediately, and cast about for a friendly face.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Gini!" I called, and waved her closer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Can you find Miranda and her son a couple hammocks?"</p> <p class="p2">Abernathy faded back onto the slab of concrete that served as the barracks' porch, and waited for me under the floodlights in the gathering night.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A fluttery-winged bug turned wide circles above our heads, slamming its body into the light over and over again.</p> <p class="p2">"Susan, I need you and your family to gather up your things."</p> <p class="p2">My brow furrowed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I– I don't understand."</p> <p class="p2">The old man tipped his head back towards the barracks and looked mildly ill.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Miranda Jacobs has… vacated her suite in the lodge.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I would like to invite you to take her place."</p> <p class="p2">"She got kicked out?" I asked without thinking.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Of course she had; that was already plain.</p> <p class="p2">Abernathy's discomfort doubled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"It's not my idea of justice, Susan, but she put every one of us at risk.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Five of her patrol members were shot.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Two died.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The refuge's location came very close to being revealed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>May still have been revealed."</p> <p class="p2">"Yes, but–" I started, and then realized I didn't know what my objection was.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I pinched the bridge of my nose and took a deep breath.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"If you make living like a poolie a punishment, people are going to ask what the poolies did to deserve it."</p> <p class="p2">Abernathy pursed his lips.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Living in labor pool is not a punishment, but living in the lodge is a privilege, and one that can be lost."</p> <p class="p2">"Living in the lodge is what we all paid for!" I all but shouted at him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Those lodges wouldn't even exist if it hadn't been for us."</p> <p class="p2">He put up his hands placatingly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Susan.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As the man who designed, built, or rebuilt all five of those lodges, I am well aware of who paid for them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I doubt I disagree with anything you might say right now.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Which is why I need you."</p> <p class="p2">I ran a hand through my hair, or tried to.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Shower day was five days ago.</p> <p class="p2">"Director Cole insisted that Miranda lose her suite," he told me wearily.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I can't do anything about that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But it does mean I now have an empty room.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I'd like you to fill it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Because I can not think of anyone more qualified."</p> <p class="p2">"Joe, I…" I started, stumbled, blundered onwards.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I appreciate the thought, and the compliment, but I'm not sure I can accept.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I don't want to live like that when other people are living like…"<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I swept a hand back towards the barracks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"…this."</p> <p class="p2">"Which is why I need you, Susan," he pressed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I need you to help me fix…" and here he mirrored my gesture, taking in the press of poolies crammed into the barracks, "…this."</p> <p class="p2">I crossed my arms, uncomfortable and growing angry, and uncomfortable that I was angry at a man who was trying to do me a favor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I thought your plan was to hunker down and wait until it all blew over."</p> <p class="p2">Abernathy heaved a sigh, and suddenly I could see all of his years hanging on him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"A couple months ago, a young woman who I greatly respect guilted me out of that thinking."</p> <p class="p2">"Young?" I snorted, and the tension between us melted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Flattery is a little underhanded for you, Joe."</p> <p class="p2">He gave me a wan smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"If I wanted to use underhanded tactics, I'd ask you if you want your kids sleeping here or in the lodge."</p> <p class="p2">"Oh trust me, I never lost sight of that consideration."</p> <p class="p2">"There's two bunks waiting in the suite's second bedroom.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Jacobs boy slept on top and played his video games on the bottom."</p> <p class="p2">I closed my eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"And we will work to make things better?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For everybody?"</p> <p class="p2">"For everybody," he agreed.</p> <p class="p2">Slowly, I bobbed my head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Okay.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I accept.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Let's do it."</p> <p class="p2">The boys were waiting for me just inside the barracks' rolling garage door.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each of them had their clothes, bundled up, under their arms.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Jackson hefted my milk crate footlocker in his free hand, and offered it to me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With Miranda's entrance, everyone in the barracks knew exactly what Abernathy must have been talking to me about.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I took my milk crate without comment and stepped aside to let the boys file past.</p> <p class="p2">Arthur came behind them, leaning on a cane on his left side and bearing a bundle of clothes on his right.</p> <p class="p2">"Oh," I stammered, surprised and instantly flustered.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Arthur–"</p> <p class="p2">He looked to me, eyes bright and smile shining.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I always knew you'd get us into a suite, Suze."</p> <p class="p2">I watched as the enthusiasm written across his face dissolved, reflecting the scowl overtaking my features.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Arthur, I'm sorry, but–"</p> <p class="p2">He carefully schooled his expression, but couldn't hide the bitterness gathering in the corners of his eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"What is it?" he asked in his best there-can-be-no-problems voice.</p> <p class="p2">"There's only two bunks in the second bedroom," I said, heart sinking.</p> <p class="p2">My ex-husband paused a beat, then shrugged and plastered on another layer of smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Then I guess you and I will have to share."</p> <p class="p2">My head was already shaking no.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Arthur, I already told you, you and I are not–"</p> <p class="p2">"We're not getting back together," he agreed with me, too easily.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The easy agreement he used when repeating back what he knew you wanted to hear.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"It's a queen bed, right?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You won't be using the other half."</p> <p class="p2">Every wisp of compassion gathering in my chest immediately evaporated.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I am not sharing my bed with you, Arthur."</p> <p class="p2">The bitterness in his eyes glinted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Suze.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Come on.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No one else is going to sleep there."</p> <p class="p2">My shoulders knotted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"The only reason I'm not slapping you right now, Arthur, is because you'd fall down."</p> <p class="p2">"What did I say?" he asked, the squint of one eye betraying that he knew exactly what he had said.</p> <p class="p2">"Does it even occur to you," I grated, "that I might want someone else on that side of the bed?"</p> <p class="p2">He actually laughed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"What, someone here?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the refuge?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You think anybody would– oh.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Somebody might put up with that fat ass of yours if it meant becoming a sweetie."</p> <p class="p2">I took two deliberate steps back, knuckles white around the handles of my milk crate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Go reclaim your bunk, Arthur."</p> <p class="p2">The boys were waiting for me at the edge of the floodlights, at the well-practiced distance that put them just out of earshot of their bickering parents.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I gave them a tight, bitter smile and we all filed up the trail to Ponderosa Lodge.</p> <p> </p> <div class="wi_authornotes"> <div> <div class="p-avatar-wrap"><a class="avatar has-link"

                <div class="chp_raw" id="chp_raw"><p class="p2">Sammy had to make Finley wait downstairs while he put on his makeup, breathing very intentionally so he did not rush or mismatch his eyeliner.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That done, he tousled his hair until it looked vaguely correct, and added a few little white clips to keep his bangs under control.</p> <p class="p2">The hiccup came when he went to grab his backpack, which had his wallet and keys in it, and stilled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He couldn’t very well take his backpack on a date.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And the skater dress had no pockets.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Reluctantly, he turned to his closet and pulled out the little white purse that Rowan had insisted he’d need.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Wallet and keys inside, he looped it around his shoulder and scowled into his full-length mirror.</p> <p class="p2">A girl with a purse scowled back at him.</p> <p class="p2">He rolled his eyes at himself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was wearing a polka-dotted dress, sporting flawless if simple makeup, and had two almost-embarassingly-large tits pasted onto his chest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And the purse was the thing giving him pause?</p> <p class="p2">He didn’t have time to parse through these feelings.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He added his lippy to the purse and hurried out the door.</p> <p class="p2">Finley was waiting outside on the dorm’s stoop, leaning against the railing and smiling up at the clear blue summer sky.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The wrap dress they wore was bright green with curls of tie-dye white reaching up from the skirt’s hem.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A few brightly-coloured, chunky necklaces dangled over their chest, under a beard that Sammy suspected had been recently trimmed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Vibrant green eyeshadow and a comparatively muted lipgloss completed their look.</p> <p class="p2">Sammy took his time getting to the door.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He couldn’t help smiling through the window at them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At his date.</p> <p class="p2">Eventually, though, Finley noticed his appraisal, so he had to push open the door and step outside.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Their eyes went a little wide.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You look amazing, Samantha.”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy rolled his eyes and touched his collarbone.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It needs a necklace but I don’t have anything that goes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And I… kind of ran out of time getting ready, worrying about if this was a date or not.”</p> <p class="p2">Finley grinned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Were they amused that Sammy had worried over the evening?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And the verdict is?” they asked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You didn’t actually give me an answer.”</p> <p class="p2">“Oh shit,” Sammy laughed, and reached forward to squeeze their hand in sympathy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Which left him holding Finley’s hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Now what was he supposed to do?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And where had that gesture come from in the first place?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He looked from their joined hands to Finley’s face. “Um.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’d… like it if this were a date.”</p> <p class="p2">He willed himself not to blush.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He failed.</p> <p class="p2">Finley turned their hand to squeeze his.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’d like that, too.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The two of them stood there smiling at each other for what felt like a full minute before the genderqueer tipped their head away from the door.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Shall we?”</p> <p class="p2">Finley had made reservations at a restaurant at the north end of Battery Park, but they took the subway to the south end to have a leisurely walk before dinner.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For most of the way down, the subway was crowded and even when it thinned out enough to permit conversation, they talked about nothing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Classes. Videos they’d seen.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Pizza toppings, inspired by the passenger who boarded with a stack of three very aromatic pizzas.</p> <p class="p2">And then the train reached the end of the line.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They stepped out into the fresh air and the long leafy stretch of the park, and the lazily lapping water alongside it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And out beyond the water…</p> <p class="p2">“Is that—,” Sammy stammered, staring off at the horizon.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It is.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Holy shit.”</p> <p class="p2">Finley looked where he was looking and chuckled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“The Statue of Liberty?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yeah, that’s her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Have you… have you not seen her yet?”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy shook his head and shot a sheepish grin back at them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I guess I just haven’t been where you could see her.”</p> <p class="p2">Finley gestured across the park to where they could get a slightly better view.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The two of them ambled, with Sammy hardly looking at anything else.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You know she’s trans, right?” Finley finally broke their silence to ask.</p> <p class="p2">That got Sammy’s attention, and he looked from the monolithic statue to Finley and back again, confused.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Wait, what?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They’d come up to the railing that separated the park from the Hudson river, and Sammy leaned up against it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“They had trans people back then?”</p> <p class="p2">“Trans people have always been here,” his date chuckled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“But yeah.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Before she was Lady Liberty, she was Sol Invictus, the god of the unconquered sun.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That’s why her crown has sunrays around it.”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy slitted his eyes at Finley skeptically.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Seriously?”</p> <p class="p2">The genderqueer shrugged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“So the story goes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And since she is a story, that’s about as good as we get, right?”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy smirked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I should tell Rowan.”</p> <p class="p2">“Who do you think told me?” Finley laughed, leaning up against the railing, himself.</p> <p class="p2">“It does sound like a Rowan factoid.”</p> <p class="p2">They looked out over the water.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“If I’d had known you hadn’t been out there yet,” mused Finley, “I would have taken you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Distinguish myself with the most memorable first date you’ve ever been on.”</p> <p class="p2">“That’s not exactly a high bar,” Sammy snorted, tearing his eyes away from the statue.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They were heading up the green length of the park, which was… this way.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He started walking, glancing back towards Finley to make sure they were following.</p> <p class="p2">They did so with alacrity.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“What do you mean, not a high bar?”</p> <p class="p2">“I um—” Sammy started, stopped, decided to press on.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He confessed,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’ve never been on a date before.”</p> <p class="p2">Finley’s eyebrows jumped up their forehead.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Oh!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Oh.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They tried to compose their features, but couldn’t completely banish the ghost of a smirk.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“So this is a <i>first date</i> first date.”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy didn’t think they were trying to be condescending, but he decided he wasn’t going to allow it, even accidentally.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He crooked an eyebrow at them. “I don’t know, first date implies that there will be more dates after this one, and if you keep acting like that…”</p> <p class="p2">Finley laughed and threw up their hands to demonstrate their innocence.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Understood.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Understood.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But I’m sure there will be.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>More dates.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Somebody will ask you, or you’ll ask them… emphasis on ‘them.’”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They leaned in to waggle their eyebrows.</p> <p class="p2">Sammy shoved them playfully.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Only if you behave yourself,” he grinned.</p> <p class="p2">But instead of grinning back, Finley looked away and cleared their throat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Well, I don’t have the best track record on that.”</p> <p class="p2">“Okay, no.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sammy shook his head, and reached over to pull Finley back from spiralling away.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I don’t want to rehash that all over again.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You apologized, I accepted, it’s over.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They both walked a few steps before he added, “And apparently I just need to get used to it.”</p> <p class="p2">“No,” Finley leapt to argue so fast they might have sprained something<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Nobody should touch you without your—”</p> <p class="p2">“Not the touching, just the… attention,” Sammy clarified.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m not used to it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And like… I swear I’m not bragging, but you’re not the only one.”</p> <p class="p2">Finley spread a hand across their collarbone.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I have rival suitors?!”</p> <p class="p2">“Oh my god,” Sammy rolled his eyes towards the sky.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“This isn’t fucking Persuasion.”</p> <p class="p2">“I would make a clever literary reference here, but I’m a bio major,” his date admitted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Honestly I’m kind of impressed with myself that I recognized the book title.”</p> <p class="p2">“Yeah well, we’re reading it in Lit class,” Sammy explained.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The park scrolled past them, the sun swollen fat on the horizon painting everything orange.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And there’s a girl there who I bet you money is going to give me moony eyes over it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She already told me if this date doesn’t work out, she’d like to be next in line.”</p> <p class="p2">“I do have rival suitors!”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They pumped their fist as if it was an accomplishment.</p> <p class="p2">Sammy couldn’t help but giggle, but his thoughts kept circling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A few quiet steps later, he sighed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m worried about it being a distraction.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I need to focus on my classes.”</p> <p class="p2">“Well, like you yourself said,” Finley pointed out, “you’re going to need some downtime, too.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Blow off some steam with a little flirting and dating.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Believe me, you can burn yourself out in eight weeks, and you don’t want to do that just in time for the final.”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy made agreeable noises instead of answering and they kept walking.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dating to avoid burnout?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That seemed even less plausible than people hitting on him in class in the first place.</p> <p class="p2">Eventually he realized Finley had not spoken for a while and was in fact watching him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They smirked when he looked up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s not the distraction that’s bothering you, though, is it?” they asked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You seem, like, really frustrated about puzzle pieces that don’t fit together.”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy rolled his eyes to pointedly ignore Finley’s observation, but the genderqueer wasn’t letting go.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They just kept walking alongside him, waiting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sammy told himself that he could ice out Finley right back until they gave up and struck up a different conversation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But they resolutely did no such thing, waiting while Sammy marinated in his own thoughts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Finally his brain boiled over, and he gesticulated into the empty air before him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I mean, I don’t even pass!”</p> <p class="p2">Finley quirked an eyebrow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“What’s passing have to do with it?”</p> <p class="p2">“Cause when they… pay attention to me, they pay attention to me like I’m—” He slapped his chest, a little harder than he meant to, and winced.</p> <p class="p2">They treated him like a girl, even though he wasn’t a girl, and yes he did a whole bunch of things to look more like a girl, but even then he didn’t look all the way like a girl.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He knew what he looked like, and it was not <i>girl</i>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Maybe at first glance, but not after any length of time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He had so many tells.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But they still treated him like they were seeing a girl.</p> <p class="p2">But how to put that into words, especially without admitting to Finley that he wasn’t exactly trans?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Fuck if he knew.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I mean… I just… I don’t see what they see.”</p> <p class="p2">“Is it not enough that they like what they see?” his date asked gently.</p> <p class="p2">Sammy shook his head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“They don’t.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They can’t.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>People look at me and they… they know what they’re looking at.”</p> <p class="p2">“I think they do, yeah,” said Finley, not quite suppressing a chuckle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They reached out to grab Sammy’s hands and pulled him to the side of the walk path, under a leafy tree.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Samantha, listen to me,” they said, voice so earnest that Sammy couldn’t help but look them in the eye.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Passing isn’t important.”</p> <p class="p2">“But—”</p> <p class="p2">But Finley cut them off.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Passing isn’t important,” they repeated, emphasizing each word.</p> <p class="p2">Sammy frowned and looked away, would have scrubbed his face if his hands weren’t trapped.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You think they’re… what do you call them?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Chasers?”</p> <p class="p2">Finley burst out laughing and then scrambled to rein it in, not very successfully.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They squeezed Sammy’s hands before releasing them, and then wiped their own eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I mean… they might be curious.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But that’s a far cry from a chaser.”</p> <p class="p2">Hands freed, Sammy went to rub the heck out of his face.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He remembered just in time that he had makeup on that he didn’t want to muss.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Instead he flexed his hands and wrapped them both around the back of his neck.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Then… what?”</p> <p class="p2">To their credit, Finley’s eyes only dipped down into the cavern of cleavage Sammy was presenting for a moment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then they made very deliberate eye contact and said, “They just think you look hot, Samantha.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I swear.”</p> <p class="p2">He snorted, dismissive.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But he also dropped his arms so his tits weren’t squished together on lewd display.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He had to get better about that.</p> <p class="p2">“You say they know what they’re looking at,” his date pressed, and gently guided the both of them back onto the path along the waterside.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I think you’re right; I think they do.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They know they’re looking at a hot, femme-of-center queer chica.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Further details irrelevant.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Before Sammy could object, they added, “Do they suspect you’re trans?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Maybe.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Embodying some flavor of queer or genderfuckery?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Probably.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But if they’re chatting you up, then they don’t care.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Passing is not a prerequisite for hotness.”</p> <p class="p2">This time Sammy managed to get out a “But—”</p> <p class="p2">“You think I’m a chaser, Samantha?” asked Finley, eyes rhetorically wide.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I don’t just suspect you’re trans, I know you’re trans.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I think that is just one beautiful piece of a much bigger, grander picture.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Are my motives suspect?”</p> <p class="p2">“No, of course not.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All the emotion sluiced out of Sammy, only to replaced a moment later with panic.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Oh shit, you didn’t think I thought—”</p> <p class="p2">Finley smirked, disarming Sammy’s rising anxiety in an instant.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I did not think you thought.”</p> <p class="p2">“Because you’ve always…” he started to say, and then stumbled to a stop.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Closed his eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His big stupid mouth.</p> <p class="p2">When he finally looked back at Finley, their eyebrows bounced up, curious.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Out with it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Finish the sentence.”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy rolled his eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Fine, fuck it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All the cards on the table.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Because you’ve always been into me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even when I looked like I’d fallen through Rowan’s backup closet and landed face-first on her makeup palettes.”</p> <p class="p2">“First of all, that is not what you looked like then,” they retorted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And secondly, and this may be a bit of a tangent but… fucking christ, you really have had a glow-up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m just saying.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You went from noteable country girl visiting the big city to, like, fucking trans diva.”</p> <p class="p2">“Rowan took me shopping,” he said weakly, fingering the hem of his dress.</p> <p class="p2">“Yeah, it’s not just the clothes, Samantha,” Finley laughed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After only a moment, though, the laugh died on his lips.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Oh.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You don’t see it, do you?”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy shrugged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s a costume.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It looks good, but it’s…” Fuck it, he could say what he was thinking without giving away the whole thing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s all façade.”</p> <p class="p2">Finley considered him for some time before answering.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Samantha, it’s not… allow me to revise myself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I don’t think it’s the clothes at all.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Nor is it the… <i>very</i> on-point makeup.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s not the image you present.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There is a light in your eyes, a fucking spring in your step.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An ease in your shoulders that is… incredibly compelling.”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy scowled off across the water instead of responding.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What was Finley seeing?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Maybe his new sense of purpose?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>More likely his twice-daily microdose of party drugs.</p> <p class="p2">“You were cute at Preview Days,” Finley went on.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And also overwhelmed, awkward, and profoundly self-conscious—”</p> <p class="p2">“Thanks.”</p> <p class="p2">“Don’t mention it,” they grinned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“But now you… it’s like you’ve found your spine and you’re standing up straight for the first time in your life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s fucking glorious to watch.”</p> <p class="p2">Compliments on his appearance were one thing; Sammy didn’t even know how to deal with whatever this overblown and patently wrong bullshit was.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I think you’re getting fooled by my Fake It Till You Make It act.”</p> <p class="p2">“I think you’re further along in that process than you think you are,” Finley shot back immediately, a cheeky smirk on his face.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But then he nodded across the street.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They’d come to the end of the park.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“We’re here.”</p> <p class="p2">The restaurant served as the western anchor of what looked like a shopping mall, but also had its own exterior entrance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Finley led Sammy across the street—Andrei would be scandalized—and opened the door for him.</p> <p class="p2">“Thanks,” he said with a small smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was still new to have doors opened for him, even if it only happened a few times a day on campus.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was slowly accepting the fact that for the next couple months, he’d be smiling and thanking helpful men who—oh fuck.</p> <p class="p2">There was another couple in front of them talking to the hostess, so Sammy cleared his throat and said, “So um.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is a dumb question, but like.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You opened the door for me…”</p> <p class="p2">When Sammy trailed off, Finley raised an eyebrow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Is there a question part of your question?”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy gave up trying to phrase it elegantly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Men open doors for women, for manners or whatever, but you’re not a man, so… how’s that work?”</p> <p class="p2">His date grinned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Yeah, non-hetero dating can get confusing sometimes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But there’s usually one half of a couple who likes having the door opened for them more than the other half does.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And in my experience, it’s usually a safe bet that a newly-hatched trans girl will enjoy getting a little chivalry laid at her feet.”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy had to smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Are we that predictable?”</p> <p class="p2">“Follow me for more queer dating tips,” Finley quipped, tapped the side of their nose, and then shrugged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“We can take turns opening doors for each other later, if you like.”</p> <p class="p2">And then the hostess asked for Finley’s reservation and they were being led through the restaurant to a table by the window, overlooking the water.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The sun had almost reached the horizon and the river was all golden sparkles.</p> <p class="p2">“There’s Jersey,” Finley remarked, nodding past the water to the dark, blocky horizon beyond.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Your homeland, right?”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy scoffed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I mean, yeah, that’s Jersey, but it’s not my Jersey.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Like that Real Housewives and Jersey Shore stuff?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I don’t even recognize it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Jersey I know is all backwoods isolation and winding mountain roads.”</p> <p class="p2">Finley settled back in their seat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Tell me about it?” they asked, but were immediately interrupted by the server.</p> <p class="p2">There were a number of specials that the server rattled off from memory—the curse of a seafood place—and the two of them listened to the litany with only slightly strained politeness.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sammy was realizing that, while he liked fish when his mom made it for dinner, he had no idea what kinds of fish she’d ever served him.</p> <p class="p2">“Um, what would you recommend?” he asked when the piscine diatribe drew to a close.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Imagine that I like fish in general but I’ve mysteriously forgotten what all their different names are.”</p> <p class="p2">Did the server flinch?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sammy knew his question was odd, but that seemed like an extreme reaction.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But she recovered quickly to recommend the tuna steak.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That sounded straightforward so he ordered that, along with a diet soda.</p> <p class="p2">Finley put in his order, the server retreated, and they were alone.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“That’s an interesting mysterious ailment you have, forgetting the names of fish.”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy rolled his eyes at himself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“My mom makes fish all the time and I love it, but like.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I say, ‘hey Mom, what’s for dinner?’ and she tells me the name of the fish, and I look at her confused and stuff and then she just says, ‘Fish.’<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So I nod and then dinner is delicious.”</p> <p class="p2">Finley grinned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Don’t go out for seafood much in the Jersey backwoods?”</p> <p class="p2">“No, Oak Grove has got, like… a diner, a chinese takeout place, a pizza place, and, um, this place that calls itself a ‘grill’ but it serves exactly the same stuff as the diner.”</p> <p class="p2">“What, no fast food?”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy shrugged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Not unless you want to drive all the way to Dover.”</p> <p class="p2">Finley whistled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Wow, you really do live outside of civilization.”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy lifted a finger.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Used to live outside of civilization.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Now I live in New York City.”</p> <p class="p2">“Never going back?”</p> <p class="p2">He shook his head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Not if I can help it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I mean, go back for visits and stuff, sure.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But that’s the people.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ll miss people.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I won’t miss Oak Grove.”</p> <p class="p2">Finley nodded. “I get that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I miss my family, definitely, but I gotta admit, sometimes I miss home, the place.”</p> <p class="p2">The server reappeared with their drinks and a basket of bread.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sammy thanked her and waited until she’d left to ask, “Where is home again?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You said back during Preview Days but I was overwhelmed and awkward.”</p> <p class="p2">Finley stuck their tongue out before answering, “Nebraska.” Sammy nodded.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That sounded like something he’d been told months ago.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“A sleepy little suburb called Waverly, outside of Lincoln.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Flat as hell.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Green in the summer, white in the winter.”</p> <p class="p2">“And you miss it?”</p> <p class="p2">“I miss bits,” they nodded.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Outdoor seating at the Runza that looked out over a field.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The creek where my friends and I hung out.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My favourite club down in Lincoln.”</p> <p class="p2">“What’s a Runza?”</p> <p class="p2">“Sandwich place,” Finley clarified with a shrug.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Fast food, because Waverly sits within the bounds of proper civilization.”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy gestured with his buttered roll, plainly egging Finley on, because apparently he liked listening to the genderqueer talk.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“So you miss a fast food sandwich with a view across a green field leading to a flat horizon.”</p> <p class="p2">Finley smirked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Yeah.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I do.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They described a particularly memorable summer day with friends, hanging out at the sandwich place, and Sammy just listened, smiling softly and making encouraging conversational noises every once in a while.</p> <p class="p2">When their food came, Sammy’s didn’t look much like any fish his mother had ever served him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But he figured he was trying new experiences and dug in.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The tuna steak was surprisingly good.</p> <p class="p2">His date was less than enamored with their food.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Despite trying to hide their disappointment, they finally admitted that the upscale restaurant’s mojo isleño sauce paled in comparison to their mother’s home cooking.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I had a little spark of hope when I saw Puerto Rican food on the menu, but I should have known better,” they sighed.</p> <p class="p2">Sammy made sympathetic noises and got two more bites into his own steak before his curiousity piqued.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Are there a lot of Puerto Ricans in Nebraska?”</p> <p class="p2">“Not really,” Finley answered.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“There’s, like, almost a real Boricua community in Omaha, but not in Lincoln.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Certainly not in Waverly.”</p> <p class="p2">“Boricuwhat?”</p> <p class="p2">“Boricua,” Finley grinned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s just what Puerto Ricans call ourselves.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I should be able to tell you why but um.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I really have no idea.”</p> <p class="p2">“Well there’s no Boricua community in Nebraska,” Sammy pointed out, dimly proud of himself when he didn’t stumble over the new word.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Who would have taught you, right?”</p> <p class="p2">His date guffawed at that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I am, if you can believe it, third-generation Nebraskan Boricua.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My great-grandparents moved there when they were discharged after World War Two.”</p> <p class="p2">“They were?” Sammy echoed, eyebrows raised.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Not just him?”</p> <p class="p2">“Women’s Auxiliary,” they answered with no small amount of pride.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“She was a mechanic, he was a driver.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They met in Italy, got secretly married in London a year before the war was over.”</p> <p class="p2">“Secretly married?”</p> <p class="p2">They grinned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You weren’t supposed to get married, it would distract you from your important work fixing jeeps.”</p> <p class="p2">“That’s so awesome,” Sammy grinned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The back of his brain told him that the story might have been mildly amusing, but certainly didn’t qualify as ‘so awesome.’ The rest of his brain, which was now sure it just liked listening to Finley talk, told the back to shut up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And then they chose Nebraska.”</p> <p class="p2">“Nobody on the east coast was giving brown people mortgages under the G.I. Bill, so they had to go inland,” they explained, wrinkling their nose.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“But it worked out, I guess.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They opened a garage in Lincoln; my grandpa worked there his whole life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My mom worked there part-time through college.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She’s an accountant, now.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Terribly exciting.”</p> <p class="p2">“And the garage?” Sammy asked, thinking about his family’s patchwork collection of small businesses in Oak Grove.</p> <p class="p2">“It’s my uncle’s now.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mom moved out to Waverly to be closer to her clients.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All agribusiness stuff.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Taxes for farms are complicated, apparently.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But it kept us housed and clothed and fed, so I’m not complaining.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They grinned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“My mom is complaining, but more about the farmers and their bookkeeping practices than the tax codes.”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy hesitated only a moment before asking, “Single mom?”</p> <p class="p2">“Sometimes, not always,” they answered without hesitation, and then smiled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Had me when she was on her own; IVF.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These days she’s shacked up with a girl named Tiff who’s like half her age.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s kind of adorable.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She asked me a couple months ago if it would be weird for me if they got married.”</p> <p class="p2">“What did you say?”</p> <p class="p2">Finley took a moment to chew, swallow, and wash down the disappointing fish sauce with a gulp of water.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I told her, ‘you’re not going to find another <i>lesbiana boricua</i> in Lincoln. You better lock that shit down while you can.’”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy tried not to wince when Finley slipped into Spanish, which he didn’t speak, but the meaning was clear enough.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He grinned to cover the sudden spike of unease.</p> <p class="p2">Finley just asked, “What about your family, Samantha?”</p> <p class="p2">“Oh, not as exciting,” he demurred.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But then his brain railed against his own words: Now it’s your turn, now you have to be interesting to listen to, and tell a good story, and be engaging and clever.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You’re on a <i>date</i>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So Sammy cleared his throat and said,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“My dad’s side has been in Oak Grove since, like, time immemorial.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They probably fought the British during the Revolution.”</p> <p class="p2">Finley grinned at that, but the expression took a moment to hit their face, as if it wasn’t quite genuine.</p> <p class="p2">Sammy suspected what was going through his date’s head, so he forced himself not to smirk as he set up a sort of conversational surprise.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“My mom’s family… they’re more recent immigrants.”</p> <p class="p2">At this, Finley nodded and the trace of hesitation in their face faded.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“From where?”</p> <p class="p2">“Russia,” he answered, and Finley visibly flinched.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sammy grinned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“What, don’t I look like I’m half Sons of Liberty, half Pushkin heroine?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He only remembered to add the ‘-ine’ at the last moment and wasn’t even sure if there were Daughters of Liberty that he should have referenced, but Finley did not seem to notice.</p> <p class="p2">“Respectfully, Samantha, you do not,” Finley laughed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Is there a story there?”</p> <p class="p2">“Not really,” he said, shrugged, and tamped down a rising tide of panic.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He should have planned further ahead; now he was heading into fraught territory.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m adopted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A foundling left on the steps of a fire department in Jersey City.”</p> <p class="p2">Finley hooked a thumb out the window, at the twinkling skyline across the water.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“So you are from over there, after all.”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy snorted softly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Only technically.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My parents adopted me as a baby; I only remember Oak Grove.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He looked down at the remnants of his tuna steak, picking the flake apart with his fork.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The conversation lulled, and he felt compelled to fill the silence, even if it would bring down the mood.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s not like I was the only brown kid in Oak Grove, but… it was close.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And none of the Martinezes or the Sozas had kids my age, so.”</p> <p class="p2">Finley reached across the table to put their hand over his, and had the good sense not to say anything.</p> <p class="p2">Eventually Sammy turned his hand over to clasp Finley’s, and they sat in silence—companionable, not stilted—as the red sun sank behind the Jersey City skyline.</p> <p class="p2">After dinner, Finley suggested they walk to a nearby ice cream place.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sammy was more than eager to make the date last longer, so he grinned and said he was never going to turn down ice cream.</p> <p class="p2">They left the restaurant by a different entrance, connecting into the mall.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Finley held open the door to the brightly-lit thoroughfare.</p> <p class="p2">Sammy hesitated.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I thought we were going to take turns opening doors for each other?”</p> <p class="p2">His date grinned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Yeah, but you like this.”</p> <p class="p2">He considered protesting, but a beat later stepped through, cheeks burning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sammy wasn’t about to admit anything out loud, but something deep within him blossomed warm and giddy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He did like it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not because he was a newly-hatched trans girl, of course, because he wasn’t that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Finley had said one half of the couple usually liked that sort of thing, and maybe he was that half of this couple.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was okay with that.</p> <p class="p2">He probably should not be thinking of himself and Finley as a couple, he realized, and flushed even more.</p> <p class="p2">They ambled along the mall walkway without talking, but Sammy slowly became aware that Finley was less comfortable with the arrangement than he was.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The genderqueer was tapping their fingers on their thighs, looking furtively at Sammy and then away.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Were they actually nervous?</p> <p class="p2">He leaned sideways to bump his shoulder against their upper arm.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Okay, now it’s my turn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Out with it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Say the thing you keep not saying.”</p> <p class="p2">“You got me,” they sighed, and then held their hand out, towards Sammy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’d like to slip my arm around your waist as we walk.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But I don’t want to presume, for obvious reasons, so I need to ask…”</p> <p class="p2">“Oh my god,” Sammy giggled, and stepped closer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Finley’s hand slid across his back and settled against his far hip.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He mirror imaged his own arm around Finley and squeezed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His head tipped against their shoulder, just for a moment, which felt wonderful.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“This is nice,” he murmured.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And thank you for asking.”</p> <p class="p2">“You didn’t actually let me get to the asking part,” his date pointed out, and added playfully, “Nor did you ask me—”</p> <p class="p2">“Finley, shut up and enjoy this.”</p> <p class="p2">“Yes, ma’am.”</p> <p class="p2">They walked the length of the mall like that, talking only sporadically and about nothing of import.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sammy could get used to… whatever this was.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A walking hug?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And Finley was smart and funny and charming, and something about their arm around him made Sammy feel… safe wasn’t the right word.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Taken care of?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Like Finley thought Sammy was worth holding onto—something special—and they weren’t shy about demonstrating it to everybody they passed in the mall.</p> <p class="p2">Sammy’s musing was interrupted when Finley said, “Ooo!” and used their walking hug to steer them both into a hard ninety-degree turn, plunging directly into a store decorated in purple and pink.</p> <p class="p2">“What’s happening?” Sammy asked, just slightly panicked, as they were suddenly surrounded by plastic teenybopper jewelry on all sides.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Where are we?”</p> <p class="p2">“Claire’s,” Finley answered cheerfully, and disengaged their arm from Sammy’s side.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He tried not to pout.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m going to go out on a limb and guess that Rowan didn’t bring you here during your shopping spree.”</p> <p class="p2">“Uh, no.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Isn’t this place for, like, twelve-year-olds?”</p> <p class="p2">“Twelve-year-olds and working class queers,” Finley corrected with a smirk. They grabbed Sammy’s hand and dragged him between the display racks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s not that Rowan has no appreciation for trash fashion, she just prefers designer trash fashion.”</p> <p class="p2">“So we’re shopping, now?” Sammy asked, bemusedly allowing himself to be pulled through the claustrophobic store.</p> <p class="p2">“Just for one quick thing,” Finley promised.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I thought I saw it through the window—ah, here.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They plucked something off a rack and tore its cardboard holder apart.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sammy could mostly see wide black ribbon.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Turn around?”</p> <p class="p2">More than a little unsure, Sammy turned his back on Finley.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A moment later, their hands passed over his shoulders and exposed collarbones, fiddled for a heartbeat, and then laid the cool, plasticky necklance against his skin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Fingertips brushed the side of Sammy’s neck, and then they were fastening the clasp behind him.</p> <p class="p2">“There,” Finley said proudly, and with their hands on Sammy’s shoulders, turned him to face a mirror.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Now your outfit is complete.”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy’s immediate “oh, that’s right, I look like a girl” reaction blossomed as he took in his reflection, but over the last week it had been worn down to little more than half a second.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So he focused on the necklace that Finley had put on him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was simple—a wide black ribbon supporting an oversized white plastic cameo—and if he looked close as he was now, it was plainly cheap.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But this last week had also shown him that most of humanity did little more than glance at their fellows, and he doubted anyone would think really think poorly about him wearing a plastic pendant.</p> <p class="p2">And it did complete the outfit rather nicely.</p> <p class="p2">…even if it did draw attention down into his fake cleavage.</p> <p class="p2">“It looks good, yeah,” he told Finley, and put on a smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Something tugged at his memory, though, and he scrutinized his reflection for a little longer, and finally laughed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In his blue skater dress, black hair in a swishy bob, and now this necklace…<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I look like Betty Rubble.”</p> <p class="p2">“Like a hot Betty Rubble, sure,” Finley grinned back through the mirror.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A trace of uncertainly flickered acoss their features.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You like it, though?”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy touched the generic figure on the cameo and nodded.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I do, actually.”</p> <p class="p2">Finley waved the cardboard backing the necklace had come from.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Okay, let me go pay for it.”</p> <p class="p2">“You’re buying me jewelry on our first date?” Sammy smirked through the mirror, raising one arch eyebrow.</p> <p class="p2">Finley checked the back of the cardboard.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I mean, I’m spending eight dollars, here,” they grinned, and disappeared behind the displays.</p> <p class="p2">Sammy looked back at his reflection.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The necklace might be cheap plastic and ribbon, but it worked with everything else perfectly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He stepped back, fitting his reflection into the thin display mirror.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Leaving his dorm room, he’d felt thrown together and rushed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Now he looked poised and put together.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Was it the addition of the necklace, or just fewer nerves?</p> <p class="p2">Sammy really wanted it to be the latter option, because Finley had been careful, sweet, and gentle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was having such a good time, and he was a lot less worried about how the date might go, now that it was mostly over.</p> <p class="p2">But if he was being honest with himself, he was pretty sure the outfit was the larger part of his looking better.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If only he could swap out these little earring studs he was stuck with for something that properly complemented the necklace…</p> <p class="p2">Finley returned, slipping a thin billfold into the pocket of their dress.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sammy tamped down a sharp flash of envy; where had they got a sleek dress with pockets? The genderqueer met Sammy’s eyes in the mirror and held their hands out over his hips, question plain on their face.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sammy smiled, and Finley’s hands settled over his hips comfortably.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He leaned back against them.</p> <p class="p2">His date dropped their chin onto Sammy’s shoulder.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Ice cream?”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy placed his hands over Finley’s, squeezing softly in the hopes of silently communicating how the contact had been nice and his date should do it again.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With actual spoken words, he said, “Oooo, ice cream.”</p> <p class="p2">The ice cream place was out the far end of the mall and a half-block down the street beyond that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Despite the sun setting almost an hour ago, it was still warm out and Sammy had been happy that they’d exploited the mall’s air conditioning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was also, somehow, less crowded in the mall.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Now they had to dodge pedestrians on the last leg to the creamery, and holding hands was off the table.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sammy contented himself with frequent shoulder bumps.</p> <p class="p2">“It’s not the most prestigious medical school,” Finley was saying, “and not even the most prestigious school that I got accepted to.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They just put together a better financial aid package for me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ll still be in debt for decades, but you know… one decade fewer sounds nice.”</p> <p class="p2">“Finley in sunny California,” Sammy grinned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“When do you go?”</p> <p class="p2">“I move out of my apartment August 12<span class="s1"><sup>th</sup></span>,” came the answer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Lease is up then, so it’s convenient.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ll head home for a bit… Mom wants me there till the last minute, like three weeks, but I think I need some time to settle in before things start getting hectic.”</p> <p class="p2">“That sounds like a good idea, yeah,” Sammy grinned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Home in small doses, even if it has a Runza with a view.”</p> <p class="p2">“What about you, what are your plans?”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy shrugged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I mean, I go home after the final exam, and then hopefully I’m back here a month later.”</p> <p class="p2">“You will be,” Finley nodded encouragingly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You’re gonna crush it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But I mean in broader strokes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Major?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Grad school plans?”</p> <p class="p2">“Oh gosh, that’s so many steps ahead,” he said, shaking his head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I don’t have any plans beyond ‘get into Columbia.’<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Anything more concrete seems like setting myself up for disappointment.”</p> <p class="p2">“There’s no rush,” his date insisted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And honestly, I think spending some time figuring out what you want to study and what you want to do after school… that’s a good thing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or maybe I just hang out with too many pre-meds who are super focused on—”</p> <p class="p2">“Hey Tranny!” The shout cut through the humid, acrid air from across the street.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Finley rolled their eyes.</p> <p class="p2">Sammy moved to turn, but Finley grabbed his arm to still him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Don’t even turn around.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Come on.”</p> <p class="p2">He didn’t turn, so he scowled at his date instead.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“If somebody’s gonna shout slurs at me on the street, I want to flip him off at least.”</p> <p class="p2">The man shouted across the street again, this time backed by other voices laughing.</p> <p class="p2">“He’s not shouting at you, Samantha,” Finley told him with a wan smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With their arm around Sammy, they hastened their pace down the street.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“His idea of a tranny is somebody wearing a beard and a dress at the same time.”</p> <p class="p2">“Hey chica!” came the next shout.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Ditch the tranny and come on over here.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ll show you what a real man is like!”</p> <p class="p2">Finley tipped their head slightly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Okay, now he’s shouting at you.”</p> <p class="p2">“Does that mean I can flip him off?”</p> <p class="p2">“I wouldn’t recommend it,” they answered, pulled open a storefront door, and guided Sammy inside.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“They’re probably harmless, but you never know.”</p> <p class="p2">In the process of turning and stepping into the ice cream shop, Sammy cast a hasty glance back down the street.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The view was complicated by a tide of moving vehicles and a wash of pedestrians on the sidewalk opposite.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But the culprit was most likely the scruffy-looking man in tattered clothing, leaning on a lightpost and leering across the street at them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If whoever had laughed along with him had stuck around, Sammy couldn’t spot them.</p> <p class="p2">“He looks homeless,” he reported to Finley in a whisper.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The ice cream shop was tightly packed with display refrigerators blasting hot air out along the floor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A rainbow of colours beckoned to them, but another couple was ahead of them, being helped by the sole worker.</p> <p class="p2">“Might be,” his date said with a shrug.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Not getting my sympathy today, though.”</p> <p class="p2">“Yeah,” he answered weakly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The couple ahead of them were taking their time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Seems weird, though, that he thinks a trans girl would wear a beard.”</p> <p class="p2">“I mean, some do,” Finley shrugged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“But it’s more that… he saw something different than he expected, it had something to do with gender presentation, and he’s only got one word to apply to that situation.”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy made an agreeable sound, and then it was their turn to pick flavours.</p> <p class="p2">Later, hunched around one of the two tiny little tables in the front of the store and halfway through their dessert, Sammy said, “Hey um.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Can I ask a question about… I mean it’s not really about the guy outside, but it’s sort of… tangentially related?”</p> <p class="p2">His date made a show of calculated deliberation, and then pointed their spoon at Sammy’s ice cream.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Only if you give me a bite of that lemon curd swirl.”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy scooped out a generous spoonful and held it out to Finley, who grinned before slurping it up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Good, right?” he smiled, and then switched tack.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“He thought you were transgender, yeah, but… I don’t know how to ask this right but… are you?”</p> <p class="p2">“You mean, do I self-identify as transgender,” his date rephrased for him, and bobbed their head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s a good question. Wish I had a good answer.”</p> <p class="p2">“Well if you’re not going to give me the answer I paid for,” Sammy smirked, “it seems like you owe me a bite of ice cream.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He leaned forward slightly and watched Finley’s eyes wobble down and snap back up, not quite taking the bait of cleavage that Sammy had put on display.</p> <p class="p2">“It’s good chocolate,” Finley said, and scooped out a bite of theirs to hold forward.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Not as good as your lemon curd, though.”</p> <p class="p2">After sampling the bite, Sammy tipped his head side to side.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m not sure I agree with your ranking, there.”</p> <p class="p2">“You want to swap?”</p> <p class="p2">“No,” Sammy smiled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“But I think I do need another bite, just to make sure.”</p> <p class="p2">“That so?”</p> <p class="p2">“I can make it worth your while,” he proposed in a soft, tempting drawl that surprised even him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then he dangled his spoon, lumped high with yellow ice cream, between them.</p> <p class="p2">“Well,” Finley smirked, and prepared their own spoonful.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“In the interest of rigorous testing.”</p> <p class="p2">The two of them traded bites back and forth for a few minutes, which inevitably resulted in melted ice cream on the tips of both of their noses.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And then as both their paper bowls neared empty, Finley said, “So like, definitionally, I am transgender.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My realized gender does not match the gender I was assigned at birth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So yeah, I’m trans.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Technically.”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy nodded, accepting the belated answer and sudden return to the previous topic because, well, he wanted to know.</p> <p class="p2">“But, like, colloquially?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Finley grimaced.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“There’s a picture of what people think of when they think of transgender people, and I share… only some of those characteristics and experiences, you know?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I will never pass.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact I am trying, every day, not to pass.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As either binary gender.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So I don’t know if it’s a useful label in most contexts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m happy just claiming genderqueer and leaving it at that.”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy bobbed his head and held forward his spoon with the last of the lemon curd.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“That’s a good answer.”</p> <p class="p2">“I’m glad we got to do this,” Finley said as the two of them approached Sammy’s dorm, steps slowing to prolong the tail end of the date.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The long summer day had finally surrendered to darkness, not that the humid heat had gone anywhere.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Campus was lit up around them, floodlights spilling across red brick and up alabaster columns.</p> <p class="p2">“Me too,” Sammy murmured, and leaned his head against their shoulder.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’d maneuvered them into a walking hug when the dorm came into view, savoring the contact.</p> <p class="p2">“I really enjoyed getting to know you better,” they continued, and then grinned down at him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And I’m glad you decided to make it a date.”</p> <p class="p2">“I didn’t decide that!”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sammy recoiled, a little more affronted than he wanted to be.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I decided that I’d like it to be a date.” He poked Finley’s shoulder.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You decided it was a date when you asked me out on a date.”</p> <p class="p2">“Is that what I did?” they asked, all skepticism and cheek.</p> <p class="p2">“You may have played it cool when I asked if it was a date,” Sammy argued, trying to play it off as funny.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Why did this suddenly matter so much?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“But we both know what you were doing.”</p> <p class="p2">They came to the foot of the stairs up to the dorm’s front door, and their steps came to a halt.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Plausible.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Certainly sounds like something I’d do,” Finley said, and then their performative musing cracked into a devilish smirk.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“So.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Since this is and always was a date… may I kiss you goodnight?”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy turned to face his date, slipped his arms around their waist, and smiled up at them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Please.”</p> <p class="p2">Finley mirrored his smile, then slid one hand up his back until their fingers nestled into the hairs at the nape of Sammy’s neck.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They drew him close and gently pressed their lips together.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Soft and warm.</p> <p class="p2">Sammy felt his eyes flutter closed more than he shut them with any intention.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Finley was taking their time, with slow, light kisses along his lips.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He pulled the genderqueer closer and might have made a little quavering sound he’d feel ashamed of if he wasn’t presently consumed by sensation.</p> <p class="p2">And then Finley was pulling away gently, which brought out of Sammy a frustrated little squeal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This wasn’t over, not yet!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He stood up on tip-toes to push his face into theirs, parting his lips to plant a little, inviting lick on Finley’s lower lip.</p> <p class="p2">The movement unbalanced him and he wobbled slightly—damn sandals—but his date caught him with the simple expedience of their free hand cupped under his butt, holding him close.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sammy giggled into the kiss; he could feel Finley’s lips curl into a responding smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lips parted; tongues darted; Sammy started to run out of breath.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He didn’t particularly care.</p> <p class="p2">Eventually, though, Finley set him back down on solid ground.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They pulled back, and this time Sammy’s head was spinning too fast to mount a bodily counter-argument.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His date nodded up the short stack of stairs behind Sammy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s slightly more pragmatic chivalry than holding restaurant doors open, but I’d like to see you safely through your front door before I head home.”</p> <p class="p2">Sammy nodded absently; that made sense.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He staggered up the steps, fished keys out of his purse, and managed to get onto the other side of the glass door.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It latched and locked with an audible kerthunk.</p> <p class="p2">Through the glass, Finley waved; without thinking, Sammy blew them a kiss.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He watched them turn and go, heart pounding.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At some point, after Finley was long out of sight, he rested his forehead against the door.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Oh, this is bad,” he sighed to himself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“So much for no distractions.”</p> <div class="wi_authornotes"> <div> <div

                <!-- Intentionally not escaping for html context -->
                <div class="chp_raw" id="chp_raw"><p class="p2">Meanwhile, Maggie and I continued to expand our fledgling network.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I managed a one-on-one with another poolie every day or two, usually just chatting over work or at lunch.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>People leapt at the chance to tell their stories after weeks of being little more than a body forced into labor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sharing histories and experiences felt like becoming human again.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It took the barest nudge to get them started, and then the stories started flowing out.</p> <p class="p2">Barry was a city comptroller and wild for civil war reenactment; he actually signed up for the refuge with other "soldiers" in his "unit."<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He wasn't sure if they didn't keep up with the subscription or if they just hadn't made it up the mountain once things went south.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His wife blamed him for bringing their family to the refuge; it could not be any worse out there than it was in here, she insisted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He wasn't sure about that, but when I suggested that conditions inside the refuge could be improved, he was all ears.</p> <p class="p2">Felicity had always loved the mountains and living in "the bosom of nature's abundance."<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She'd signed on with the refuge as a sort of wilderness timeshare, letting her come camp and learn on weekends.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Abernathy had been a big draw for her, and I'd crossed paths with her on many seminars and retreats.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But at those events I hadn't learned that she practiced environmental law, operated a Clean the Bay non-profit, and had inherited one-third of a ubiquitous fast food chain along with her two brothers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They refused to buy her out, and so the trade in saturated fat fueled her efforts to clean up the rest of the planet.</p> <p class="p2">Mischa spoke little English, and so most of our conversations went through his eight-year-old daughter Trina.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As best I could tell, Mischa had acquired controlling interest in a number of oil fields, then banks, and eventually a television station.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was never quite certain how he had come to head up such an impressive business empire; before he was a mogul, his daughter explained, he had been "a soldier."<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But then he had run afoul of the powers-that-be.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He liquidated what he could and fled his home country.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Life as an international financier was harder—I got the impression that he had been losing money since he'd fled—but all that came to an abrupt end a few months ago.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He laughed as he explained that even though his subscription was an artifact of his refugee paranoia, in the end it had paid off.</p> <p class="p2">Maggie found the one-on-ones harder to pull off, through some mix of inexperience and already burned bridges.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>People were less eager to trust her, knowing her own sordid history and predilection for talking like a caricature of Che Guevara.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But she pushed past their suspicions of her ulterior motives and talked, sharing her own story as much as getting theirs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We shared notes and pointed each other to those poolies who showed the most potential for taking action.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Maggie did her best, but she was always impatient.</p> <p class="p2">"We've worked our way through half of the labor pool," she groused over the tub she was scrubbing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"When are we going to actually do something?"</p> <p class="p2">"Half of Ponderosa's labor pool," I corrected mildly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We had swapped out parts of the water reclamation apparatus with spares and were now cleaning out the parts that had been in use for the past month.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"At some point we'll need to figure out how to make contacts outside our lodge."</p> <p class="p2">"Yeah, well maybe if we do something," Maggie repeated, "they'll take notice and come to us."</p> <p class="p2">I transferred my tub into the rinse bin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"We do something public and more than just poolies will take notice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Once the sweeties find out we're organizing, they will move to stop us."</p> <p class="p2">"Bring it," she growled at the lime caked along the rim of a glass reservoir.</p> <p class="p2">"These are the sweeties that walk around with guns on their hips, Maggie," I reminded.</p> <p class="p2">"Those are for show," she sniffed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Most of them couldn't hit a barn door."</p> <p class="p2">I paused in my scrubbing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"It doesn't take a great amount of skill to fire into a crowd of people.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And I think you underestimate how eager some of those sweeties are to use the guns they've been carrying around for months."</p> <p class="p2">She waved her scrub brush.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"So we do something not public.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So they won't find out."</p> <p class="p2">I watched her for a long moment, long enough that she felt my eyes on her and looked up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Tell me what you're thinking about," I asked when our eyes met.</p> <p class="p2">Maggie shrugged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I don't know, I'm not the expert, here.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A… rally?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We all get together and see how many of us are sick of things and… I just think it would do us good.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Right now we're all so isolated."</p> <p class="p2">I exhaled, trying not to show my relief.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I'd half expected her to suggest some sort of midnight sabotage–something violent and dangerous.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In comparison, a rally was downright reasonable.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"So a meeting," I said, musing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At her nod, I moderated, "Not everyone we've spoken with, or even everyone we've flagged as potentials, are ready for that sort of commitment."</p> <p class="p2">"So we just invite the ones who are ready."</p> <p class="p2">I nodded thoughtfully.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"We could do something like that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Just gather in one corner of the Mess some Sunday afternoon."</p> <p class="p2">"Next Sunday afternoon," Maggie corrected.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"This coming Sunday afternoon."</p> <p class="p2">I couldn't help but chuckle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I doubt anyone will have prior commitments or schedule conflicts."</p> <p class="p2">"We get together, we put names to faces for everybody else," Maggie said, riffing with growing excitement, "we tell some stories, air our complaints, maybe vent a little frustration, and… talk about a way forward."</p> <p class="p2">That last set off my alarm bells.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"A way forward?" I prompted.</p> <p class="p2">"Stuff we can do," she answered readily.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I dunno, strike?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Figure out how to target the worst of the sweeties, get them demoted to labor pool?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It's happened before, we can make it happen on purpose.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or hell, figure out how to get our hands on some of those guns."</p> <p class="p2">And there it was.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Maggie–" I started, exasperated, and then realized I didn't know what to say next.</p> <p class="p2">"You don't think we're going to need guns of our own at some point?" she challenged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"We won't change this place singing kum bay ya."</p> <p class="p2">I held up a placating hand as I gathered my thoughts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I am enough of a realist to acknowledge that it may come to violence," I admitted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I hope it won't.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I will always strive to find a peaceful solution.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But you are right–at some point, we may need guns.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We are not at that point yet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We are nowhere near that point yet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And stealing guns and hiding them is far more complicated and dangerous than we're capable of pulling off right now."</p> <p class="p2">Maggie was quiet in response, intent on scrubbing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I couldn't tell if her scowl was for me or whatever she was trying to scrape off the inside of the tub.</p> <p class="p2">"Can you imagine, how fucked we would be," I pushed, "if we made a mistake there?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If we got caught?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If somebody got shot?"</p> <p class="p2">My co-conspirator reluctantly nodded.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I suppose.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But what do we do in the mean time?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How do we get to the point that we can start considering that kind of action?"</p> <p class="p2">"Well we start with this meeting," I told her. "I think it's a great idea. You're right; we are isolated.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Seeing that we're not alone will do us some real good.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We can compare notes and get a better idea of what's happening all around us."</p> <p class="p2">"We're being worked like slaves by idiots masquerading as feudal lords," Maggie grumbled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"What's complicated about that?"</p> <p class="p2">"Any system gets complicated when you look at it close enough," I told her, feeling like I was back in my classroom.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I shook it off.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Like the cabins."</p> <p class="p2">That got her attention.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"What about the cabins?"</p> <p class="p2">"We laid foundation the other day and I sunk the heating and cooling loop with the Director."</p> <p class="p2">"Came down off his lofty perch, huh?"</p> <p class="p2">I tipped my head side to side. "I got the feeling he gets pretty hands-on on a regular basis.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It's not like we see how Golden Eagle works on the day-to-day."</p> <p class="p2">"I can tell you, Beaver Lodge works exactly like we do, just with more pressure to squeeze performance out of labor pool."<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then she waved her hands.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"But you were talking about the cabins."</p> <p class="p2">"Yeah, and the thing of it is," I went on, "those cabins aren't going to house a lot of people."</p> <p class="p2">Maggie paused in her scrubbing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Like how many?"</p> <p class="p2">"It's hard to say," I admitted, "but they're not much bigger than a pair of suites.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Maybe four bedrooms?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If we put a family of four in each bedroom, we'd need to build twelve cabins just for Ponderosa.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Expand that to the whole refuge, that's sixty cabins.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And it's not like the population actually breaks down into convenient four-person families like that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We'd probably need twice as many until it's actually families in bedrooms and not random groupings of people."</p> <p class="p2">"Yeah, I think your boys are great and all, but I'm in no rush to make them roommates."</p> <p class="p2">"So a hundred cabins?" I pressed on.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Even assuming we have the materials on-site and enough room for one hundred build sites–and I doubt that a great deal–it's taken Ponderosa six weeks to get one cabin half done and two more foundations dug.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even if we speed up with experience, that’s at least a year for twelve cabins, assuming the other lodges are progressing like us. Take winter into account, and a conservative estimate says it's a year and a half until we have cabins for everybody."</p> <p class="p2">"Mother fucker," Maggie breathed.</p> <p class="p2">"Even if we get better and faster," I went on, "and this is still assuming we can dig up that many rocks and fell that many trees, it's at least a year before we're done.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And the Hosts aren't stupid.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They've got far more information than we do, and they can do math."</p> <p class="p2">The woman scowled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"You're getting at something but I'm still reeling at a year of grueling labor."</p> <p class="p2">"The Hosts know that the cabins won't solve the poolie housing problem.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not any time soon.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So the question becomes: what is the actual purpose of the cabins building project?"</p> <p class="p2">Maggie stared at me for some time before repeating herself: "Mother Fucker!"</p> <p class="p2">Maggie tried to go back to scrubbing and found she couldn't.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I bet they're for the Hosts," she spat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Have you seen the little cubbyholes they've got to live in?"</p> <p class="p2">"If they were for Hosts, we wouldn't be building one for Abernathy," I pointed out.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"He likes his cubbyhole, been living in it for years already.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And besides, we're building three, and the other lodges are supposed to be ahead of us, so even more."</p> <p class="p2">"For sweeties, then," Maggie revised without missing a beat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Because the suites they're in aren't good enough for their delicate sensibilities."</p> <p class="p2">I refrained from mentioning her own delicate sensibilities which she'd indulged in a lothario's suite for a few weeks.</p> <p class="p2">"And when sweeties move into a cabin, that frees up a suite," she continued with the renewed vigor of fresh injustice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Which the Hosts use as an incentive to keep us poolies in line.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Favorites get promoted to the lodge.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So poolies, then sweeties, then whatever we call the fucks in the cabins, and the Hosts on top.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They've got this whole caste system game nailed."</p> <p class="p2">"I'm not sure they're that intentional about it," I moderated, even as I remembered Cole talking about "building culture."</p> <p class="p2">"They're entirely intentional about this," Maggie insisted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"It's just like the empty suite in Beaver lodge."</p> <p class="p2">I blinked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"The what, now?"</p> <p class="p2">"The empty suite in Beaver," Maggie repeated, and actually started scrubbing again. "Have you not heard of this?"<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When I shook my head, she explained: "Clark keeps one of her suites empty, just waiting for the right subscribers to prove themselves worthy of it."</p> <p class="p2">"Seriously?" I asked, incredulous.</p> <p class="p2">Maggie snapped her chin up and down in one sharp nod.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I've seen it."</p> <p class="p2">"And it's not… damaged, or its bathrooms' broken or something?" I suggested, groping for some reasonable explanation.</p> <p class="p2">"Aw, aren't you cute, trying to find an excuse for them," she sneered.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"No, Polyanna, it's a perfectly functional suite.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I tried the taps, and…" She faltered for a moment, then pushed on through.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I can attest the bed works just fine, too."</p> <p class="p2">Maggie fell silent after that, no doubt reliving old betrayals and recriminations in her head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I, meanwhile, was trying to come to grips with a suite sitting empty in Beaver lodge while dozens of families slept in makeshift cots and hammocks just next door.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A functioning shower.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Space to stretch out, to feel comfortable, to feel human.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All of it, denied to homeless refugees (what else were we?) to make us work harder.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was monstrous.</p> <p class="p2">I set aside a clean tub and picked up the next one.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I'm starting to look forward to our little gathering, Maggie.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Thank you for suggesting it."</p> <p class="p2">I never told Maggie anything more about my interaction with Cole, about how I got him to talk.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I didn't tell her about Aubrey, either, but there was little secret to keep, there, outside of whatever was in those vials.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But I'd flirted with Cole and he'd responded.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Somehow that felt more significant than running drugs for a sweetie I'd slept with months ago.</p> <p class="p2">Did I hold my tongue about Cole because I feared that Maggie would want me to exploit that link with the Director of the refuge?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Did I stay quiet about Aubrey because I knew Maggie would have nothing but disdain for an affair with a sweetie?</p> <p class="p2">Or did I just want to keep those interactions to myself, a secret only for me to know–for me to mull over in my bunk at night?</p> <p class="p2">Sometimes I wondered if I kept delivering Aubrey's envelopes just for her perfume.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each time she gave me a handoff I would smell her for the rest of the day, as if I could turn around and she'd be there behind me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When she stepped close, the heady mix of that fragrance, her body heat, her breath, even the barest hint of her sweat in the summer heat… it overwhelmed me.</p> <p class="p2">I told myself that I trusted her, in my more sober moments, that I knew she was a woman of principles and if she said it needed to be done, it did.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But what did I know of her, really?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Two nights of drinking wine on the Lodge balcony, chatting and flirting: that was all I had to go on, and in that moment most of my attention had been focused on oh-god-is-this-really-happening, not some inventory of her moral character.</p> <p class="p2">But I did know Cole.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Compared to my one weekend with Aubrey, I'd spent dozens working alongside Cole.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An intense man, and a driven one–so driven, in fact, that he'd disregard the little problems until they turned into big problems.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Reckless.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Your typical man-with-a-vision who'll stop at nothing to see it come true.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And this was the man whose eager smile and responsive chatter I was keeping to myself?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Why?</p> <p class="p2">In all the time I'd known him, over the course of years, he'd never made a move, never expressed romantic interest in me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Had things changed, cooped up in the refuge for who knows how long, putting him on the prowl for companionship?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or had I, perhaps, imagined it all?</p> <p class="p2">I was not young.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Two grown boys in my wake, too.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These were not the kind of things that men looked for, in my experience.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If Jameson could marry the three prettiest girls in his Lodge, no doubt Cole could, too.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For all I knew, Cole kept a rotation of sweet young things from Golden Eagle cycling through his bedroom.</p> <p class="p2">Maybe I hadn't said anything about Cole because Maggie might laugh at the very idea I'd turned his head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And that laugh would shatter all of it, like a house of mirrors collapsing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If Cole couldn't possibly want me, neither could Aubrey. The only person who could want me was Arthur, and that for nostalgia more than anything else.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>More accurately, the sense that he'd had something taken away unjustly and he'd like it back, if only to prove that he'd never really lost it, never fumbled it, never screwed up.</p> <p class="p2">Every once in a while, though, I'd catch Arthur looking me up, not possessively but with a familiar hunger in his eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It wasn't all nostalgia and wounded pride with him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And if Arthur wanted me like that, perhaps it was not impossible that Cole and Aubrey might, too.</p> <p class="p2">Which was the core of it, I realized: I kept these interactions to myself just to preserve the possibility of romance, that I might be wanted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Day to day, I was a dusty, dirty, achey, stinky mess, accounted as nothing more than a strong back and a pair of willing hands.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Barely human.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But if someone might think of me as something more… even the hope of it made me feel alive.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Made me forget the grime and the stench.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Kept me sane.</p> <p class="p2">Even if it was the resident despot.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or some sort of drug-running rogue medic.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For the sake of retaining my sanity and humanity, I'd take what I could get.</p> <p class="p2">—</p> <p class="p2">"Hey, we remember you!" cried one of two young women who dropped their trays onto the table and sat down opposite me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For a moment, I struggled to place them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One plump, blonde, and cheery; the other lanky, brunette, and also cheery.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Neither could be more than twenty-five; I felt like I was back in the first few weeks of fall semester, trying to remember the names of new students.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"From church a few weeks ago, right?"</p> <p class="p2">"Oh, right, of course," I responded with a nod.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They were the two girls from Gray Wolf Lodge who'd sat near me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"How goes your hunt for some nice young men?"</p> <p class="p2">They tittered at that, but the giggles died off quickly.</p> <p class="p2">"Not so well," I observed.</p> <p class="p2">"We are not the only applicants for the positions," the darker-haired one noted sourly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"And we're not sure the others are playing fair."<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She looked sidelong at her friend, who shared an aggrieved sigh with her.</p> <p class="p2">"There are rumors," the other one explained, "that the Mountain Lion boys have a… secret hideaway somewhere in the refuge, where they…"<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She waved a dispirited hand.</p> <p class="p2">"Apparently it's pretty seedy," her friend put in.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"But it has a tatty old mattress, so it gets the job done."</p> <p class="p2">I wrinkled my nose in sympathy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I'm sorry to hear that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remind me your names?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I'm Susan."</p> <p class="p2">Rachel was the curvy blonde; Rebecca the brunette.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Thanks for letting us sit with you, by the way. We don't know a lot of people in third mess."</p> <p class="p2">Making conversation, I asked why we had the pleasure of their company.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Oh, we were playing waitress for the Wolfpack while they had their–what was it–strategic planning meeting," Rachel said, and then giggled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Not that I think that will happen again."</p> <p class="p2">Her friend shared her amusement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Did you see Tzavaras's face?" she laughed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"She was so pissed."</p> <p class="p2">My ears had immediately perked at 'strategic planning,' so I prompted the conversation along, hoping to steer it back towards what they might have overheard.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Do they usually have… waitresses for their meetings?"</p> <p class="p2">Rachel shook her head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"No, it was some lieutenant's bright idea.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He got his hands on some hooch, and wanted… well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I got the feeling he was hoping we'd wear less as we poured drinks."</p> <p class="p2">Rebecca snorted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Yeah.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Because when I was packing to hike through the mountains to a secret summer camp to wait out the apocalypse, I made sure to grab my bikini."</p> <p class="p2">"Well I did," Rachel said with a smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"But mostly because my one-piece was dirty and I thought, you know, maybe swimming?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Before we found out what it was really like."</p> <p class="p2">I chuckled along with them, then applied a little pressure towards juicier details.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"You said Tzavaras was angry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Did she just not want you two overhearing their bickering about poolie management?"<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I hoped, though, that there had been more sensitive information bandied about.</p> <p class="p2">"Oh, no, that's not what pissed her off," Rebecca laughed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"She was upset that one of her guys wanted us to be eye candy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Chewed him out for it but good, too."</p> <p class="p2">My eyebrows lifted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Is she… normally so… concerned?"</p> <p class="p2">Rachel looked uncertain but Rebecca nodded eagerly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Tzavaras has got our back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I mean, I just assume it's from being a lady in the military for so long, but she takes no shit on the misogyny front."<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then she covered her lips with the tips of her fingers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Oh, excuse my language."</p> <p class="p2">Rachel winked conspiratorially across the table.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"We may have… tested the quality of the hooch we were serving."</p> <p class="p2">I laughed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Any good?"</p> <p class="p2">"Oh, it was awful," Rebecca giggled.</p> <p class="p2">Rachel looked dubiously at her friend.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"And stronger than it looked."</p> <p class="p2">"Tzavaras okay with drunk soldiers at her strategy meeting?" I prompted with a smirk which I hope invited gossip.</p> <p class="p2">Rebecca snorted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I think that's the only reason she let us stay," she tittered.</p> <p class="p2">"I'm sure they were only talking about who digs what hole, anyway," I said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I wasn't sure if I was more amused or frustrated at how diffident the two tipsy ladies were proving to be.</p> <p class="p2">"No, they were all looking over maps and talking about–what was it–assault vectors.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Seizing targets."</p> <p class="p2">"Force multipliers," the other put in. "Site B."</p> <p class="p2">A scowl knit itself across my brow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Maps of the refuge?" I asked, trying to tamp down my instant suspicion, or at least make it less visible.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Was Tzavaras planning some sort of coup?</p> <p class="p2">"No, road maps, city maps," Rebecca shook her head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Not here.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Other places."</p> <p class="p2">I frowned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Were they… hypothetical war games and the like?"</p> <p class="p2">Suddenly grave, Rachel shook her head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"No, they were very serious about how much risk they were willing to take for each target."</p> <p class="p2">"So they're planning raids,” I concluded soberly.</p> <p class="p2">For a brief moment, Rachel met my eye and I could feel the full, terrible weight of the revelation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Wolfpack weren't happy guarding the henhouse.</p> <p class="p2">Rebecca, missing the gravity between the two of us, shrugged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"When all you've got is a hammer, right?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And Tzavaras is in command of a whole bag of hammers."<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A beat later, she realized what she'd said and dissolved into giggles.</p> <p class="p2">"If they piss someone off and lead them back here–" I said to Rachel fearfully.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She only shrugged helplessly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As if we didn't have enough to worry about inside the refuge, now I could contemplate the spectre of raids against a poorly-selected target, more capable or more vindictive than they appeared, escalating to some sort of petty war.</p> <p class="p2">Not to mention the sickening prospect that all our work would be supporting a band of plundering bandits.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A voice in the back of my head sourly noted that we'd jokingly called the refuge proto-feudal, and now we'd achieved full bloom.</p> <p class="p2">The two women had gleaned no further details, so we moved on to other, less distressing topics.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Almost out of habit, I fell into the ebb and flow of a relational meeting, interviewing the both of them.</p> <p class="p2">Despite appearances, Rachel and Rebecca were not old friends who had come to the refuge together.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rachel was 19, fresh from taking a year off to backpack around Europe–a trip funded by her stock broker parents.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She had planned to attend her mother's alma mater in the fall, but wasn't very enthusiastic about the prospect.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Those plans had obviously been cancelled in the panicked flight to Tall Pines.</p> <p class="p2">Rebecca, by contrast, was a university sophomore studying anthropology and dance ("because why have one useless major when you can have two?").<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her boyfriend had insisted on bringing her to the refuge when his parents decided it was time for the family to bug out of civilization.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They did not have a spare subscription for her; it was a terrible gamble that could have left her abandoned outside the gate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But the boyfriend hadn’t made it–gunned down before they ever reached the mountain–and so Rebecca took his berth.</p> <p class="p2">The two met in the Gray Wolf labor pool and latched on to each other immediately.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was easy to see why: Rachel looked up to Rebecca's relative maturity while Rebecca relied on her friend's familiarity with the refuge and the refugee elites who populated it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(Even tipsy, Rebecca had carefully deflected any questions about her family's wealth growing up.)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They served as each other's bulwark against the refuge's sometimes incomprehensible yet ever-present dangers.</p> <p class="p2">I heard myself say, "Hey, after lunch on Sunday, there's a bunch of us meeting up here in the Mess.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Just to… chat, hang out, maybe vent our gripes to sympathetic ears.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you wanted to join us?"<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Why was I inviting them to the networking event?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Had I got caught up in the rhythm of the relational meeting and invited them by reflex?</p> <p class="p2">They hardly struck me as the type to take action, but rather the type to roll over and vainly try to follow whatever rules were inflicted on them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Perhaps they'd cry to each other in a weak, private moment about how it was all so hard.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But stepping up to change the rules themselves must have seemed as alien to them as bucking down to honest labor would seem to Bukhari.</p> <p class="p2">Perhaps it was their youthful vitality (how much did I miss having students to inspire me!).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Did I unconsciously detect some hidden reservoir of determination beneath Rebecca's obfuscated past?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or most likely, I told myself, it was that strength they clearly gave each other, the strength to persevere against an incoherent but plainly hostile world.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That was something that our fledgling network could use.</p> <p class="p2">Both of the lit up like lightbulbs at the invitation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I'll bring my guitar!" Rachel promised, and before I could ask how she had come to possess one, they rose to leave.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"It was really nice catching up with you!" they smiled, and then disappeared into the press of poolies filing out the doors.</p> <p class="p2">What had happened?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It felt like my head was spinning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I chuckled at myself and downed the rest of the water in my mug.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Young people.</p> <div class="wi_authornotes"> <div> <div class="p-avatar-wrap"><a class="avatar has-link" href="https://scribblehub.com/profile/149271/miriamrobern/"><img id="acc_ava_change profile" alt="" src="https://cdn.scribblehub.com/avatar/s/37/ava_149271_1743989956.jpg"></a></div> <p><span class="an_username"><a href="https://scribblehub.com/profile/149271/miriamrobern/">miriamrobern</a></span></div> <div style="clear: both;"></div> <div class="wi_authornotes_body"> <h2><b>Thanks for Reading!</b><b></b></h2> <p class="p3">If you’d like to see more like this, please consider subscribing to my patreon at http://patreon.com/miriamrobern</p> <ul class="ul1"> <li class="li4">I post all chapters a month early for subscribers, so you can read ahead.</li> <li class="li4">I also post epub and pdf versions of the book for everybody.</li> </ul> <p class="p3">Thanks for your support, whether it’s becoming a subscriber or posting comments online.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s people like you who let people like me make stuff like this!</p> </div></div></p> </div>

                <div class="chp_raw" id="chp_raw"><p class="p4">“Samantha!” Finley called out, ducking between foreign students as they flooded out of the classroom en masse.</p> <p class="p4">Sammy had retained hardly anything from the hour-long class, distracted by the presence of the genderqueer at the front.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Finley hadn’t made it any easier, trying to catch his eye and offering little smiles as if nobody else would notice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And now they were following him across campus, and their legs were a lot longer than his.</p> <p class="p4">With a sigh, he turned to face them.</p> <p class="p4">“Hey,” they panted, smiling, as they jogged up to him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Their eyes dipped down and back up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You look fantastic.”</p> <p class="p4">Sammy rolled his eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He knew how he looked: like a fake.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although he did have to admit he looked like a competent fake, so there was that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Uh, thanks?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You look nice, too.”</p> <p class="p4">Finley looked downright respectable, which was a weird look on them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Tailored dress pants, a matching blazer over a creamy silk blouse, and fucking loafers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A pair of beaded necklaces dangled over their partially exposed chest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sammy forced himself to make eye contact.</p> <p class="p4">They grimaced down at their clothes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Thanks, I… actually struggled with this outfit a lot more than I felt was necessary.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s my first TA gig, so I wanted to look… reputable and approachable and still queer and—” But then they shook their head and shoulders like a dog shedding water.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“All of that is besides the point.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I wanted to apologize.”</p> <p class="p4">Sammy scowled softly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He almost wished Finley wouldn’t apologize, wouldn’t ever say anything about the last night of Preview Days.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This promised to be awkward; Sammy had probably done something wrong, Finley would call him out for it, and he’d feel like a stupid child.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“What for?” he asked with trepidation.</p> <p class="p4">“For how I acted at the CQA mixer,” they said, face crumpling a bit.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I was just… I was really happy to see you and got… overly excited about it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Which isn’t an excuse.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I trampled all over your bodily autonomy and didn’t check your boundaries and was just… an ass.”</p> <p class="p4">Sammy found himself shaking his head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You weren’t—” he started, then trailed off.</p> <p class="p4">Finley gave him a look.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I know what ‘Jessica called, she needs our help’ means, Samantha.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And I am… fucking mortified I made you feel like you needed a rescue.”</p> <p class="p4">“I didn’t—” he started, and then stopped himself from denying that he had in fact felt like he’d needed a rescue because he’d asked for it, hadn’t he?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It was just… it was a lot.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And I didn’t know any other way out.”</p> <p class="p4">Finley folded their hands over their valise, a gesture plainly chosen to keep their hands from reaching out to him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Yeah, and I should have given you ways out.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And I’m sorry I didn’t.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And I promise I’ll do better in the future.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not just with you, but with everybody. Which isn’t to assume you even want to talk to me again.”</p> <p class="p4">“Well, you are my TA,” Sammy pointed out with a slight smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“We’ll be seeing each other three times a week all summer.”</p> <p class="p4">But their face crumpled again at the reminder.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Is that a problem?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I should probably tell the prof…”</p> <p class="p4">“It’s fine, it’s fine,” Sammy assured them in a rush, reaching out a little.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He snatched his hand back when he realized what he was doing, folding it up against his belly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And I like… talking with you, and I do want to talk to you again.”</p> <p class="p4">“Yeah?” they asked with a shy little smile.</p> <p class="p4">That smile was so delicate and tentative that Sammy suddenly wanted to leap forward and kiss all their nerves away.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He blinked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Calm the fuck down, brain.</p> <p class="p4">“Can I take you to dinner sometime as an apology?” Finley was asking.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m sure you’re not sick of the dining commons yet, but… trust me, you’ll get there, and a little variety goes a long way.”</p> <p class="p4">“I’d like that,” Sammy answered, and sublimated his impulse to lean forward into a much safer friendly smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“The next two months I’m going all-in on my classes for the program, but… I think I’m going to need some downtime, too.”</p> <p class="p4">“Excellent.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ll—” Finley started, and then fumbled into their pocket.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Can I get your number so we can text details?”</p> <p class="p4">They handed over their phone; Sammy punched in his number and handed it back.</p> <p class="p4">“Wait, hold on,” said Finley, brandishing their phone at him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Can I take a picture to add to your contact?”</p> <p class="p4">“…sure?” he answered, and pasted on his taking-a-photo smile.</p> <p class="p4">“Hrm,” Finley muttered from behind the phone.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Hey do me a favour, just… don’t smile?”</p> <p class="p4">What was wrong with his smile, thought Sammy, and relaxed his features.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He took a deep breath and tried not to make any face or look at anything in particular.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He figured he must look like he was spacing out.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Why would Finley want a picture of that?</p> <p class="p4">“Hey Samantha?” Finley said, face still hidden.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When Sammy raised his eyebrows to show he was paying attention, the genderqueer simply said, “You’re beautiful.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A moment later the phone’s camera shutter clicked.</p> <p class="p4">“What the—” Sammy started to say.</p> <p class="p4">“It’s this cool trick, you get great pictures the moment after you give a girl a compliment.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Finley turned their phone around.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“There, you see?”</p> <p class="p4">There he was on the screen: a backdrop of green leaves and red brick behind him, white cardigan over his shoulders and deep crimson cami stretched across his fake cleavage.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But on his face was this surprised little smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The smile had just sparked into his eyes as the pic had been taken, and his raised eyebrows looked like they were floating on top of the undisguised joy that lit up his face.</p> <p class="p4">He looked… well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He looked super cute.</p> <p class="p4">“Kind of an underhanded trick,” he muttered, tamping down another smile, along with the impulse to ask Finley to send him the picture.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Warn a girl next time, would you?”</p> <p class="p4">“Can’t give you warning, then it doesn’t work,” they answered with a little self-satisfied smirk.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They tapped at their phone to save all the details.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“But I’ll let you go.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And text you later, yeah?”</p> <p class="p4">“Go?” Sammy echoed vaguely.</p> <p class="p4">“To your next class?”</p> <p class="p4">“Fuck!” he shouted, and started running.</p> <p class="p4">The program had six courses—Biology, Composition, History, Literature, Math, and Physics, helpfully abbreviated as BIO50, COMP50, HIS50, LIT50, MA50, PH50.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The six classes would theoretically prepare the Marginalized Scholars for the six sections of the final exam.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sammy had stared at the course list, trying to figure out which one he should be most intimidated by, but could never quite decide.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They were all terrifying.</p> <p class="p4">He dashed into the lecture hall for HIS50 with only a few minutes to spare and found the entire front row already filled by his rival overacheivers.</p> <p class="p4">“Welcome to class, Samantha,” called a familiar voice from up under the screen in front.</p> <p class="p4">Sammy turned and was surprised to find Uncle Gideon, in slacks and sweater vest, looking very collegial.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The boy in the skirt swallowed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Uh, hi.”</p> <p class="p4">Gideon grinned as he stepped nearer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Sorry I didn’t say anything about teaching this course.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I meant to, when we visited you in your dorm room, but then you guys had to skip out to deal with your wardrobe emergency.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His eyes flicked over Sammy’s outfit.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I see the emergency has been resolved, though.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You look very put together.”</p> <p class="p4">Sammy still didn’t know how to respond to compliments—aside from getting his picture taken, apparently—so he just smiled in response, cheeks hot.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What the—was he actually blushing?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He cleared his throat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Uh.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sorry for being late.”</p> <p class="p4">“You’re not late,” his uncle assured him, but he did shoo him towards the seats.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And you’re in college now,” he added with a grin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Nobody’s going to call home and tell your parents you were tardy.”</p> <p class="p4">As Sammy sat, Gideon clapped his hands together.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Okay everybody, welcome to the History Crash Course!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The architects of this program want this class to cram your heads full of all the names and dates that they think is most important for a good, compliant, All-American student ready to bend over backwards and participate in the project of Empire, but unfortunately they hired me to teach it.”</p> <p class="p4">Scattered chuckles trickled through the room, but most of the students seemed uncertain and a little bit scared at Gideon’s opening salvo.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sammy counted himself among them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was here to prepare for the final exam; he needed all those names and dates.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And he was more than happy to participate in the project of Empire, whatever that was, if it meant he got to attend Columbia.</p> <p class="p4">“My name is Gideon Masters-Roth, and it is my goal in this class to teach you to think historically,” the rebel professor went on, tapping his temple with two fingers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I promise you’ll get to cramming all those names and dates in July when I skip out of here for a couple weeks.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He gestured to a young woman seated at a table to the side of the lecture hall.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Speaking of which, this is Andi Górska, my longsuffering TA, who’ll be taking over for those two weeks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Be nice to her, she is not paid enough to do this job.”</p> <p class="p4">She gave the class a diffident wave.</p> <p class="p4">Gideon directed the whole class to clump up in little groups of four to six so they could introduce each other and where they were from.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sammy shortly found himself in a little circle of five.</p> <p class="p4">“And so the first one is all, hi my name is Leon and I’m from Ukraine,” Sammy told his laptop screen.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And then the next one gives their name and explains that they’re from Gaza.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And then the next one, she’s also from Ukraine, and says that her first choice school doesn’t exist anymore because it got bombed, and the other one from Ukraine and the guy from Gaza, they both nod and say ‘yeah me too.’<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And then the last girl, she’s from Nicaragua and her family got run out of the country because her parents were journalists and pissed off the drug cartels, and her dad’s still fucking missing.”</p> <p class="p4">“Jeeesus,” Rowan breathed, saucer-eyed, from the screen.</p> <p class="p4">“That’s a lot,” Zoey agreed from the other panel of the vidchat.</p> <p class="p4">“Yeah, and then they all turn to me,” Sammy continued on, “all expectant-like, and what the fuck am I supposed to say?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hey, my name is Sammy and I’m a kid from Jersey?”</p> <p class="p4">“What did you say?”</p> <p class="p4">He shrug-flopped.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Hey, my name is Sammy and I’m a kid from Jersey.”</p> <p class="p4">“And their response?” Zoey wanted to know.</p> <p class="p4">He deflated slightly where he sat on his dorm room bed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“They wanted me to tell them where I shopped for clothes.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Their reception of his personal background had seemed so petty Sammy hadn’t known how to respond—especially since he’d forgotten the names and locations of all the places to which Rowan had dragged him.</p> <p class="p4">“Well yeah, you looked like that?” his cousin asked, eyebrow arched.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You didn’t come home and change clothes?”</p> <p class="p4">He looked down—cleavage yawned open under his gaze; at some point he’d get used to that, right?—and then back up at the screen.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I mean.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yeah?”</p> <p class="p4">“It’s a nice ‘fit,” Rowan told him with a shrug.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“So if by their standards you’re a local, and a well-dressed one at that, asking for shopping tips is understandable.”</p> <p class="p4">“Yeah but—” he sighed, struggling to articulate his discomfort.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“They’re all fleeing persecution and fucking warzones, and all I bring to the table is where to get a cute skirt?”</p> <p class="p4">“Well they’re probably tired of being refugees all the time,” Zoey pointed out, “and hope that maybe you can help them feel a little normal for a change.”</p> <p class="p4">He slumped against the wall and exhaled. “Makes sense, I guess.”</p> <p class="p4">“Or they’re hitting on you,” Rowan put in with a smirk.</p> <p class="p4">“Nobody is hitting on me,” Sammy insisted, even though he was pretty sure two guys in Pre-Calc and a girl in the Lit class had been feeling him out.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They’d asked him “get to know you” questions with an almost disquieting intensity.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was here to study; he didn’t want distractions.</p> <p class="p4">As if on cue, his phone buzzed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He scooped it up to read a short text message from Finley asking if he liked seafood.</p> <p class="p4">“Oooooh, who’s got you smiling like that?” teased Rowan.</p> <p class="p4">“Wait, what happened?” asked Zoey, coming back into view from off-camera. “I missed it!”</p> <p class="p4">“Nothing—”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He tried to say, wiping his face clear, but he could feel his cheeks burning.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He had absolutely been smiling at his phone like a goober.</p> <p class="p4">“Somebody texted Sammy and her face lit up like a Christmas tree,” his treacherous cousin giggled.</p> <p class="p4">“It’s not that, it’s just Finley,” he told them with a roll of his eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“They’re the TA for Bio.”</p> <p class="p4">“And they were texting you the syllabus?” Rowan asked, skeptical eyebrow raised.</p> <p class="p4">“No, they’re just…” Sammy started, and then realized if he didn’t volunteer the whole story now, Rowan would pry it out of him, anyway.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“They came up to me after class to say sorry for moving too fast at that CQA event and then they asked me to dinner.”</p> <p class="p4">“So as part of Finn’s apology for moving too fast, they asked you on a date?” his cousin attempted to summarize, now lifting both eyebrows.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And you said yes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Damn, they’ve got game!”</p> <p class="p4">“It’s not a date,” he insisted. “It’s an apology.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They’re taking me to dinner as an apology.”</p> <p class="p4">Both Rowan and Zoey just stared at him blankly, waiting.</p> <p class="p4">He blinked first.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Fuck, is it a date?”</p> <p class="p4">“Well, that would make something else make sense,” Zoey said, and explained: “Earlier today Finn did kind of ask me if they could ethically date somebody in a class they were the TA for.”</p> <p class="p4">“I mean, it is kind of sketchy,” Rowan conceded.</p> <p class="p4">“Right, but in this case, the final class grade, the part that they might have undue influence over, doesn’t matter,” she pointed out.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s just the exam score at the end that matters, and that’s impartial.”</p> <p class="p4">“So what did you tell them?” Sammy wanted to know.</p> <p class="p4">Zoey shrugged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I think they’re in the clear.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ethically speaking.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So they can date… somebody in the class they TA for.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Which may or may not be you.”</p> <p class="p4">“But it probably is,” said Rowan pragmatically.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And you said yes?”</p> <p class="p4">“Yes,” Sammy groaned, pressing himself against the cool brick wall.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It counteracted the full-body flush he had going on.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I said yes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But I didn’t think it was a date!”</p> <p class="p4">“What else did they say?” Zoey asked, probing for clarification.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“They were sorry, they asked you out, what else?”</p> <p class="p4">Rowan cut through all the extraneous details that Sammy was considering mentioning as a smoke screen: “Did they compliment you?”</p> <p class="p4">“Um,” he mumbled, wondering if he could hedge.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I mean, sort of?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When we started talking, they… said I looked fantastic.”</p> <p class="p4">“Well, you do,” Zoey noted dispassionately.</p> <p class="p4">“And?” his cousin demanded, eyeing him critically through the laptop.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I can tell you’re holding out on us.”</p> <p class="p4">Casting his eyes to his popcorn ceiling, Sammy sighed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And they called me beautiful.”</p> <p class="p4">“Awww!”</p> <p class="p4">“No, it wasn’t like that, it was a… a trick to get a good photo for…” Too late, he realized exactly where he was blundering.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“…for my number in their phone.”</p> <p class="p4">“Samantha,” Zoey said flatly, and waited until he was paying attention before continuing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Find out if it’s a date… before the date happens.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Don’t put it off, okay?”</p> <p class="p4">“What, like over text?” he sputtered.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Or in class on Wednesday?”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Both of those options sounded like trainwrecks.</p> <p class="p4">“Better than over dinner,” Rowan pointed out reasonably.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Get on the same page before the date starts or else one of you is guaranteed to be disappointed.”</p> <p class="p4">On Tuesdays and Thursdays he only had two classes, but they were both two hours long: Composition in the morning and Physics in the afternoon.</p> <p class="p4">“This is not a class about writing,” the Comp professor had declared.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“This is a class about editing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We will be writing a 500-word essay every week.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You will bring your first drafts in on Tuesday.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You will exchange them with other students for editing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We will discuss in class.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then you’ll take it home and bring a revised draft on Thursday.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each Thursday we’ll have a handful of you read your essay aloud.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She nodded as if this was at all reasonable.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“At the end of this eight-week course, you’ll have written 4,000 near-perfect words.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m letting you off light! By the time you get to the final exam, tossing off a solid 500 words will be child’s play.”</p> <p class="p4">Physics, by contrast, was taught by a scattered, spare little man who didn’t look much older than his students.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He explained that they had an absurd amount of material to cover, especially since this “Physics” class was also supposed to cover basic chemistry, and then he immediately launched into a lecture on the four fundamental forces of nature.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Oh,” he added at the end as they were picking up their textbooks, binders, and bags, “we’ll have a quick quiz at the end of class Thursday—or maybe the start of class on Tuesday—going over what we’ve covered that week.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or the week prior.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You understand what I mean.”</p> <p class="p4">Sammy never quite got around to texting Finley about their maybe-date before it was time to show up to Biology on Wednesday morning, but the genderqueer just smiled at him across the room, and only the once.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No further contact was made, and Sammy dashed out of the classroom before any could be made.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He had three more classes that day and didn’t need any more distractions.</p> <p class="p4">“Our key task,” intoned the literature professor Dr Ngawa, “as readers and as human beings, is that of interpretation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The interpretation not just of texts and of speech acts, but also of our phenomenological world.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ngawa liked to pace as he lectured, roving up and down the steps of the room’s sparsely-occupied stadium seating.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“That is to say: we are surrounded by signs and symbols, and we are thrust, every day, into interpretting what it all means.”</p> <p class="p4">“Don’t have to tell me twice,” Sammy muttered under his breath, to the amusement of the dark-eyed girl sitting on his right.</p> <p class="p4">“Grab a piece of paper,” directed the professor, “and write down a short description—just a sentence—of an encounter that you had with an ambigious sign.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some situation where you could not tell what was meant.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You could not interpret.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Speech act or text or situation,” he elaborated while waving both hands around his head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Just.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Jot it down.”</p> <p class="p4">Sammy opened his notebook to a blank page and tried to think of a time when he didn’t understand what was happening.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It seemed like a regular occurence for him, but nothing specific came to mind.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Nothing besides the obvious and immediate situation he was mired in, of course, and as time stretched on and everyone else started putting down their pens, he frantically scribbled out: <i>Can’t tell if I was asked out on a date.</i><i></i></p> <p class="p4">“Miss Masters,” came Ngawa’s baritone, sounding off right behind Sammy’s seat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The professor had crept up while he’d dithered over what to write.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“What have you written?”</p> <p class="p4">Sammy felt all the blood drain out of his face.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Oh, I thought—” he stammered.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I mean, I thought this was just for… I didn’t think we were sharing it.”</p> <p class="p4">Ngawa gave him a significant look, and then broadcast that look across the whole room.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Ah.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So your interpretation of the instructions you were given included some biases and assumptions of your own.”</p> <p class="p4">Trying to laugh it off, Sammy nodded and prayed that that would appease the professor’s inquiry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But Ngawa only watched him, eyebrows raised expectantly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sammy opened his mouth, closed it, and finally just gave up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I wrote down that I can’t tell if I got asked out on a date.”</p> <p class="p4">A ripple of good-natured laughter pattered through the lecture hall, and Sammy took a little comfort from the response.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A high school classroom would have immediately overflowed with braying mockery.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This was different, like everybody sympathized.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He felt the corners of his lips lifting slightly.</p> <p class="p4">“A common lament,” the professor intoned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“A nice boy asked you out, but you’re not sure if he <i>asked you out</i> asked you out.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even the language we use to describe—”</p> <p class="p4">“Oh, uh,” Sammy half-objected impulsively, and Ngawa paused to lift his expectant eyebrows again.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sammy explained: “Finley’s not a boy.”</p> <p class="p4">“Oh ho!” the professor chortled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And here’s where <i>my</i> biases and assumptions get in the way of my interpretation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My apologies to Miss Finley, she of the ambiguous scheduling practices.”</p> <p class="p4">This time Sammy didn’t make a sound of correction, letting Ngawa move on to pry into some other student’s private life.</p> <p class="p4"><span class="s1">Is Friday night okay for dinner?</span> Finley texted as class was breaking up, which only served to make Sammy apprehensive.</p> <p class="p4">Friday night was a date night, right?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A casual dinner on a random Tuesday, that wasn’t likely to be a date.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dinner on Friday night, though?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That was definitely date territory.</p> <p class="p4">Sammy took a long, shaky breath.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Interpreting ambiguous speech acts, indeed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Finley was almost certainly asking him out on a date.</p> <p class="p6">I’m just thinking about how you said you wanted to go all-in on your classes,<span class="s2"> said the next text.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></span>Friday night seems like the least impact on your studies?</p> <p class="p4">Well fuck, now he didn’t know what to think.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sammy groaned audibly and shoved his phone into his backpack.</p> <p class="p4">“That your maybe-date?” asked the dark-eyed girl with a twinkle in her eye.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Finley?”</p> <p class="p4">Sammy heaved a sigh.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Yeah.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Apparently we’re going out on Friday.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So I have two days to figure out if we’re actually going out or if we’re just… going out.”</p> <p class="p4">The girl closed her notebook.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’d love to hear how it turns out for you,” she giggled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“If it turns out to not be a date, there are always other options.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She raked her eyes up and down his body, smirked, and stalked out of the classroom.</p> <p class="p4">Sammy watched her go, bewilderment giving way to curiousity.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He pulled his phone back out, reversed the camera, and took as full-body a selfie as he could.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He sent the result to Rowan.</p> <p class="p4"><span class="s1">Hot,</span> she responded immediately.</p> <p class="p4">Sammy rolled his eyes and then examined the photo he’d just sent her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The wispy blouse that he’d thought kind of conservative this morning had apparently started showing off an eyeful of cleavage while he wasn’t looking.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And the capris that had seemed like simple pants were hugging his hips and thighs and—he took a quick side-angle selfie to verify—yeah, they were doing something almost indecent to his ass.</p> <p class="p4">How on earth did he have this much ass?</p> <p class="p6"><span class="s2">He texted his cousin: </span>why are all of the clothes we got me either tight or revealing or otherwise slutty in some secret surprise way?</p> <p class="p6">Why would you want clothes that aren’t?<span class="s2"> came the reply.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></span>The point of clothes is to look hot.</p> <p class="p4">Sammy didn’t even know how to respond, and he had Pre-Calc in fifteen minutes.</p> <p class="p2">The next morning he went through his new wardrobe like a tornado, trying to put together an outfit that Rowan would not describe as ‘hot.’<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was difficult.</p> <p class="p2">Which wasn’t exactly true.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He could throw together a bunch of mismatched garments, but then he just looked weird.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Like he couldn’t dress himself or couldn’t see how this top and that skirt didn’t go together, when they really obviously did not.</p> <p class="p2">What he needed was not <i>hot</i> but also not <i>incompetent</i>.</p> <p class="p2">For a half-second he considered his box of hoodies and sweats, but actually shuddered at the thought.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Heavy and scratchy and hot and… frumpy.</p> <p class="p2">When the hell had ‘frumpy’ invaded his vocabulary?</p> <p class="p2">He tried again, without trying so hard as to create a jarring mismatch.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This cami, that skirt that probably wasn’t quite right, and then that weird little jacket-thing from that weird little boutique, where’d it go?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He donned the questionable ensemble, smoothed down his lines, and turned to look in the mirror.</p> <p class="p2">“Oh, huh,” he said aloud, scrutinizing himself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Hold on a minute…”</p> <p class="p2">He doffed the jacket and swapped the cami for a ruffle-fronted blouse, then slipped the jacket back on and turned to look in the mirror.</p> <p class="p2">“Okay,” he told his reflection, “this looks really…” His shoulders slumped.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Hot.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Fuck!”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How easily he lost sight of what he was trying to accomplish and fell back into… whatever took over his brain in the morning and assembled almost-but-not-quite inappropriately hot outfits for class.</p> <p class="p2">He considered changing again, but the outfit really did look good.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And he was going to be late if he dithered any more.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He shrugged at his reflection.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Might as well just wear it for the day.”</p> <p class="p4">By the end of class on Thursday, all six professors had made clear their expectations for how much reading the students would be doing, and most of the initial deadlines were next week.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was… a lot.</p> <p class="p4">Even Math had reading to do, which Sammy felt was vaguely unfair.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Math and reading were opposite poles on the academic globe; you shouldn’t ever have to read in order to math.</p> <p class="p4">But all of this was why Thursday evening found Sammy sitting at a table in the back of the dining commons.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Textbooks were spread out all around him; a tray of dinner sat half-eaten and forgotten at the periphery.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He had so much reading to do.</p> <p class="p4">The good news, though, was that he seemed to be getting his focus back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With four days’ worth of a regular supply of pills in his system, the fog had cleared and he could read, he could discuss, he could think again.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How did other people do college without these pills?</p> <p class="p4">“Did you read all those poems yet?” asked a voice, bringing Sammy out of his reverie.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He looked up to find the dark-eyed girl from Literature class.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“There were so many.”</p> <p class="p4">“I think the idea was that they’re all short?” he hazarded.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Kind of an easy way to get us started.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And then we’re supposed to read a whole novel by Monday, which… I hope it’s not boring.”</p> <p class="p4">“Oh, it’s some white girl who thinks she’s poor because her family only has a maid and a cook taking care of their every need.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So to avoid a life of such unfathomable poverty… she must date.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She threw the back of her hand up against her forehead dramatically and giggled. “Speaking of which, have you figured out your little dating problem?”</p> <p class="p4">Sammy heaved a sigh.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“No.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ve been avoiding it by digging into the reading.”</p> <p class="p4">“Can I ask you a question?” she asked with half a smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When he nodded, she asked, “Are you hoping it’s not a date, or that it is?”</p> <p class="p4">“I mean—” he started, stalled, and then shrugged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I don’t even know.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I definitely don’t need any distractions right now.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This program is my one shot for… everything, and I’m not going to fuck it up.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He paused, considering.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“But at the same time… it’d be nice if it was?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I, uh, I’ve never been asked before.”</p> <p class="p4">The girl blinked, startled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I don’t believe that.”</p> <p class="p4">Sammy shrugged again.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was the simple truth.</p> <p class="p4">“Maybe you’re just really bad at telling when somebody’s into you,” she suggested.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Maybe you’ve been asked out tons and you’ve just never noticed.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She considered him from under one arched eyebrow.</p> <p class="p4">“Yeah, I don’t think so,” Sammy giggled, realized he’d just giggled, and blushed.</p> <p class="p4">He wasn’t oblivious (not when he’d taken his pills), and this girl had already made her interest clear.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He just had trouble wrapping his head around the very concept that somebody was hitting on him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All he had to do was slap on some fake tits and a little makeup and suddenly he was popular?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It seemed ludicrous.</p> <p class="p4">“No, Samantha, you’re… really pretty,” she pressed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She blushed as she said it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“If the girls weren’t asking you out in high school, I guarantee they were pining for you across the room.”</p> <p class="p4">“Yeah, I… didn’t always look like this,” he protested weakly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was something in this girl’s voice that was edging towards the desperate, and suddenly Sammy wanted nothing more than to just turn off whatever was happening.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The only problem was that he had no idea how to do that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He gestured down at himself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“All I wore through high school was hoodies and sweat pants.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The… fashion is all new, and entirely my cousin’s doing.”</p> <p class="p4">“Well tell your cousin thank you for providing the class with eye candy,” she grinned, and leaned her rump up against the table beside him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He realized a beat later that she was ideally positioned to look straight down his shirt.</p> <p class="p4">What was he supposed to do?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Cover himself?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Stand up?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He realized he couldn’t even remember this girl’s name, and asking for it now might seem like he was expressing interest, when all he wanted to do was read.</p> <p class="p4">Sudden inspiration struck, and he went with it before he could examine the impulse.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“No, when I say I didn’t look like this, I mean I didn’t look like a girl.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m transgender.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Maybe that would scare her off.</p> <p class="p4">But she only nodded.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I mean, I didn’t want to assume, but I did kind of figure.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You make a very pretty girl, Samantha.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Good choice on chasing that dream.”</p> <p class="p4">She was, absolutely and unmistakably, looking down his shirt.</p> <p class="p4">“Listen,” he finally grimaced.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’ve… got a lot of reading to do.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He gestured to the array of books spread out before him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I don’t want to be rude.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I just… I can’t fall behind.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ll see you in class tomorrow?”</p> <p class="p4">“Oh shit, sorry, yeah,” the girl stammered, immediately straightening and wiping her palms on her thighs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You even said and I… sorry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yeah, I’ll see you in class.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She backpedaled a few steps, turned to go, and then turned back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I hope your dating situation works out the way you want it to, Samantha.”</p> <p class="p4">He smiled and nodded.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Thanks.”</p> <p class="p4">Sammy turned back to his books, very intentionally not watching her go, except for the little peeks he took as she beelined for the door.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She turned left once outside and walked along a bank of windows, staying within easy view.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>From the few glances he stole, she seemed to be talking to herself, and not kindly.</p> <p class="p4">He groaned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All he wanted was to avoid distractions and absolutely destroy the Marginalized Scholars’ final exam.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’d worried that pretending to be trans, dressing up and doing his makeup every day, remembering his fake name and fake pronouns, would be one of those distractions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’d accepted that as the cost of entry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But never had he even considered that dressing up and doing his makeup would bring him more distractions in the form of… amorous attention.</p> <p class="p4">At the same time, complaining about it seemed spectacularly shitty.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Oh no, people wanted to talk with him, get to know him, even date him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Walking across campus, people smiled at him for no discernible reason.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And just because he couldn’t understand it didn’t mean he didn’t like it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It felt like people wanted him to be there, wanted him to be in their shared space.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Welcoming him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a heady feeling, and if he was honest with himself, he didn’t want it to stop.</p> <p class="p4">He just had to figure out how to get all this reading done, too.</p> <p class="p2">Sammy’s Friday classes ended at 3:30.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Finley would pick him up in his dorm lobby at 6.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By the time he reached his dorm room, Sammy was down to two hours and fifteen minutes to clarify what was happening before it happened.</p> <p class="p2">So he took a shower.</p> <p class="p2">It was almost 4:30 when Sammy returned to his room, steaming and clean and frustrated that the distraction of hot, streaming water had been used up.</p> <p class="p2">He had to get dressed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He hadn’t had time to unpack all the clothes he’d bought with Rowan; the bags were all still piled up in the corner.</p> <p class="p2">He poured it all out onto his bed and started folding.</p> <p class="p2">By the time 5 o’clock rolled around he’d sorted all his new clothes into the appopriate drawers and hangers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then he pulled out the clothes he might wear that night.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He had three options out of what was still clean.</p> <p class="p2">Could he do laundry?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No, he didn’t have enough time for laundry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Finley would be there in less than an hour.</p> <p class="p2">And before Finley got there, Sammy should text them to ask if they were going on a date, or if they were just going out to dinner as friends who were apologizing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For things that happened four months ago.</p> <p class="p2">But he had options for what to wear.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He couldn’t just go as he was right now, which was naked.</p> <p class="p2">Fuck, he had to re-affix his tits.</p> <p class="p2">Now it was 5:35 and his fake boobs wobbled on his chest as he contemplated his three outfits.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One set—a white skirt and an orange frilly blouse—was boring and basic but that might be an advantage.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The next was… well, it was club gear.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Shimmery top and a flippy skirt.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Classy club gear, but it was designed for dancing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Would there be dancing?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At the restaurant?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Was that a thing?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And then the last was a skater dress, vibrant blue with black polka dots, which was very plainly date wear, and he was mildly frustrated that he didn’t have a necklace that went with it.</p> <p class="p2">Finally he realized that he couldn’t decide what to wear if he didn’t know if he was going on a date or not.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He pulled out his phone and stared at it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was 5:45.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Finley was probably already on his way.</p> <p class="p2">With a muttered curse, Sammy typed out a dozen different texts and deleted them, and finally settled for: <span class="s1">Is this a date?</span><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Simple.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Straightforward.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To the point.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was no way Finley could misunderstand or mangle the query.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sammy would get a straight answer.</p> <p class="p2">His phone buzzed, and he looked at the answer: <span class="s1">Do you want this to be a date?</span></p> <p class="p2">Sammy screamed at his phone.</p> <p class="p2">What the fuck kind of answer was that?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Surely when Finn had asked him, they’d either thought they were asking him on a date or they weren’t.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That was something you asked with intention.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You couldn’t do it accidentally, and if you were doing it on purpose, you sure as fuck knew what you were asking.</p> <p class="p2">Sammy was about to shoot back something scathing but his phone displayed three little bouncing dots.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He watched them bounce until they quieted and disappeared.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His breath caught, but then they returned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Bounce bounce bounce, wobble wobble wobble.</p> <p class="p2">He stared, transfixed, until the dots turned into words.</p> <p class="p6">Here’s the thing<span class="s3">, said the text.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></span>At the end of summer term, I’m leaving for med school in California.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So while I am very open to this being a date, I can’t do a relationship that doesn’t have an expiration date.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m also very open to this being a non-date dinner.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I think you’re cool and I’d like to share a meal, date or not.</p> <p class="p2">Sammy read the text through three times, and then it was followed by: <span class="s1">So?</span></p> <p class="p2">He grabbed the skater dress.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Date wear it is.”</p> <div class="wi_authornotes"> <div> <div class="p-avatar-wrap"><a class="avatar has-link"

                <div class="chp_raw" id="chp_raw"><p class="p2">Without fail, when the work detail required digging, our supervising sweeties would appoint a poolie overseer and disappear.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So it was Teddy standing over my boys and I was we dug out the foundation of another cabin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>George had slipped across from where he was supposed to be digging to join our little band, mostly for conversation.</p> <p class="p2">"It was weird," Caden said, using a sturdy branch to knock loose a buried rock.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After at least an hour of cajoling, Jackson, George, and I had got Caden talking about his afternoon with Zoe Cole.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"But also… kinda nice."</p> <p class="p2">"Yeah, but what did she have you do?" Jackson pressed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Did she need somebody to do her laundry or something?"</p> <p class="p2">"No," Caden answered, and fidgetted uncertainly with his tree branch. "It wasn't… work, it was… I mean.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Zoe called it a date."</p> <p class="p2">Both Jackson and George shouted in good-natured surprise and congratulations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I gave my boy an indulgent smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I might not be happy about the turn of events, but they were hardly Caden's fault.</p> <p class="p2">"So what did you do with all that alone time, Caden?" George smirked.</p> <p class="p2">"Oh, no, it was more than just me and her," my son hastened to explain.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I hung out with the whole—"<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Here he stumbled to a stop and looked warily at me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"With everybody in her suite."</p> <p class="p2">"Wait, what was that?" Jackson grinned from his place, hip-deep in a new loop shaft.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His brother feigned ignorance, but Jackson pressed on, undeterred.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"You were about to say one thing and then you wimped out."</p> <p class="p2">"I know what you were going to say," George put in devilishly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"And trust me, your mother's going to hear what they call their suite sooner or later, so she might as well hear it from you."</p> <p class="p2">My youngest son went red to his ears and focused his attention on the ground.</p> <p class="p2">I reached over to squeeze his arm.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Honey, don't worry about it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I'm sure it's just some silly adolescent humor."</p> <p class="p2">But he steeled himself and blurted out, "Zoe calls it her man-harem."</p> <p class="p2">George watched me for a reaction as Jackson actually guffawed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I tried to catch my breath.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When Caden finally looked me in the eye, I stammered, "Is that so?"</p> <p class="p2">He gestured limply.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Well I mean, it's Zoe and CeeCee—she's the daughter of Ms. Clark, the Beaver Host?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They room together, and have since the beginning, I guess.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And so they—" and here he managed a slight smile with a tinge of pride.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"As Zoe says, they collect pretty boys."</p> <p class="p2">I stilled my shovel.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Collect them for what?" I asked warningly.</p> <p class="p2">"Exactly what you think, Susan," George answered airily.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Zoe and CeeCee are quite the junior lotharios."</p> <p class="p2">I skewered Caden with an arch look, and he quickly waved his hands.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Nothing happened.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It wasn't like that at all.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mostly we just played video games."</p> <p class="p2">Jackson's ears perked up at that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"What do they got?"</p> <p class="p2">Caden shrugged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Playstation, XBox, a really old Game Cube.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Bunch of games."</p> <p class="p2">"Okay, so, before I wasn't jealous, little bro, but…" Jackson shouldered his shovel and mimed holding a controller in his hands.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"It's been a while."</p> <p class="p2">"Air conditioning, too," Caden added, to his brother's flabbergasted admiration.</p> <p class="p2">"Sounds nice," I agreed as mildly as I could manage.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"What else did you do?"</p> <p class="p2">"Well first she wanted to take me to lunch—there's a sweeties lunch at the Mess, for everybody who's not out with a work crew," he answered, and glanced over his shoulder.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Teddy was orbiting closer to our corner of the work site, so Caden started worrying his buried stone as he talked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"But before we went there, she let me use their shower."</p> <p class="p2">As Jackson redoubled his protestations of envy, I settled my motherly suspicions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I had not failed to notice that Caden had come back freshly showered, but apparently that had happened at the top of the afternoon, to make him presentable.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not at the end, to clean up after a sweaty assignation.</p> <p class="p2">Caden was describing Sweeties Lunch: "It's all the same food that they bring out to the work crews.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Nothing special.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although I'm pretty sure one of the other tables had some… homemade wine or something."</p> <p class="p2">"It would astound me if there wasn't someone somewhere in the refuge making hooch," George chuckled.</p> <p class="p2">"But it was, um, real quiet," Caden went on.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Like not even half the tables were full, and some of the sweeties were just sitting by themselves reading books, you know?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was real… sedate."</p> <p class="p2">The boy's description paused as he and Jackson traded shovel for tree branch, as Caden's rock was nearly dislodged and his brother had just found one.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Caden shoveled and talked at a steady pace.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"And Zoe and I, we just talked, you know?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For like an hour.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Where we grew up, schools, movies we liked—"</p> <p class="p2">"That sounds really nice," I said, trying desperately to find some benefit of the doubt to apply to the situation.</p> <p class="p2">He bobbed his head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"It was.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And after that, we went back to the suite and met everybody else, and then video games happened, and a movie afterwards.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By then it was time for dinner."</p> <p class="p2">"Which you joined us for," I said with no small surprise.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Why not with them?"</p> <p class="p2">"Well they eat at First Mess," Caden answered with a shrug, "and I wasn’t really hungry yet, and… I dunno.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As nice as it was, it was also weird.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Like I said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Too many eyes on me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Like… going to a new school, I guess?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Where everybody else already has their friends and stuff and they're trying to figure out where you'll fit in."</p> <p class="p2">"That does make sense," I told him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Do you think you'll… see her again?" I asked, trying hard to make the question seem as normal and insignificant as it would have been if we were at home, digging in our own back yard.</p> <p class="p2">He shrugged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I dunno.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I think it's up to her way more than me, you know?"</p> <p class="p2">"Certain," Jackson answered from his hole.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Further conversation quieted as Teddy halted his patrol just a few feet away.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His back was turned to us and the rest of the work site, though, and it was a few moments before the cause appeared.</p> <p class="p2">The priest from Sunday service came huffing up the hill, dressed in jeans and a hunter green jacket.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His dog collar peeked out at the top of his zipper.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Close up, he was younger than I had thought he was: forties instead of fifties.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He had a florid face, made blotchy by the exertion of hiking up the hill, and sweat beaded on his brow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Light touches of not-quite-grey threaded through the dark hair his temples.</p> <p class="p2">Teddy watched his approach with his shoulders set in tention.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What interruption, he must be wondering, was about to befall his work site?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And yet as the priest came to a stop before him, the big man was all solicitousness.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Can I help you, father?"</p> <p class="p2">"Yes, excuse me," the priest began after he had caught his breath.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I need to speak with Susan Soza."</p> <p class="p2">My head snapped up on hearing my name, but one thunderous look from Teddy and I bent back to work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My shoveling might have been a little quieter, though, to eavesdrop.</p> <p class="p2">"We're pretty busy, Father," Teddy told him.</p> <p class="p2">The priest drew in a deep breath.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"It's church business."</p> <p class="p2">The big man was quiet for a moment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"All right.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Susan.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You're needed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Make it quick."</p> <p class="p2">I climbed out of the hole and handed my shovel to Teddy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We were short tools, and I was sure he could find someone to use it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The priest dipped his head to me and gestured away from the work site.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Walk with me?"</p> <p class="p2">The small, tight smile I gave him might have been interpreted as compliance, but all I could think about was how I was once again being pulled away from my family.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I wondered what trouble they had attached to me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Had I left his church service with too much haste?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Had I not sung their terrible, lopsided hymns loud enough?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Whatever it was, it was bound to be immaterial nonsense.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I could be making progress building a place for my family to sleep, but first I'd have to deal with whatever insecurities they'd scapegoated on me.</p> <p class="p2">Once we were out of earshot I glanced back at Teddy, who had dropped down into the ground and put the shovel to use himself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Claim 'church business' and you can steal poolies away from work, huh?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I didn't know you could do that."</p> <p class="p2">"Neither did I," he admitted with a pale smile, although this disappeared quickly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Customs and manners are still plastic here, despite how it may seem at times."</p> <p class="p2">We walked on through the trees, away from the ranks of walipinis.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Still," I persisted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Not a bad gig.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No digging for you, just chatting with whoever you like all day."</p> <p class="p2">His features grew grim.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Not for lack of trying.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I put myself in the work rotation, but Jameson took me back off.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Told me that physical labor undermined my role in the community."</p> <p class="p2">I snorted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Except I'd have a lot more respect for you if you worked alongside us.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I doubt I'm alone in that."</p> <p class="p2">"You're not," he responded easily.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I'd have a lot more respect for me, too."</p> <p class="p2">We reached a promontory that allowed us to look down on the compound and across the valley behind it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ridge upon ridge of evergreen extended to the horizon.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The empty blue sky yawned above it all.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The tableau brought a smile to my lips.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I closed my eyes to listen to the wind comb through the trees.</p> <p class="p2">"I've been led to believe that you've been telling people that you and your family are Unitarian Universalists," he said solemnly.</p> <p class="p2">My stomach dropped out of me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When I looked to him, he had folded his hands before himself and his face was unreadable.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Church business," I observed, and he inclined his head minutely.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Delores."</p> <p class="p2">At this his lips twisted in distaste—not for the woman, but for the position he was in.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Gossip is not going to help anyone right now, Mrs Soza."</p> <p class="p2">"Miss Soza," I corrected without thinking.</p> <p class="p2">"You see?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Gossip told me you were married," the priest sighed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"In any case, who exactly is talking is immaterial."<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He looked about to say something else, and then sealed his lips into a frustrated scowl.</p> <p class="p2">I waited for a long moment, but when no further comment seemed forthcoming, I sighed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Yes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My sons and I attended a UU church."</p> <p class="p2">He nodded slowly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"It pains me to suggest it, Miss Soza," he said, and by the way he dragged each word out of his mouth, it was plain that they came with difficulty.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"But you might want to keep that information to yourself."</p> <p class="p2">I considered the priest, fire rising up into my gut.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Excuse me?"<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I spat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Keep it to myself?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Am I interfering with your Christian paradise, here?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Are you concerned that we'll—how did you put it—defile God's little time capsule?"</p> <p class="p2">The priest put up his hands, expression suddenly panicked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"No, Miss Soza, no.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You misunderstand."<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When I lifted my eyebrows for clarification, he continued.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I'm not asking for me, or even for the church.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My concern is entirely for your own safety."</p> <p class="p2">Suddenly the mountain wind, which had seemed so pleasant a moment ago, cut through me like a knife.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The fire in my gut sputtered against the chill.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"My safety."</p> <p class="p2">The priest nodded gravely.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Right now, Miss Soza, this gossip is contained.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I have… counseled those who spoke with me, and convinced them that it's not worth circulating."</p> <p class="p2">Curiosity got the better of me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"How did you do that?"</p> <p class="p2">He looked up at the sky and heaved a sky.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I may have told them that Unitarian Universalism is just another denomination of Christianity.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Which is, technically speaking, true."</p> <p class="p2">"We're the combination of two heresies that together dismantle most of your orthodox beliefs, but sure, a hundred years ago, we called ourselves Christians," I smirked, but my amusement was short-lived.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"And you did this for our safety?"</p> <p class="p2">The priest turned to look out over the tableau.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Please understand, Miss Soza, under Jameson' dictates, I am the Associate Minister of the church here.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Pastor Walter Park is the Senior Minister, and it's he who controls the message.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I just lead the singing and counsel our more… high church congregants.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am an Episcopal priest, so the traditionalists are more comfortable with me."</p> <p class="p2">I let him ramble until he came to a stop.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"And you think Park's message could be dangerous to us?"</p> <p class="p2">Father Donovan frowned out at the mountains.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"There is little I can say explicitly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But I fear that some congregants may… they may be primed to find a target to assuage their discontent."<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He looked at me with pleading eyes.</p> <p class="p2">I nodded once.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I think I take your message.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You're working for a dangerous ideogogue who's whipping up his followers to tear apart anyone he identifies as an outsider.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Don't feel obliged to nod, Father."</p> <p class="p2">The priest did his best to hide a smirk tugging at the corner of his lips.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Instead, he tipped his head side to side.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Minister Park's theology is a little more… confrontational than mine."</p> <p class="p2">"And apocalyptic?” I suggested.</p> <p class="p2">"Oh that count, I can't really blame him," Donovan sighed, and gestured at our surroundings.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"It does seem to be the end of the world, after all."</p> <p class="p2">"Seems that way," I murmured in agreement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Which makes it a poor time for abandoning our principles.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I don't think I can lie about being UU, father."</p> <p class="p2">He slowly shook his head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I wouldn't ask you to.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Just… advise you not to advertise."</p> <p class="p2">I crossed my arms.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If nothing else, I had to appreciate the priest's motive, and I could sympathize with his difficult position.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Suddenly it occurred to me that he might be putting himself in danger speaking to me like this.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I'll take it under consideration, father.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Discretion is not beyond my abilities."</p> <p class="p2">"I won't ask you to return to Sunday service," he said, turning his steps back towards the work site.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I'm sure that would be a bridge too far."</p> <p class="p2">I shook my head ruefully.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"That service is not for me, which was made abundantly clear the last time I attended."<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I fell into step beside him.</p> <p class="p2">"It's a pity," he sighed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I have a feeling I would like to have you in my congregation."</p> <p class="p2">I gave him a short smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"You seem like my kind of minister, too," I told him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Struggling under stifling constraints and all."<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We shared a companionable chuckle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"If I may ask, though, I wouldn't imagine Episcopalian priests made the kind of salary required for a refuge subscription."</p> <p class="p2">He shook his head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Family money.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Actually a family subscription, too.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My uncle passed and bequeathed it to me, and the automatic payments were already set up, so why change anything?"<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A few steps later, he confessed, "I could have cancelled it, but things were already looking dire."</p> <p class="p2">"I totally understand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Coming here can feel like turning your back on the world.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But let me assure you, Father, the world is beset by problems so large that individuals can do nothing about it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you were out there, you'd just be another hungry mouth."</p> <p class="p2">He grumbled without agreeing or disagreeing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Instead I'm playing second fiddle to a minister whose net worth totalled more than my diocese's budget.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Prosperity gospel my eye," he scoffed, then looked sidelong to me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Ahem.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Pardon me."</p> <p class="p2">"I'll be discreet, Father," I grinned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We walked on, and I realized I had a rare opportunity to gain insight into another lodge.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"What about Jameson?" I asked, with a sly enough smile to signal that I knew I was asking more than a mere poolie ought.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"What's it like working for him?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I got the impression the church services were his idea."</p> <p class="p2">"He plucked Walter and I out of the labor pool and put us in the lodge so that we could perform the services," Donovan said uncomfortably.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I tried to suggest we could share a suite, since they have two bedrooms, but Walter wouldn't hear of it."</p> <p class="p2">"Are you sure it was Jameson who didn't want you working?" I mused.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Maybe Park didn't like the precedent set."</p> <p class="p2">He exhaled through his nose.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"The thought had occured to me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But it could have been Jameson just as easily."</p> <p class="p2">"What's he like?"</p> <p class="p2">Donovan scowled ahead, where the build site was coming into view.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I'll say this much.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His wife didn't make it up the mountain.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Too much exposure, caught something, ate something gone bad, I'm not sure.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She died in quarantine, before I arrived.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A month later, though, he told Walter and I that he was ready to marry again.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And he'd picked out three lucky girls from labor pool to be his new wives.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Because, as he pointed out, Solomon had many wives, so why shouldn't he?"</p> <p class="p2">I stumbled to a stop.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"The three girls he sat with during service?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I thought they were his daughters."</p> <p class="p2">"His daughters refuse to have anything to do with him or his church," the priest shrugged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Can't say I blame them."</p> <p class="p2">"Were the girls… forced?" I asked dreadfully, and put my feet into motion.</p> <p class="p2">"Forced, no; coerced, yes," Donovan sighed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"It was their ticket out of labor pool.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For themselves and their families.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Their parents were put into suites.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although Jameson decided that splitting a suite into two bedrooms was reasonable for his in-laws."</p> <p class="p2">We were within earshot of the build site.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Teddy was already climbing out, my shovel still in his broad hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I stopped a few yards away and extended my hand to the priest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"It was surprisingly nice to speak with you, Father."</p> <p class="p2">He shook my hand with a smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Likewise, Miss Soza.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But now I think you'd best get back to work."</p> <p class="p2">Once the priest was gone, Teddy slapped the shovel into my hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"You've got work to make up, Susan.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Let's not make this incident worth reporting."</p> <p class="p2">—</p> <p class="p2">In her prior life before the refuge, Meliena Jones had been a trophy wife, and proud of it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Born the sixth child to struggling immigrants, Meliena knew the score from an early age: it didn't matter how hard you worked, it didn't matter how smart you were.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you had money, you got more money.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And money bought everything else.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No one worked harder than her father, who never had fewer than two jobs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her mother was brilliant–too brilliant for the corrupt kleptocracy that was her home country, from which she was a political refugee.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She'd been so brilliant–and outspoken–that they would kill her if she returned.</p> <p class="p2">Her parents implored her to apply herself to her studies, to get into a good college, to find a good career.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Meliena had other plans.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She knew she did not have her mother's genius.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As much as she admired her father's endless work ethic, it intimidated and disgusted her, too.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But she was pretty, she knew that much, and pretty girls had their own avenues to success.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She got to work.</p> <p class="p2">Meliena took three buses after school to get to the modeling agency and later the studios where their photo shoots took place.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She shared part of her modeling income with her parents to help make ends meet, but she never told them how much she really made, either.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She sequestered the rest away.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When she graduated high school (barely) she did go to college – but only because the on-campus dorms were cheaper than anything else downtown.</p> <p class="p2">She vacillated for a few years between two plans: find a well-connected frat boy with a silver spoon in his mouth and ride him into a life of leisure, or seek out an older gentleman, already established and stable, who was in the market for a new, young wife.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She played both angles while she treaded water at school and slowly made a name for herself as a model.</p> <p class="p2">Some weekends she would go from a raucous basement rave on Friday night to an elegant mixer filled with politicians and lobbyists on Saturday.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The first she had a standing invite to up and down fraternity row; the latter she was actually paid to attend, just to add her pretty face to someone's attempt to win the support of someone else.</p> <p class="p2">It was at one of these well-heeled events where she met Jeremy Jones, and her lifelong plan came into focus.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was in manufacturing and finance, increasingly the latter over the former, and the politicians and magnates alike flocked to him in droves.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He had three houses, a lemon yellow sports car, a yacht, and a small jet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was recently divorced.</p> <p class="p2">He was twice her age.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She would be his third wife.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>None of that mattered.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was her ticket.</p> <p class="p2">Meliena always imagined that she would string her quarry along for a while, drive him crazy by fanning and denying his desires, until he would confess he had to have her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Things moved faster than that, and not only because she had to outrun and outmaneuver a number of other ambitious young women with the same plan as her.</p> <p class="p2">She flirted with Jeremy at two functions and finagled an invite to a third event he'd told her he'd be attending.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He laughingly told her that they "had to stop meeting like this" and, to stop the streak, asked if she'd be his plus one at a wedding the next week.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She laughed at his stale joke and accepted.</p> <p class="p2">The wedding turned out to be in Fiji, and while he nobly reserved two hotel rooms, they only made use of one.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She told him before they left for the airport that she had had an incredible time with him and hoped he wasn't about to dispose of her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She made him promise that he'd see her again when they got home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Two weeks later, he took her home after a night on the town.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Two weeks after that she took up semi-permanent residence in his house.</p> <p class="p2">She kept up her modeling and her classes for appearance's sake, worried that dropping them and making Jeremy her full-time occupation would scare him off.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She did, however, direct her agent to aim for more chaste, classy, and refined jobs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Meliena had nailed 'fun and exciting;' now she had to shift into 'respectable marrying material.'</p> <p class="p2">To keep up with Jeremy's occasional shop talk, she registered for Business Essentials and Introduction to Mandarin the next semester.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When he spotted her carefully placed textbook, he asked if she would like to join him on his next trip to Beijing, just as she planned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But he went further than that–he practiced pronunciation with her over dinner.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He made her flash cards.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He found her other textbook–not by her design–and offered to help her prepare for her midterm.</p> <p class="p2">Meliena was taken aback by his recurring thoughtfulness.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She knew he was a kind man–she had made sure of that long before flirting with him–but somehow she had never considered that his kindness would be applied to her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It had only ever entered into her calculations as a decreased chance that he would become demanding or violent (which he never did).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was with some shock that she realized that he respected her, not just wanted her, and that he wanted to support her in the choices she was making.</p> <p class="p2">And so when Jeremy asked her over breakfast what she intended to do with herself once she completed her degree, she froze.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her planned answer–"I thought I'd look into charity work"–which would position her as both noble and in need of lifetime financial support, suddenly felt insufficient.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It felt like a lie.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And now Meliena realized that she respected Jeremy in return.</p> <p class="p2">"You'll laugh," she warned him, and when he promised he wouldn't, she jumped in with both feet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"I want to be the wife of a powerful man.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I want to make him look good when I'm on his arm.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I want to entertain his guests and charm his business partners, and every night I want to fuck him into the floor."</p> <p class="p2">He proposed on the spot.</p> <p class="p2">The wedding a year later could have been mistaken for a finance-and-government networking meeting (and Jeremy closed two deals at the reception and one more the day after), but Meliena would not have had it any other way.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her side of the aisle may have been a little sparser (and less well dressed) than his, but her guests were everyone she wanted to share the special day with.</p> <p class="p2">She stopped modeling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She dropped out of school at the end of the semester.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She settled into a life of socializing, home decor (his houses were all in desperate need), her rigorous beauty and fitness regimen, and high-profile networking events.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She actually did get into charity work, as a natural extension of everything else.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She and her foundation worked hard to increase access to healthcare for marginalized and vulnerable new mothers (like her mother had once been).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And every night, she fucked Jeremy into the flor with practiced technique and genuine enthusiasm.</p> <p class="p2">He brought her to the Tall Pines Refuge a handful of times for various seminars and to view the property.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I never crossed paths with the couple, but we must have dined at opposite ends of the Mess on more than one weekend.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She never really understood the appeal or believed in the necessity of the place, but she trusted him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If he said it was a good idea, it must be.</p> <p class="p2">Of course it turned out he was right, and the world started falling apart.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The two of them were at an after hours mixer attached to a agribusiness and finance convention when rioters burst in from the street with baseball bats and handguns.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Joneses tried to run, tried to hide, but the mob was hunting the bankers they blamed for their lost jobs and hungry children.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The police eventually regained control, but not before they had cornered Jeremy, broken his legs, and beaten him so thoroughly his liver failed.</p> <p class="p2">At the hospital, the doctors explained that he needed a liver transplant to live.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In all the mounting chaos, however, the federal organ donor network was in disarray.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What would have been routine a year before was now an impossibility.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was going to die.</p> <p class="p2">"And the worst part," Meliena told me, "is that just the week before I had realized: I had never fallen in love with Jeremy, but I had grown to love him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I told him so on his… on his death bed."</p> <p class="p2">And he told her two things, in turn.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>First, that he had loved her and had since he asked her to that wedding on Fiji; she had made him feel alive and coming home to her had been the best part of his every day.</p> <p class="p2">But secondly, he insisted that she must not wait for him to die, which was going to take days if not weeks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He made her promise to go, as soon as possible, to the refuge.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It wasn't safe to stay, and the way up the mountain was growing more dangerous each day.</p> <p class="p2">So she left, as promised, the next day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They had made the trip enough times that she packed (for one), drove (without trading off shifts), and hiked (alone) from memory.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She never stopped, not even for gas (the car was electric), not even for police lights, which probably avoided most of the obstacles on the road.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She promised Jeremy that she'd come here, and only after she passed through the front gate did she fall to the ground and cry, sob, bawl.</p> <p class="p2">Meliena hardly noticed the indignities thrust upon her through quarantine, barracks housing, and work detail.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sure, it was not what they'd been promised, but without Jeremy, any lesser deprivation seemed irrelevant.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her only difficulty was Sundays, when no one woke her up in the morning, no one told her where to go, no one told her what to do.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She couldn't even sit outside the rolling garage door of the barracks and stare off into the distant basin without someone trying to engage her in conversation.</p> <p class="p2">By the time it was me disturbing her Sunday afternoon, Meliena had been drawn about halfway out of her shell.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She supposed she had friends; at least, there were a few women she seemed to eat and work with more often than not.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They would chatter around her, but she rarely contributed much to the conversation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What was there to say?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She had been happy, and now she was not.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The very idea that she might be happy again did not seem to occur to her.</p> <p class="p2">I did not know what to do with or for the poor woman once I had her story (she had not once asked me anything about mine).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In a better world, she might respond to therapy, if her loved ones could convince her to go.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But in the refuge, with neither therapists nor loved ones, her future seemed bleak.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Which scared me.</p> <p class="p2">Meliena was an intelligent, capable, and above all very driven woman–her story made that eminently clear.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She might now have no focus, but that hardly meant that she had also lost that drive.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Eventually, something would bring her out of the morass of hopelessness that had claimed her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She would rise like a phoenix reborn.</p> <p class="p2">But what could rouse her from that black pit?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I could think of nothing good that might do the job.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The woman's natural beauty–obscured but not eradicated by poolie living and neglect–might draw the attention of someone with more desire than impulse control.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That would end poorly.</p> <p class="p2">Or if someone heard enough of her story (which she was eager to share with me, once asked; she hated the thought that Jeremy might be forgotten), they could dangle the possibility of her husband's miraculous survival in front of her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was little that woman wouldn't do, I thought, for a reunion with her beloved.</p> <p class="p2">I usually shared brief overviews of my one-on-ones with Maggie, and pointed her at potential prospects, encouraging her to get to know them as well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But I refrained from telling Maggie anything about Meliena for more than a week.</p> <p class="p2">When I finally did mention her, I gave as truncated an account as I could.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Meliena was just a trophy wife, I told Maggie, kicking myself for selling the woman so short.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I said she could use a friend or four, but I didn't think she'd be much use for our network.</p> <p class="p2">I didn't say: this woman is a bomb waiting for just enough jostling to explode.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You could twist her head around to point her at any target you liked, Maggie, and you might just care about her little enough to do just that.</p> <div class="wi_authornotes"> <div> <div class="p-avatar-wrap"><a class="avatar has-link" href="https://scribblehub.com/profile/149271/miriamrobern/"><img id="acc_ava_change
