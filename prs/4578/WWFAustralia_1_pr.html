It does not adequately protect nature and it is delaying the renewable energy and transmission projects needed to rapidly decarbonise the economy.</p><p>Richie Merzian, chief executive of the Clean Energy Investor Group (CEIG) said the government will not meet its renewable energy targets without modern, ﬁt-for-purpose environmental laws underpinning better decision-making.</p><p>“If delivering a clean energy future is a priority for the Albanese government, then reforming the EPBC Act must be too. It is now the single biggest barrier to timely, environmentally responsible, renewable energy development in Australia.”</p><p>CEIG’s recent report, Delivering Major Renewable Energy, identiﬁed major bottlenecks in environmental assessments under the EPBC Act and found many projects now wait more than two years for a federal decision.</p><p>Kelly O’Shanassy, chief executive of the Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF), said, “The EPBC Act’s uncertain and unpredictable assessment and decision-making processes fail to protect nature or support investment in renewable energy. We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to re-shape the law to tackle Australia’s climate and nature crises.”</p><p>The groups are calling for environment laws that enable faster, more eﬃcient and predictable project assessments while improving nature protection, increasing community conﬁdence and empowering indigenous communities to plan an active role in decisions that aﬀect their lands and seas.</p><p>The groups called for legislation that is eﬃcient and protects nature and provides for:</p><p>Kane Thornton, CEO of the Clean Energy Council, said, “Any decision to stall the progress of much-needed Nature Positive reforms to the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act risks missing a crucial opportunity to address one of the most signiﬁcant challenges facing investment in renewable energy projects across Australia.</p><p>“The current iteration of the EPBC Act and its inherent limitations are a cause of signiﬁcant delays to the construction of new renewable energy infrastructure needed to ensure that Australia can meet its renewable energy targets.”</p><p>Dermot O’Gorman, CEO of WWF-Australia, said, “Industry and environment groups are ready to help deliver the Prime Minister’s promise of making Australia a renewable energy superpower —but that won’t be possible unless we ﬁx our failing nature laws.</p><p>“The world is watching as Australia bids to co-host the COP31 climate summit with the Paciﬁc. EPBC reform must be part of our commitment to global climate leadership.</p><p>“We need strong nature laws to ensure the renewable energy transition protects our environment and delivers for communities.”</p><p>Paul Gamblin, CEO of the Australian Marine Conservation Society, said, “Australia has the opportunity to undertake renewable energy development in our oceans responsibly, but we need the Australian Government to show leadership in ﬁlling critical knowledge gaps, and genuinely partner with First Nations peoples, and coastal communities to ensure oﬀshore wind progresses in a fair, inclusive and respectful way.”</p><p>“Where uncertainties remain, we need conﬁdence that stronger nature laws will put eﬀective safeguards in place to ensure that development avoids harming our fragile ocean.”</p><p>Biodiversity Council Co-Chief Councillor Professor Hugh Possingham said “Strong, transparent environmental laws and eﬀective guidance from government are needed to enable Australia to move quickly toward renewable energy while ensuring that we are protecting the unique biodiversity and priceless cultural heritage that makes Australia so special.”</p><p>The Electrical Trades Union’s Michael Wright said “Workforce, training and EPBC assessments are problems that are tangled together. ETU members are ready to build the projects that will power Australia’s clean energy future, but too many projects are currently stuck in the assessment pipeline. </p><p>“Projects with 18 month build times are now spending over two years waiting for EPBC assessments.</p><p>“The uncertainty of the assessment process means there is no reliable pipeline of work for communities, or to train apprentices on anywhere close to the scale we need - an extra 42,500 electricians in the next ﬁve years.</p><p>“Reforming the EPBC Act must be a key priority of the Albanese government. That&#039;s how we can escape this situation where everyone knows where the work is, what it is and roughly when it is, but has no idea who will be doing it.”</p>

Australia also remains a world leader on exporting climate-damaging fossil fuels.</p><p>“Every single tonne of additional coal and gas is putting the future of Australian communities and our iconic reefs, forests and wildlife at risk.</p><p>“We must change course this year to have any hope of a safer climate future.</p><p>“Australia needs to set an emissions reduction target of at least 90% below 2005 levels by 2035 and commit to a phase out of fossil fuels to truly become a renewable energy superpower.</p><p>“We also note the government’s pre-election commitment to hold COP31 in Adelaide, should Australia secure the event. A COP31 hosted by South Australia, a leader in the clean energy, must be a defining moment for Australia to step up and do its part to stabilise warming to 1.5°C. The South Australian and federal governments must work in equal partnership with the Pacific.”</p><p>Mr O’Gorman also urged the new government to deliver on its commitment to be a world leader in ocean protection.</p><p>“Global warming, overfishing and pollution are all having devastating impacts on our oceans,” he said.</p><p>“We’re encouraged by Labor’s commitments to protect our oceans and call on the incoming government to start by ratifying the High Seas Treaty in the first sitting week of the new Parliament.</p><p>“Early and decisive action on nature and climate in the first 100 days is essential to building public trust and creating a sustainable and resilient future.”</p><p>

It covered about 80% of her property in the NSW Northern Rivers Region.</p><p>Considered one of the world&#039;s top 10 invasive species, lantana prevents koalas from moving freely and accessing food trees. It also increases the severity of bushfires, and acts as a fuel ladder carrying flames into tree canopies.</p><p>“Finding out I had koalas was a real highlight but lantana was strangling the place. It was so thick I couldn’t even see the creek. I spent a considerable amount getting rid of some of it,” Barbara said.</p><p>Her concern for the future of her beloved old growth trees and the expense of removing the remaining lantana led to Barbara signing a private conservation agreement covering nearly 51 hectares of her farm.</p><p>In return she knows her trees are safe and Barbara can receive up to $45,000 to fund action – like clearing weeds – to improve the quality of the koala habitat.</p><p>The funding came through a project that encourages private conservation agreements in the Northern Rivers region to protect koala habitat.</p><p>It’s a collaboration between the World Wide Fund for Nature - Australia, the NSW Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water, the NSW Biodiversity Conservation Trust and Envite Environment.</p><p>The project has smashed its target of protecting 500 hectares. Twenty conservation agreements have been signed, or are being finalised, that protect more than 900 hectares.</p><p>“Thanks to money from my conservation agreement we’re discovering what’s actually here because we’re getting though the lantana,” Barbara said.</p><p>“Recently, clearing away the noxious weed revealed a huge eucalypt tree I didn’t even know was there. Ecologists say it’s over 500 years old and has an 11-metre circumference,” she said.</p><p>Barbara removed the cattle being agisted on her farm and Envite Environment planted 1,000 koala trees to reconnect habitat. Traditional Owner visitors say it is very spiritual place.</p><div style="margin: 1em 0;"><img src="https://assets.wwf.org.au/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/v1744241076/img-weed-warriors-koala.png" alt="" style="max-width:100%;" /><p style="font-size: small; color: #555;"><em>A koala on Barbara Linley’s Tullymorgan property</em><br>Credit: Grant Brown</p></div><p>A trail camera revealed some of the property’s rich biodiversity.

I didn’t know they were rare emus,” Barbara said.<strong> </strong></p><p>What Barbara saw was the endangered coastal emu, genetically different from all other emu populations.

The report calls for an end to the misinformation on energy, which is running rife, and blasts the nuclear debate for “wasting time we don’t have.”</p><p>“We’ve seen attempts to create confusion... these distractions are designed to delay action,” said Australian Conservation Foundation CEO Kelly O&#039;Shanassy. </p><p>“The good news is we know how to get this right. This plan charts a way forward towards a future where the renewable energy transition works in harmony with nature,” she said.  </p><p>“The next Australian Parliament must get cracking and agree on a credible energy plan. We have a once in a generation opportunity to get the policy settings right for a transition that tackles both Australia’s climate and nature challenges,&quot; she said. </p><p>The plan identifies key steps that government, industry and communities can take and shows how an energy transition can be done in a way that not only avoids and minimises nature impacts but improves nature overall. </p><p>The report concludes renewable projects must be built in the right places with buffer zones to protect nature and “no-go” zones to include national parks, world heritage areas and key biodiversity areas. </p><p>It finds degraded land should be prioritised for development, along with investment in local energy solutions, and embedding biodiversity gains into every project. 

“Climate action and nature protection are inseparable. Renewables – built in the right places – can not only co-exist safely with nature, but help nature and people thrive,” said Dermot O’Gorman, CEO of WWF-Australia. </p><p>“We must rapidly invest in and deploy renewables to meet the scale and intensity of the climate crisis,” he said. </p><p>The report calls for an urgent overhaul of national and state environmental laws to ensure every project creates net gains and positive outcomes for nature. </p><p>It also calls on governments to invest in Local Energy Hubs to support communities and counter disinformation.</p><p>ACF and WWF-Australia are calling on their combined 2.8 million supporters to get behind this vision and ensure the energy transition creates a bright future for all Australians. </p><p>Additional quotes:  </p><p>“Local Energy Hubs are the most practical way the Federal Government can invest in the information, capacity and tools that communities badly need to ensure that projects contribute to thriving local economies and resilient ecosystems. This election we’ve seen regional communities ask for this support directly. The question is, will the 
government listen?” — Andrew Bray, National Director, RE-Alliance. 

“We need the right policies and laws to compel industry to build projects away from high conservation value lands and help restore biodiversity. This plan is an important step forward in showing how.” — Prof Brendan Wintle, from the University of Melbourne’s School of Agriculture, Food and Ecosystem Sciences  
  
“This plan will help guide the energy transition in a way that benefits nature and local communities. By working together, there are huge opportunities to build projects that will reduce emissions and contribute to the restoration of our natural landscapes.” — Heidi McElnea, Regional Partnerships Coordinator at the Community Power Agency</p>

It is also already hurting our economy and our families. It is fuelling more extreme heatwaves, bushfires, floods and storms, and driving up insurance costs. Our iconic reefs are facing devastating coral bleaching,” she said.</p><p>“The only pathway for a safer climate and a prosperous future is for Australia to end the extraction of fossil fuels for energy and exports and replace it with renewable energy and clean industries.</p><p>“Australia must realise the potential of becoming a renewable energy superpower. This will require the next government to take leadership and urgent action to capture the opportunity of the energy transition that benefits both nature and communities,” she said</p><p>“Australians go to the ballot box on 3 May. Our political leaders must place nature front and centre of their commitments to protect our climate, communities and wildlife.”</p><p>People can send a message to their political leaders and ask them to prioritise nature <a href="https://wwf.org.au/blogs/choose-nature">here</a>.</p>

If a decision is delayed for another 6 months, and if scheduled logging is completed, that adds up to just under 5,400 hectares of additional logging.</p><p><strong>A delay of 6 months could take the total logged area to 12,578 hectares. That equals over 6,700 Sydney Cricket Grounds.</strong></p><p>Indigenous Elder Uncle Micklo Jarrett, a Gumbaynggirr man of the Baga Baga clan, is distraught at logging in Ingalba State Forest which includes sacred Country. <strong>Uncle Micklo Jarrett said:</strong> </p><p><em>One of my main totems is the Dunggirr, the Koala. My identity and my being is sustained, nourished, upheld and defined by the Dunggirr.</em></p><p><em>For years now my totem the Dunggirr has been killed by the Forestry Corporation of NSW including in many, many sites sacred to me and my people such as Little Newry (the eastern edge of our sacred mountain Nunguu Mirrarl). In the southern parts of our Country there are the most important Dunggirr sacred sites and landscapes with dreaming stories and songlines for the Dunggirr extending back for many thousands of years. </em></p><p><em>The main songline is from Yarriabini on the coast to the west through Ingalba. In the last week the Forestry Corporation of NSW has destroyed the best Dunggirr habitats on this songline in forests that the NSW Government promised to protect. </em></p><p><em>For too long now our forests and our totems have been destroyed by the Forestry Corporation despite me and my people asking for it to stop. </em></p><p><em>For the benefit and well-being of all in the Gumbaynggirr Nation we MUST stop logging our forests and the entire 176,000 hectare Great Koala National Park must be declared immediately because that is what our Government promised us.</em></p><p><em>It’s like you are erasing my history, my culture, you have to stop now, you promised us a Great Koala National Park and you have to stop the destruction of my Country.</em></p><div style="margin: 1em 0;"><img src="https://assets.wwf.org.au/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/v1742957361/img-uncle-micklo.png" alt="" style="max-width:100%;" /><p style="font-size: small; color: #555;"><em>Indigenous Elder Uncle Micklo Jarrett</em><br>Credit: Mark Graham</p></div><p>Satellite images make a mockery of claims that selective logging is occurring with conservationists saying that logging will result in a “Swiss cheese” Great Koala National Park because of all the holes left in forest cover. </p><p>A <a href="https://www.climatebiodiversity.org/polling_reveals_majority_support_for_gknp">new poll</a> reveals a large majority of voters support the creation of the Great Koala National Park across the NSW mid-north coast in the state seats of Port Macquarie, Coffs Harbour, and Oxley.</p><p><strong>Bob Debus, Chair of Wilderness Australia said: </strong></p><p><em>If the government wants to create a big national park, with real conservation integrity, that preserves the best remaining habitat for koalas, then they have to stop logging it. </em></p><p><em>To authorise thousands of hectares more logging and then declare them as conservation reserve defies common sense. </em></p><p><em>It has reached the point where I feel the government would be wise to act to put a stop to the ongoing destruction of its promised park.</em></p><p><strong>Darren Grover, Head of Regenerative Country, WWF-Australia said:</strong></p><p><em>The video will be shocking to many people. It shows the brutal efficiency of heavy logging machinery destroying trees which will take many decades to replace, if at all. </em></p><p><em>But Forestry Corp’s hardwood division, the part responsible for native forest logging, is the opposite of efficient. It has run up losses of more than $70 million in the last four years. </em></p><p><em>I’m sure taxpayers are not happy that a state government business has run up losses like this in the process of degrading forests and endangering wildlife.</em></p><p><em>People want this Park. They want to save koalas. Time to make it happen </em></p><p><strong>Gary Dunnett, Chief Executive Officer, National Parks Association of NSW said:</strong></p><p><em>The Great Koala National Park proposal was designed around two basic principles: to protect as much as possible of the core Koala habitats and populations of the region; and to focus exclusively on existing National Parks and State Forests. </em></p><p><em>The reason for concentrating on public lands is that determining their future is the responsibility of the Premier of the day. </em></p><p><em>This report paints a stark picture of what this means for Premier Minns’ reputation- the longer he delays declaring the new park, the more koalas will be needlessly lost.</em></p><p><strong>Jenny Weber, Campaigns Manager, Bob Brown Foundation said:</strong></p><p><em>Every day the shocking destruction continues in Koala habitat in the forests that were promised protection years ago. </em></p><p><em>Premier Minns must stop the bulldozers now. It can and must happen, for koala and greater glider survival, for climate benefits and for the majority of Australians who want native forest logging to end. </em></p>

We need laws that protect our unique wildlife and wild places, which Labor promised to deliver in its nature positive package. Instead we have seen polluting industries put before nature.</p><p>“WWF is pleased to see <a href="https://u26892420.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.vHlFUdi8E30-2FLleparf5P8CYriJn14pQecinowYvumXYOPAwsxwMDExiw3kj-2B8vvqNX92v2E5T6u-2Ba8-2FGdZvnO7nH-2FsAj0saIolmIJqcBEsWWzuFh6TZ2MoRkynhSudxZ2SMojerpwv9ZIOB4kqi1IhYt-2FD9vLVc2meHLh7RbEI-3DhOsO_Uw-2BSbp-2B47TL6dCREokdQZK66SpG7nRaM1EtuKshcX3tMoP2JccEHknh4T3bEUvNrhhL9G6MsvRKkES4GOvgBpe1tmhBmVw9rsAgTLVKUSoFWuI1gek6o4htyfQ7R3sqgJfUKT7bJDWh1tPsxxwjSJdAL62B1kyJncmvM3qhoOe27WQca47Go6hwGANtyLi9HAFmPgb9lFVdOb6xuucNcIPVzkheduiRmNdbKcvjkD3mkRIFydPQkjKDMgPaPyLQn3cYuC834f4pDAMb8abtzZItH0rdypMPXor0UiYZnV4Dxj5iNu0r-2F3zycPUNFlA-2Bj9vKaQs7tEpn9o8ubPNJbCA-3D-3D">Labor recommitting to establishing a national environment protection agency</a> if it wins a second term. This needs to be delivered in the first 12 months of the next Parliament.”</p><p><strong>Budget leaves nature shortchanged</strong></p><p>Tonight’s budget provided modest funds for nature, including $200 million to boost Australia’s network of protected areas and $12 million to deliver increased ocean protection.</p><p>The investment aims to protect another 30 million hectares of land as part of Australia’s commitment to protecting at least 30% of land and sea areas by 2030.</p><p>“This is a welcome contribution to preserving Australia’s wild places, but it will take a lot more than $200 million to protect and manage the diversity of areas important for biodiversity,” said Mr O’Gorman.</p><p>The budget also failed to provide any significant funding for threatened species recovery.</p><p>“This government promised to prevent new extinctions, but has again failed to deliver the funding needed to meet this commitment,” said Mr O’Gorman.</p><p>“Nature is on life support and the government is delaying treatment.”</p><p>The budget included $1.8 billion in energy bill relief payments, but no additional funding to subsidise the cost of household solar, batteries and electric appliances.</p><p>“It’s good to see energy bill relief for those doing it tough, but a more effective way to permanently cut power bills would be targeted measures to electrify and upgrade homes,” said Mr O’Gorman.</p><p>“All Australians should benefit from the cost savings that come from renewable energy - including people who rent, live in an apartment or cannot afford the upfront costs.</p><p>“Basic energy efficiency upgrades combined with solar and battery storage could save an average household $3,039 per year.”</p><p><strong>Nature needs 1% of the national budget</strong></p><p>With an election looming, WWF-Australia is calling on the next Australian Government to invest 1% of the budget into nature.</p><p>“Australia’s biodiversity crisis is a direct result of decades of inadequate funding,” said Mr O’Gorman.</p><p>“A mere $317 million is forecast to be spent on biodiversity over the next financial year. This is less than half a percent of Australia’s budget and a paltry sum for something that is essential to our economy and wellbeing.</p><p>“Investing in nature will not only drive economic growth and job creation, but also safeguard Australian communities and wildlife.”</p><p>People can send a message to their political leaders and ask them to prioritise nature <a href="https://wwf.org.au/get-involved/choose-nature/">here</a>.</p>
