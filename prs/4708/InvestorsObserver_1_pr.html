But investors are starting to look past the glossy margins.</p> <p>After more than doubling from April lows — boosted by optimism tied to President Trump’s<a href="https://investorsobserver.com/news/trump-caved-and-got-zero-in-return-pundits-economists-and-analysts-slam-trumps-trade-deal/"> "Liberation Day" tariff announcement</a> — ARM stock have since fallen nearly 20% from their late July peak. </p> <!-- /investorsobserver_com_article_responsive_1 -->  <p>The selloff began after lackluster earnings and a dismal forecast for the second quarter raised fresh doubts about just how much growth is really left.</p>                 <h3         id="the-growth-problem"                           class="content__heading"     >The growth problem</h3><p>On the surface, the company still looks invincible. Arm boasts 97% gross margins, near-universal adoption of its CPU blueprints, and a royalty model that’s often described as a tollbooth on the semiconductor industry. </p> <p>But as Hataf Capital <a href="https://x.com/hataf_capital/status/1963235999812825452" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">noted</a>, the numbers don’t tell the full story.</p> <p>Revenue is up just 12% year over year, with management guiding for flat results ahead. Nearly half of royalty revenues (45%) come from smartphones, which is a saturated market with limited growth prospects. </p> <p>That leaves Arm tethered to a sector that no longer drives meaningful expansion.</p> <p>Customer concentration adds another layer of risk. Qualcomm accounts for about 10% of Arm’s revenue, yet the two companies remain locked in licensing disputes. Any fracture in that relationship could hit Arm’s top line hard.</p> <p>Even the enviable 97% gross margin comes with a caveat: rising costs have dragged operating margins down into the teens, far below the likes of Nvidia (NVDA), which investors continue to use as the gold standard for AI profitability.</p> <!-- /investorsobserver_com_article_responsive_2 -->                  <h3         id="valuations-stretched-to-the-max"                           class="content__heading"     >Valuations stretched to the max </h3><p>Despite all that, Arm trades at more than 200 times earnings, which is even more expensive than Nvidia. </p> <p>Such a premium implies accelerating growth and expanding profitability. Instead, the company is offering sluggish revenue, rising costs, and legal headaches. </p> <p>For Hataf, the conclusion is simple. Arm is priced like an emerging AI juggernaut but looks more like a mature business chained to slow-growth markets.</p> <p>Hataf isn’t the only ARM bear on Wall Street. The American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) <a href="https://www.aaii.com/investingideas/article/323923-why-arm-holdings-plc8217s-arm-stock-is-down-1155" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">reports</a> that Arm has suffered 18 analyst downgrades in the past month versus just one upgrade. AAII also slapped the stock with a failing value grade, bluntly calling it “ultra expensive.”</p> <p>Much of the concern stems from ARM’s latest pivot. </p> <p>As Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/arm-shares-drop-outlook-disappoints-company-looks-invest-make-own-chips-2025-07-30/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">reported</a>, management now plans to manufacture its own chips. That’s a U-turn from its licensing model and a move that risks alienating key customers like Apple and Qualcomm. </p> <p>Execution risks are sky-high, and the shift raises more questions than answers.</p> <p></p> <!-- /investorsobserver_com_article_responsive_3 -->                                                            </div>

Quite the opposite, the country is now one of the world’s fastest-growing EV markets.</p> <p>In fiscal 2024–25, Indians bought more than 2.03 million electric vehicles — 7.8% of all automobile sales, according to<a href="https://evreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/EVreporter-India-EV-Report-FY24-25.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"> EVReporter</a>.

Tata Motors and Ola Electric are winning market share with cheaper, mass-market EVs designed for Indian buyers. Tesla, meanwhile, looks stuck in a luxury lane few can afford.</p> <p>India isn’t Tesla’s only headache. In Europe, where EV adoption continues to grow, Tesla's market share is slipping fast.</p> <p>As<a href="https://investorsobserver.com/news/stock-update/teslas-europe-nightmare-has-begun/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"> InvestorsObserver reported</a>, Tesla’s sales plunged 40% in July, its seventh straight monthly drop.
