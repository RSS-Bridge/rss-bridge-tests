The most common way for a bird flu to spread to humans is to 'reassort' with a human flu virus, which results in a virus with all of the human flu virus' human adaptations, but with enough new antigens from the bird virus to evade the immune system. Pigs can be infected by both human and bird viruses, so they are a common place for this reassortment to take place. Humans can catch animal diseases without the disease having 'crossed over' to humans, but every viral replication that takes place in a human who has both a bird and a normal human flu gives the virus an extra chance to reassort in a way that produces a bird-antigen-fortified human-adapted flu virus.</div></article></section><section><header><div class="text-center text-3xl mt-3">‚ö°</div><h3 class="text-center font-bold">Quick Links</h3></header><article class="mt-3"><a href="https://avc.xyz/what-will-happen-in-2025-1?utm_source=tldrnewsletter"><b>What Will Happen In 2025 (2 minute read)</b></a><div class="newsletter-html">13 predictions on things that may happen this year.</div></article><article class="mt-3"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/01/internal-spacex-documents-show-the-sweet-stock-deals-offered-to-investors-like-a16z-gigafund/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter"><b>Internal SpaceX documents show the sweet stock deals offered to investors like a16z, Gigafund (7 minute read)</b></a><div class="newsletter-html">a16z was authorized to buy nearly 4.3 million shares for almost $300 million and Gigafund, whose co-founder is a SpaceX board member, was allocated over 1.4 million shares at a cost of nearly $100 million.</div></article><article class="mt-3"><a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@tao/113721192051328193?utm_source=tldrnewsletter"><b>Rejection (2 minute read)</b></a><div class="newsletter-html">It's best not to take rejections personally and move on, but not before fixing any mistakes brought up by the rejection.</div></article><article class="mt-3"><a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/large-established-codebases/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter"><b>Mistakes engineers make in large established codebases (6 minute read)</b></a><div class="newsletter-html">The biggest mistake is not maintaining consistency - consistency protects developers from nasty surprises, slows down codebases' progression into a mess, and allows developers to take advantage of future improvements.</div></article><article class="mt-3"><a href="https://grantslatton.com/how-to-software?utm_source=tldrnewsletter"><b>How to write complex software (11 minute read)</b></a><div class="newsletter-html">This post describes a general method for writing complex software with some specific techniques and guiding heuristics.</div></article><article class="mt-3"><a href="https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents?utm_source=tldrnewsletter"><b>smolagents (GitHub Repo)</b></a><div class="newsletter-html">smolagents is a library that enables users to run powerful agents with a few lines of code.</div></article></section><section></section><section></section><section></section><section></section><section></section><section></section><section></section><section></section><section></section><section></section><section></section><section></section><section></section><section></section><section></section><section></section><section></section><section></section><section></section><section></section><section></section><section></section><section></section><section></section><section></section><section></section><section></section><section></section><section></section><section></section><section></section><section></section><section></section><section></section><section></section><section></section><section></section><section></section><section></section><section></section><section></section><section></section><section></section><section></section><section></section><section></section><section></section><section></section><section></section><section></section><section></section><section></section><section></section><section></section><section></section>
