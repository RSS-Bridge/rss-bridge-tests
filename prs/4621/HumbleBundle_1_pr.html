The Earth is destroyed…but that might be a temporary affair. The first adventure book for the Modern AGE RPG, Five and Infinity explores the Metacosm of the Threefold campaign setting. The book’s five adventures cover all levels of play and can be run individually or connected as a campaign. Furthermore, it introduces the Infinity Engine, a tool for using random chance and choice to generate both original adventures and new planes of existence.

A tabletop rpg about teenagehood, giant bugs, circuit-bent rayguns, and trying to be cool.</p><h3 id="homeworld_revelations_corerulebook"><a id="homeworld_revelations_corerulebook" href="https://cdn.humble.com/humblebundle/ops/pdfs/homeworld_revelations_corerulebook_preview.pdf?t=st=1753105177~exp=1753191577~hmac=cbd6bbb878a5967b25c46b1c7e34827d98cf1b28facfe434c7fc92e1b3f4ccec">Homeworld: Revelations - Core Rulebook</a></h3><img><img src="https://hb.imgix.net/3d9f32778c442c5c1d51a66a0b7c20e55cc50c64.jpg?auto=compress,format&fit=clip&h=350&w=600&s=85ce359cb3ab34e9f1bef69477f0310d"><br><p>Homeworld: Revelations gives fans of the original Homeworld game the exciting opportunity to view the universe from a new perspective, taking on the role of the crew aboard one of the Kushan fleet’s ships.

Some people call it a “rules-light” system, but it has the power and sophistication of games that are much more mechanically heavy—and yet it is substantially more flexible. GMs find the game easy to prep for and easy to run—it frees up the GM’s attention, in prep and at the game table, to focus on cool, creative ideas rather than numbers, mechanics, and “crunch.”</p><p>Cypher System characters are built from the concept up. A descriptive sentence provides not just an easily-understood overview of the character, but also the mechanical basis for skills, abilities, and stats. And the Cypher System gives players amazing narrative engagement, rewarding player-driven subplots and giving players resources to bear on the tasks and situations they most want to succeed at.</p><p>Start a new campaign set in a fantasy land of elves and fae creatures, a science fiction setting spanning the galaxy, or a modern slasher horror game.

Setting up shop in New Orleans, the brilliant Dr. West continues his life's work: the revival of the dead by purely chemical means. To accomplish this task, he recruits Susan Greene, a young and wide-eyed pharmacologist fascinated by his macabre experiments. Initially unfazed by West's unorthodox practices (including how he funds his research - by selling zombie brain fluid as a narcotic), Susan may regret her scientific curiosity as sinister forces - those aligned with Elder Gods and Haitian Voodoo - begin to align against the Reanimator. Dynamite Entertainment proudly resurrects H.P Lovecraft's notorious mad scientist in a fear-fraught tale of Cthulhu tentacle terror and backwater Louisianan superstition! Bonus features include a thorough "History of The Reanimator" prose introduction by writer Keith Davidsen, an insightful and meticulously researched appendix of Lovecraftian references and creator commentary, never-before-seen design illustrations from artist Randy Valiente, and a complete cover gallery featuring the work of Francesco Francavilla, Jae Lee, Andrew Mangum, Nacho Tenorio, and Tim Seeley.</p><h3 id="seductionoftheinnocent"><a id="seductionoftheinnocent" href="https://cdn.humble.com/humblebundle/ops/pdfs/seductionoftheinnocent_preview.pdf?t=st=1753105180~exp=1753191580~hmac=e593cad60b5af6dc3dc8cd6a4d5de9469d02a05fce9de85b995a81ef17251e96">Seduction of the Innocent</a></h3><img><img src="https://hb.imgix.net/641b931d6212bcff5191deba668fb7fc25abd038.jpg?auto=compress,format&fit=clip&h=350&w=600&s=70fdca98b0c8e8a97ecab21fe2a805e7"><br><p>FBI Agent Thomas Jennings has just arrived in San Francisco, fresh-faced and ready to tackle crime in the big city... but he's not nearly prepared for what he's about to encounter. The city's crime lords are being systematically murdered, and those responsible are the stuff of his nightmares. In a desperate race to end the spree killings and rescue two targeted and helpless children, Jennings will be forced to question every belief he holds dear... and struggle to hold onto his humanity. Gritty, sometimes depraved crime fiction in the tradition of James Elroy, Jim Thompson, and EC-era crime and horror comics, Seduction of the Innocent reunites writer Ande Parks and artist Esteve Polls, the acclaimed creative team that brought you The Death of Zorro and The Lone Ranger.</p></div>

These days we have the whole world at our fingertips, so shouldn’t happiness be just as readily available? As more people continue to retire, they are finding themselves in this strange stage of life that has never been better, but it doesn’t feel better. In spite of the fact that they may be doing well financially, in spite of modern technology, the internet, and greater total wealth than at any other time in history, happiness seems to be leveling off, if not declining. Wealthfulness is the balance of wealth and happiness, the combination of monetary success and meaningfulness. What financial endeavors are the wisest choices for us?

They live paycheck to paycheck, in constant danger of job loss or unexpected expenses. Following decades of rising income instability and falling savings—not to mention the twin economic upheavals of the Great Recession and the COVID-19 pandemic—they have become the new normal. Rather than treat “Tightropers” as victims or blame them for their financial decisions, Teetering lets them tell their own stories of setbacks, sacrifice, and perseverance, and provides original research into their unique pressures and needs. Tightropers deserve support at all stages of their lives to build savings for both daily emergencies and long-term retirement. Teetering shows how legislators and regulators can make a difference without unintended consequences and how financial technology innovation can help Tightropers manage their money in uncertain times. Teetering makes the case for urgent action by financial institutions, investors, regulators, policymakers, employers, and influencers to recognize and address the financial forces that have pushed the American dream out of reach for so many. It proposes common ground solutions that work regardless of political leaning and provides a roadmap for how innovators can serve this growing need and how banks and others can start saying “yes” to their customers again.</p><h3 id="familynestegg"><a id="familynestegg">The Family Nest Egg</a></h3><img><img src="https://hb.imgix.net/7f655000c52424cefe3fa8cc6c0bbc213175313b.jpg?auto=compress,format&fit=clip&h=350&w=600&s=0a63aadc36cd9862990bcc269a538cda"><br><p>Learn how to earn and save more money while protecting your finances and your family.

Once a prosperous land teeming with mythical beasts and beings, it now rots from the inside, tainted by unknown forces. Odin’s chosen guardians of the realm are gone. In their absence, the sacred Elder Tree they swore to protect is exposed to abuse and manipulation. Now, the only remnants of hope reside in Estra, the daughter of mankind’s last great leader. <br><br>With a heavy emphasis on narrative, Estra’s journey through Midgard is filled with Nordic lore, mysterious twists, and consequential decisions. Players will converse with a variety of characters and share in Estra’s discoveries as she learns more about her family’s past and the looming darkness spreading across the realm. <br><br>Estra’s path is fraught with difficult decisions and untrustworthy characters that can lead her astray. Her story is intertwined with the player’s ability to discern fact from fiction and to decide right from wrong. Avoid battle, help companions, save your people, but remember that the consequences are Estra’s to bear.<br><br>Along the way, players must solve incrementally challenging puzzles that reveal insightful secrets, fantastical abilities, and hidden passageways. While trial and error is useful, patience is necessary. Not every problem allows for multiple mistakes and failure is most certainly an option. The answers you seek may be lost if you make the wrong decision. <br><br>Violence isn’t always necessary, but, when push comes to shove, ATONE’s combat is a delicate dance of sword and axe. Combat is grounded in the rhythm game genre and the mechanics of titles like Guitar Hero and Dance Dance Revolution. Music is a crucial component, with each fight receiving its very own song.<br><br>ATONE’s music and sound design are composed by a variety of incredible artists, including: Julian Ratschiller, Australian artist Luminist (a.k.a. James Shuar), who blends a synth-heavy score with the digitally corrupted sounds of period-specific instruments, and Andrew Prahlow, whose name can be attributed to the critically acclaimed hit <i> Outer Wilds </i> and epics like <i> Star Wars </i> and <i> Blade Runner</i>.<h3 id="mythicocean"><a id="mythicocean" href="https://youtu.be/tPtOQnJ2_f4">Mythic Ocean</a></h3><img src="https://hb.imgix.net/e36ba40e3ea0f9e95c9e2e4c0e2a378bee7ce0e9.png?auto=compress,format&w=300&s=d048455948f8643fd1f7bf1d644c2fbe"><img><br>What would you do if you were friends with the gods, and your influence on them could change the universe? <i>Mythic Ocean</i> is an atmospheric and charming adventure where you'll befriend a pantheon of gods under the sea, help them find themselves, and make choices that shape the creation of a new world. <br><br>Explore all the outcomes.

Hyperspace opened the door to the stars, but habitable worlds are few and far in between, overpopulation is still rampant, and our civilization's appetite for resources has only increased. For over a hundred years, the incredibly rich Dust Zone sated this endless appetite, jointly controlled by the United Earth Nations and the Zone Mining Cooperative. But humanity’s fighting chance only lasted for a short hundred years. <br><br>Now, it has gone dark. Freighters stopped arriving with supply hauls and humanity is facing an unprecedented crisis. It's up to the commander of UEN's finest fleet, to deploy into the Dust Zone, investigate, and solve the supply chain crisis before it spirals out of control. It's time to demonstrate strategic aptitude in a turn-based management mode. Then, head to the front lines and channel your inner commander in intense, real-time space battles.<br> <ul> <li>Command an entire space fleet and survive in the most hostile environment known to man. Secure strategic nodes, harvest the Dust Zone's resources, and expand the fleet to confront the threat to humanity's survival.</li> <li>Customize each individual ship using a detailed designer. Upgrade every vessel with newly researched hulls, modules, and of course, weapons. Every upgrade matters, not just on the ships themselves.</li> <li>Complete side missions to unlock additional fleet stations and strategic options. These can provide one-of-a-kind bonuses in battles, from extra build queues to support powers - potentially turning the tide of the battle at hand or even the entire war.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Take command of a custom fleet in intense 4x real-time tactical battles, maneuvering them in a fully 3D combat space.</li> <li>Employ complex, tactical maneuvers to gain the upper hand and defeat superior foes through cunning and strategic brilliance.</li> <li>Summon reinforcements and support powers from adjacent sectors to influence the direction of the battle.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Never give up and keep the fight going in the Sector Assault mode to generate a fully randomized starmap, side missions, and enemies, for fresh challenges each time.</li> <li>Use the robust campaign editor and mod.io integration to create and easily share new campaigns with fellow players and craft personalized challenges!</li> </ul><h3 id="menofwar_assaultsquad2"><a id="menofwar_assaultsquad2" href="https://youtu.be/sqybvSKz550">Men of War: Assault Squad 2</a></h3><img src="https://hb.imgix.net/db000c3e492ba58e374fedc6158058fd6f90f691.png?auto=compress,format&w=300&s=b0a4b1253ffca555f048a343145f11f6"><img><br><html>  <head><base href="https://rss-bridge.org/bridge01/" target="_blank">  </head>  <body>   <strong>    <i>Men of War: Assault Squad 2</i>   </strong>   features new single player style skirmish modes that take players from extreme tank combat to deadly sniper stealth missions.

It's also "a sequel to [Arcen's] enormo-space RTS AI War, which we called <strong> 'one of this year's finest strategy games' </strong> back in 2009" (Tom Sykes, PC Gamer) <strong class="hmb"> <br><br>The most devious and acclaimed artificial intelligence in strategy gaming returns... with a host of mutual enemies. </strong> <br><br>Face off against a more advanced version of the original AI, who once again has captured the entire galaxy leaving you only a tiny planet to yourself. Then strike out and find a way to cleverly outwit it nonetheless. All the new capturables, larger fleets, and hacking abilities are sure to help. (You're going to need it.) <br><br>Or immerse yourself in a far more complicated galactic struggle involving the nanocaust, macrophages, dyson spheres, and more. Other factions each have their own goals, rules, units, and entirely unique economies. Make the scenario complicated enough and it can become "World War XV is in progress, you're in a tiny farm in the middle of it, nobody likes you, but if you can just kill that one giant angry enemy leader this will all be over." <br><br>If that sounds over the top -- and frankly that bit is wearying to us to imagine even though some people seek it out -- then take a break and maybe hack the all-consuming computer virus to be your ally, and convince the star-sized alien hives to watch your back as you take on a suddenly-less-arrogant AI. <br><br><i> (If you're really feeling spiteful, take yourself out of the equation, turn on super fast forward, and watch them all fight like ants on a galactic scale.)</i><strong class="hmb"><br><br>Modernized and supercharged. </strong> <br><br>It's been ten years since the original AI War launched, and the gaming world has changed a lot -- as has the available computing power on any device you're using to read this. We've pulled out all the stops to build foes more formidable and intelligent than before, and to create simulations of hundreds of thousands of units running at 120fps in a lot of cases. You can speed up and slow down the simulation without any extra load on your CPU, and pause at will. <br><br>The interface respects your time by automating things that you would do the same 95% of the time anyway. For that other 5% there are indeed advanced features such as placing spy nanites, tweaking or disabling the rules of automation, or redesigning your fleet compositions as much as you want. <strong class="hmb"> <br><br>Streamlined, yet deeper. </strong> <br><br>Sometimes when a sequel says it's "streamlined," it can really mean "dumbed down." And there are indeed fewer tiny choices to be made in some areas here: you don't have to decide how to wash each dish; you have a dishwasher. And it's a good thing you do, to be honest, because the rabbit hole of complex and confounding scenarios goes as deep as you want it to. <br><br>All those bits where you make the interesting strategic decisions? Those bits are tougher than ever, and you can't fall back on old boring habits to muddle through. You need your attention free to anticipate, to plan, to dream... and then throw those all aside and figure it out by the seat of your pants when everything goes sideways. <br><br>There's too much to memorize (but tooltips are always right there, anyway), and there's always an unfamiliar element. Clicking fast won't help you. To win the AI War, you'll have to improvise, adapt, and use your wits. <br><br>As it should be. <strong class="hmb"> <br><br>How About Some Highlights? </strong> <br> <ul> <li>Many optional factions, each with their own goals and strategies, create a living galaxy.</li> <li>A new Fleets system gives you even more ships than before, and allows you to customize your empire more than ever.</li> <li>A ton of map types, and with a lot of sub-options to make them even more varied.</li> <li>Outguard to hire, factions to ally with, and oodles of targets to capture or hack --with the AI or aliens.</li> <li>Warden, Hunter, and Praetorian Guard sub-fleets of the AI provide for new challenges (and sometimes opportunities) in how both you and the AI interact with each other.</li> <li>Crazy moddability, with many levers available in easily-accessible XML.</li> </ul> <strong class="hmb"> <br><br>What's New Compared To The Original? </strong> <br><br> <ul> <li>More approachable gameplay, but with a rabbit hole that goes as deep as ever.</li> <li>More to do, in terms of moment to moment gameplay and choices. More to find, more to conquer or be conquered-by.</li> <li>Polished gameplay mechanics, representing everything learned from first game’s six expansions (plus three years of development on this sequel).</li> <li>Trimmed fat: repetitive boring tasks have been automated or streamlined, but more options than ever have been added for you to customize things when you want to. Our goal is never to waste your time, but always have an array of interesting challenges for you to pursue at once.</li> <li>Redesigned UI that gives you a ton of information and power right when you need it.</li> <li>1.5 hours of new music added to the 4.5 hour included score from the original game.</li> <li>Multithreading for modern performance, and a codebase that will not summon an elder god (recoded from the ground up for modern rigs).</li> <li>Over 1900 lines of spoken dialogue from more than 25 actors.</li> </ul><h3 id="stronghold_definitiveedition"><a id="stronghold_definitiveedition" href="https://youtu.be/sYc9rD9Wl4Q">Stronghold: Definitive Edition</a></h3><img src="https://hb.imgix.net/d193b259ce27375e88206c776b244005dbd20de7.png?auto=compress,format&w=300&s=24c906a6547f723673cc611670652026"><img><br>Relive the glory of Stronghold, the original BAFTA-nominated real-time strategy game, with this new definitive edition of the classic 'castle sim'.

Originally written by Linus Torvalds, Linux is widely used, and many developers and technology companies use Linux and Unix, a Linux-based operating system developed about fifty years ago. With both Linux and Unix gaining popularity, it is instrumental in managing very large networks in corporations such as Intel, IBM, and Amazon, and is also used to run offices and homes in some developed countries.</p><p>How does Linux technically work? As you work through the course, you will learn that Linux is an operating system just as Windows is; however, the difference is that Linux is an open-source operating system that uses a VirtualBox. The VirtualBox reinforces the capacity of your computer to run multiple operating systems on one set of hardware at the same time. You will be taught that Redhat, CentOS, Fedora, and SuSe are some of the main Linux operating systems, and that others include Debian and Ubuntu.</p><p>As you will discover by the end of this Linux fundamentals course, the operating system stores data on disk drives through a filesystem that consists of files and directories and that information is needed to access and locate them. You will need to learn Linux commands if you want to navigate a file system and these commands are discussed in-depth in this Linux tutorial for beginners’ course, along with practical examples. There are various types of commands, including those of file maintenance, file display, file system monitoring, and file network, and you will learn to master these and gain a better understanding of the power of the Linux system.</p><p>By the end of this course, you will be skilled with the fundamental Linux command line, have knowledge of Linux basic system administration, and have a better grasp of how Linux functions.</p><p>All the resources for this course are available at: https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Linux-Crash-Course-for-Beginners</p><h3 id="hands-onlinux_self-hostedwordpressforlinuxbeginners"><a id="hands-onlinux_self-hostedwordpressforlinuxbeginners" href="https://youtu.be/nGGPatE3j-g">Hands-on Linux - Self-Hosted WordPress for Linux Beginners</a></h3><img><img src="https://hb.imgix.net/2bbe263e5525cdcdd9e6031fdb04b8814e31b938.jpg?auto=compress,format&fit=clip&h=350&w=600&s=a462838d656f0f80413dfea34313da3f"><br><p>Embark on a transformative learning experience, starting from basic Linux server setup to deploying and managing a full-featured WordPress website.
