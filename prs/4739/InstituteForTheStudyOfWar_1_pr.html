A Ukrainian servicemember operating in Myrnohrad told Hromadske that the Russian forces operating in northern Pokrovsk and northeastern Myrnohrad &#8220;feel completely at ease&#8221; and that Russian first-person view (FPV) drone operators are within range to interdict Ukrainian GLOCs connecting Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad. An officer of a Ukrainian unit operating in Myrnohrad told Hromadske that Russian forces have almost complete fire control over the narrow Ukrainian GLOC supplying Myrnohrad. The porous nature of the frontline and ubiquity of drones in this area continue to obscure the tactical picture in Pokrovsk, and ISW will provide an updated assessment as the situation becomes clearer.</p>    <p></p>    <p><strong>Ukrainian forces conducted a heliborne air assault operation west of Pokrovsk on October 31. </strong>The Ukrainian 7th Rapid Reaction Corps of the Air Assault Forces reported on November 1 that Ukrainian forces conducted a successful air assault operation near Pokrovsk.[7] Ukrainian Main Military Intelligence Directorate (GUR) sources told Ukrainian broadcaster Suspilne on October 31 that elements of the GUR Special Forces conducted the operation, which involved multiple helicopters, and entered areas that the Russian military command previously claimed to have seized.[8] The GUR sources stated that these areas are critically important for Ukrainian logistics in the Pokrovsk direction. Geolocated footage published on October 31 shows Ukrainian servicemembers disembarking from a UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter west of Pokrovsk in an area where Russian sources previously claimed that Russian forces maintained a presence.[9] The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) claimed on November 1 that Russian forces repelled the Ukrainian counterattack.[10] A Russian milblogger noted on November 1 that the ability of Ukrainian helicopters to penetrate into airspace saturated with Russian drones without sustaining losses “raises questions,” presumably about the strength of the Russian air defense umbrella in the Pokrovsk direction.[11]</p>    <p></p>   <div class="conflict-map-block"><a href="https://understandingwar.org/map/assessed-control-of-terrain-in-the-pokrovsk-direction-november-1-2025-at-130-pm-et/" title="Assessed Control of Terrain in the Pokrovsk Direction, November 1, 2025 at 1:30 PM ET" class="map-link" target=""><a href="https://understandingwar.org/map/assessed-control-of-terrain-in-the-pokrovsk-direction-november-1-2025-at-130-pm-et/"><style>  	.fancybox__container {      	z-index: 10002 !important; /* Choose a value that ensures it appears above other elements */  	}  	/* Image container styles */  	.image-container {  		position: relative;  		display: inline-block;  		overflow: hidden;  	}    	.zoomable-image {  		max-width: 100%;  		cursor: pointer;  		transition: transform 0.3s ease;  	}    	/* Add zoom icon on hover using a pseudo-element */  	.zoomable-image::after {  		content: '🔍';  		position: absolute;  		top: 8px;  		right: 8px;  		background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6);  		color: white;  		font-size: 18px;  		padding: 5px;  		border-radius: 50%;  		opacity: 0;  		transition: opacity 0.3s ease;  		pointer-events: none;  	}    	.image-container:hover .zoomable-image::after {  		opacity: 1;  	}    	/* Modal styles */  	.modal {  		display: none;  		position: fixed;  		z-index: 10002;  		left: 0;  		top: 0;  		width: 100%;  		height: 100%;  		overflow: auto;  		background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);  		align-items: center;  		justify-content: center;  		display: flex;  	}    	.modal-content {  		max-width: 90%;  		max-height: 90%;  		display: flex;  		align-items: center;  		justify-content: center;  	}    	.modal-content img {  		max-width: 100%;  		max-height: 100%;  		transition: transform 0.3s ease;  	}    	.close {  		position: absolute;  		top: 20px;  		right: 30px;  		font-size: 40px;  		color: white;  		cursor: pointer;  	}    	.zoom-controls {  		position: absolute;  		bottom: 20px;  		right: 30px;  		display: flex;  		gap: 10px;  	}    	.zoom-controls button {  		font-size: 24px;  		background-color: #ffffff;  		border: none;  		padding: 8px;  		border-radius: 4px;  		cursor: pointer;  		transition: background-color 0.2s ease;  	}    	.zoom-controls button:hover {  		background-color: #e0e0e0;  	}    </style>  <img decoding="async" src="https://understandingwar.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Pokrovsk-Direction-November-01-2025-scaled.webp" class="zoomable-image" alt="Map Thumbnail" style="max-width:100%;" height="auto" width="100%" data-large="" data-type="image"></a></a></div><div class="conflict-map-title" data-map-title="Assessed Control of Terrain in the Pokrovsk Direction, November 1, 2025 at 1:30 PM ET"></div><div class="conflict-map-id" data-map-id="110555"></div>   <p></p>   <div class="conflict-map-block"><a href="https://understandingwar.org/map/assessed-control-of-terrain-in-pokrovsk-and-myrnohrad-november-1-2025-at-130-pm-et/" title="Assessed Control of Terrain in Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad, November 1, 2025 at 1:30 PM ET" class="map-link" target=""><a href="https://understandingwar.org/map/assessed-control-of-terrain-in-pokrovsk-and-myrnohrad-november-1-2025-at-130-pm-et/"><img decoding="async" src="https://understandingwar.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Pokrovsk-and-Myrnohrad-November-01-2025-scaled.webp" class="zoomable-image" alt="Map Thumbnail" style="max-width:100%;" height="auto" width="100%" data-large="" data-type="image"></a></a></div><div class="conflict-map-title" data-map-title="Assessed Control of Terrain in Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad, November 1, 2025 at 1:30 PM ET"></div><div class="conflict-map-id" data-map-id="110556"></div>   <p></p>    <p><strong>Close combat, urban terrain, and weather conditions are impacting Ukrainian and Russian drone warfare and Russian infiltration tactics in and around Pokrovsk</strong>. A Ukrainian officer told Hromadske on October 31 that Ukrainian infantry operating on the forward edges do not regularly engage Russian forces in close combat, as Russian forces instead engage Ukrainian drone and mortar crews in near rear areas.[12] ISW has recently observed reports that Russian infiltration groups are deliberately engaging Ukrainian drone and artillery crews in Pokrovsk to inhibit Ukrainian strikes.[13] A Ukrainian drone operator told Hromadske that the threat of Russian infiltration groups is forcing Ukrainian drone operators to limit the duration of drone flights because the drone operators also have to engage in small arms combat to repel Russian infiltrations in the near rear.[14] The Ukrainian drone operator stated that constant Russian infiltrations into Pokrovsk are forcing Ukrainian forces to pull back the second echelon of drone operators, preventing Ukrainian forces from striking Russian forces on the outskirts of Pokrovsk. A high-ranking Ukrainian officer told Hromadske that about 30 to 40 Russian personnel can infiltrate into Pokrovsk when rainy or foggy weather inhibits Ukrainian drone operations, while no more than 10 Russian soldiers can infiltrate during fair weather when Ukrainian forces can operate drones. ISW has observed reports that Russian forces intensify infiltration efforts during poor weather and that precipitation inhibits both Russian and Ukrainian drone operations.[15] Another Ukrainian drone pilot indicated to Hromadske that Russian and Ukrainian forces in Pokrovsk are fighting for control over high-rise buildings and elevated terrain from which to conduct drone operations, particularly against enemy GLOCs at a distance of 30 kilometers.[16]</p>    <p></p>    <p><strong>Ukrainian forces struck Russian oil infrastructure in Moscow Oblast on the night of October 31 to November 1. </strong>The Ukrainian Main Military Intelligence Directorate (GUR) reported that Ukrainian forces struck three lines of the Koltsevoy oil refinery in Ramensky Raion, Moscow Oblast, and geolocated footage published on October 31 shows explosions at the pipeline.[17] The GUR reported that the Koltsevoy pipeline is 400 kilometers long and transports fuel from the Ryazan, Novgorod, and Moscow oil refineries. The GUR reported that the Koltsevoy pipeline could pump up to 7.4 million tons of fuel annually, including three million tons of aviation fuel, 2.8 million tons of diesel fuel, and 1.6 million tons of gasoline. The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) claimed that Russian forces downed 11 drones over Moscow Oblast overnight.[18]</p>    <p></p>    <p><strong>Polish fighter jets intercepted a Russian reconnaissance aircraft over the Baltic Sea for the third time in three days, and German officials reported an unidentified drone incursion near the Berlin Brandenburg Airport. </strong>The Polish Armed Forces Operational Command reported on October 31 that two Polish MiG-29 fighter jets intercepted a Russian Il-20 reconnaissance aircraft in international airspace over the Baltic Sea on October 31.[19] The Polish Armed Forces Operational Command noted that the Russian aircraft was operating without a registered flight plan or an active transponder but did not violate Polish airspace. Polish fighter jets also intercepted Russian reconnaissance aircraft on October 29 and 30.[20] German authorities at the Berlin Brandenburg Airport confirmed on November 1 that German police spotted an unidentified drone flying near the airport on the evening of October 31, forcing the airport to suspend flights for two hours and divert 11 aircraft.[21]</p>    <p></p>    <p><strong>Russian authorities continue cracking down on Russian social media sources who share insider information about the Kremlin and Russian security services. </strong>Russian insider channel <em>VChK-OGPU-Info</em> reported on October 31 that Telegram administrators blocked the main <em>VChK-OGPU </em>channel at the behest of Russian authorities for alleged “doxxing and extortion.”[22] <em>VChK-OGPU-Info</em> claimed that Telegram removed other channels considered &#8220;irritants&#8221; to Russian law enforcement and intelligence agencies and that only Telegram management could have removed the account from Telegram. The channel also claimed that Russian forces detained one of the channel&#8217;s authors in St. Petersburg on October 30. <em>VChK-OGPU </em>claims to have sources affiliated with Russian law enforcement and has offered purported insights into Kremlin factional dynamics, internal assessments of Russian government policies, significant changes in the Russian MoD, and leaks of information regarding the MoD and Russian military.[23]</p>    <p></p>    <p>The Kremlin likely targeted <em>VChK-OGPU </em>as part of a wider effort to cleanse the Russian information space of sources that publish information that the Kremlin deems threatening to the regime&#8217;s stability. Telegram first deleted the <em>VChK-OGPU</em> channel and several other channels in April 2025, reportedly at the behest of Russian authorities, forcing <em>VChK-OGPU</em> to rely on a backup.[24] Russian law enforcement also detained three employees of the state-owned Ural regional information agency Ura.ru in June 2025 for allegedly receiving funding from an organization designated as a foreign agent and bribing Russian law enforcement to obtain sensitive internal reports.[25] Russian authorities raided in late July 2025 the offices of Baza, a Russian outlet affiliated with Russian law enforcement, as part of an abuse of power investigation against Russian police officers who allegedly disclosed sensitive information to Baza.[26] Both publications notably maintained relations within Russia’s internal government systems and previously published information that the Russian government seemingly hoped to withhold from domestic and foreign audiences.</p> </div>   <div class="gb-container gb-container-6d9519ed" data-id="key-takeaways" title="Key Takeaways"> <div class="gb-container gb-container-9851fc54 form-wrapper-mobile">  <h2 class="gb-headline gb-headline-249caf6f gb-headline-text">Key Takeaways</h2>    <ol class="wp-block-list"> <li class="has-main-white-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-ce3fcfe5078e1133effdd7345f2c6254">Russian forces are intensifying offensive operations in and around Pokrovsk to seize the town.</li>    <li class="has-main-white-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-12dbd4d83f247052e4f19eed103450f5">Ukrainian forces conducted a heliborne air assault operation west of Pokrovsk on October 31.</li>    <li class="has-main-white-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-2aef0f52dbf3decdee64ed5125621c87">Close combat, urban terrain, and weather conditions are impacting Ukrainian and Russian drone warfare and Russian infiltration tactics in and around Pokrovsk.</li>    <li class="has-main-white-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-ec1bef09d1ab524441a51e33017cfb2d">Ukrainian forces struck Russian oil infrastructure in Moscow Oblast on the night of October 31 to November 1.</li>    <li class="has-main-white-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-ffa2f5710d152564e9b498317d8b9354">Polish fighter jets intercepted a Russian reconnaissance aircraft over the Baltic Sea for the third time in three days, and German officials reported an unidentified drone incursion near the Berlin Brandenburg Airport.</li>    <li class="has-main-white-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-fb8191db807c5641c9197662755b3976">Russian authorities continue cracking down on Russian social media sources who share insider information about the Kremlin and Russian security services.</li>    <li class="has-main-white-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-366d9c24a5717a5a477fa5168eeb30bf">Ukrainian forces recently advanced near Lyman.

on October 31 and November 1.[28] Russian milbloggers claimed that Ukrainian forces counterattacked near Stepne (northwest of Sumy City) and Varachyne (north of Sumy City).[29]</p>    <p></p>    <p>Ukrainian electronic and radio warfare expert Serhiy &#8220;Flash&#8221; Beskrestnov reported on November 1 that Russian forces used a Molniya mothership unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with two first-person view (FPV) drones to strike a minibus in Mykolaivka (west of Sumy City) about 36 kilometers from the frontline.[30] Beskrestnov noted that Russian forces control the Molniya mothership drones via local mobile internet networks and fly these motherships through areas with stable mobile coverage before dropping the FPVs roughly five to 10 kilometers from the target.[31]</p>    <p></p>    <p>The Russian milblogger, reportedly affiliated with the Russian Northern Grouping of Forces, claimed that the Russian military command deliberately continues to refuse to rotate servicemembers of

Hejazi is reportedly one of Khamenei’s closest advisers and is considered the “most powerful intelligence official” in Iran, according to five sources familiar with Khamenei’s decision-making process.[4] Pakpour previously served as the IRGC Ground Forces commander and Khamenei appointed Pakpour as IRGC commander after Israel killed former IRGC Commander Hossein Salami during the Israel-Iran War.[5] The X account attributed to Mossad previously accurately reported that Khamenei had appointed Ali Abdollahi Ali Abadi as the new Khatam ol Anbia Central Headquarters commander before the regime officially announced the appointment.[6] The account’s claim that Pakpour and Hejazi have sidelined Khamenei, if true, would be extremely noteworthy as it would indicate that Khamenei is currently not the main decision-making authority in Iran.</p>    <p><strong>Hezbollah is reconstituting its forces and weapons capabilities, according to the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>.[7]<em> </em>This report comes amid recent concerns about a potential resumption of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. </strong>Unspecified sources familiar with Israeli and Arab intelligence told the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> on October 30 that Hezbollah is restoring its weapons stockpiles and rebuilding its military forces after the Israel-Hezbollah conflict in late 2024.[8] Israel destroyed over half of Hezbollah’s weapons stockpile during the conflict.[9] The unspecified sources stated that Hezbollah is restocking its rockets, anti-tank missiles, and artillery via smuggling and domestic production.[10] Hezbollah has reportedly acquired some of these weapons via Lebanese seaports and ground lines of communication between Lebanon and Syria.[11] Senior Israeli officials recently noted that Hezbollah has managed to smuggle “hundreds” of rockets from Syria into Lebanon in recent months.[12] Iran has historically supplied Hezbollah with weapons and funding using ground lines of communication that cross Syria.[13] Hezbollah is also domestically manufacturing new weapons, according to one of the sources.[14] Israeli security sources recently told an Israeli journalist that Hezbollah has resumed producing precision and long-range missiles.[15] Arab intelligence officials stated that Hezbollah is returning to a more decentralized structure similar to how the group operated in the 1980s. The sources noted that Hezbollah has recruited new fighters to fill its ranks, but that its military leadership remains in disarray.[16] Israel killed a significant number of Hezbollah’s senior leadership during the conflict in late 2024. Israel was reportedly &#8220;angered” by<strong> </strong>the new intelligence findings and lamented<strong> </strong>that the issue has shifted from Hezbollah’s disarmament to rearmament in “just a few months.”[17] Israeli media reported on October 30 that Israel is considering intensifying its attacks in Lebanon to respond to Hezbollah’s attempt to reconstitute.[18] US and European officials recently warned about the possibility of a large-scale Israeli operation targeting Hezbollah.[19]</p>    <p><strong>Delays in the implementation of the Lebanese Armed Forces’ (LAF) plan to disarm Hezbollah likely enabled Hezbollah to reconstitute some of its capabilities. </strong>Hezbollah has been reconstituting its forces and capabilities since the November 2024 Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire agreement.[20] Hezbollah has increased its reconstitution activity in recent weeks due to a ”significant slowdown&#8221; in LAF operations, according to Israeli military intelligence.[21] The LAF plan, which the Lebanese government approved in September 2025, stipulates that the LAF will disarm Hezbollah south of the Litani River by the end of 2025. The LAF has conducted basic seizures of Hezbollah weapons caches, but CTP-ISW has not observed any instances of Hezbollah fighters turning weapons over to the state.[22] Israel and Lebanon have also been unable to reach an agreement on the timeline for disarming Hezbollah, which has reportedly caused delays in the implementation of the LAF’s plan.[23] The Lebanese government has consistently claimed that Israeli airstrikes have prevented the LAF from fully deploying its forces to southern Lebanon and efficiently disarming Hezbollah.[24] Any delay in the implementation of the LAF disarmament plan gives Hezbollah more time to try to reconstitute as a military organization.</p>    <p></p>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="791" height="1024" src="https://understandingwar.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-10-31-OnePager-3-791x1024.webp" alt="Iran Update, October 31, 2025" class="wp-image-110491" srcset="https://understandingwar.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-10-31-OnePager-3-791x1024.webp 791w, https://understandingwar.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-10-31-OnePager-3-232x300.webp 232w, https://understandingwar.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-10-31-OnePager-3-768x994.webp 768w, https://understandingwar.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-10-31-OnePager-3-1187x1536.webp 1187w, https://understandingwar.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-10-31-OnePager-3-1583x2048.webp 1583w, https://understandingwar.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-10-31-OnePager-3-scaled.webp 1978w" sizes="(max-width: 791px) 100vw, 791px" /></figure>    <p></p> </div>   <div class="gb-container gb-container-6d9519ed" data-id="key-takeaways" title="Key Takeaways"> <div class="gb-container gb-container-9851fc54 form-wrapper-mobile">  <h2 class="gb-headline gb-headline-249caf6f gb-headline-text">Key Takeaways</h2>    <ol class="wp-block-list"> <li class="has-main-white-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-805e1434690e9f170d5feeb565b2f64e"><strong>Iranian Decision-Making: </strong>An X account attributed to Mossad claimed on October 30 that Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei’s Deputy Chief of Staff for Political and Security Affairs, Ali Asghar Hejazi, and IRGC Commander Major General Mohammad Pakpour have sidelined Khamenei and are “making decisions independently.” CTP-ISW cannot verify this claim.

The MoU comes after the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which is based in Kurdish-majority areas of Turkey, Syria, Iraq, and Iran, announced in May 2025 that it would dissolve itself and “end its armed struggle.”[36] The Kurdistan Free Life Party (PJAK), which is the Iranian branch of the PKK, announced in May that it would not adhere to the PKK’s decision to dissolve.[37] PJAK seeks to establish an “autonomous Kurdish region within a federal political structure in Iran” and has previously targeted Iranian security forces.[38]&nbsp; Iran has previously accused Kurdish opposition groups of inciting protests in western Iran and cooperating with Israel to facilitate attacks in Iran.[39]</p>    <p><strong>Possible Jaish al Adl fighters attempted to kill a Shahouzehi tribal leader, Mohammad Shahouzehi, in Khash, Sistan and Baluchistan Province, on October 31.[40]</strong> A human rights organization that monitors developments in Sistan and Baluchistan Province reported that Shahouzehi played a significant role in the regime’s crackdown on protesters in Zahedan, Sistan and Baluchistan Province, in 2022.[41] Possible Jaish al Adl fighters recently killed a prominent Sunni tribal leader close to the Iranian regime in Iranshahr, Sistan and Baluchistan Province, on October 19.[42]&nbsp; Jaish al Adl is a Baloch, Salafi-jihadi militant group that frequently attacks Iranian security forces in southeastern Iran.</p> </div>    <div class="gb-element-c62ff6e9" title="Iraq" data-id="iraq"> <h2 class="gb-text">Iraq</h2>    <p><strong>Popular Mobilization Committee Chairman Faleh al Fayyadh separated a primarily Christian regiment from the Asaib Ahl al Haq-affiliated 50th Population Mobilization Forces (PMF) Brigade, possibly in an attempt to increase goodwill among the Christian population in the Ninewa Plains ahead of the November 2025 Iraqi parliamentary elections.</strong>[43] The PMF is an Iraqi state security service primarily comprised of Iranian-backed Iraqi militias, many of which report to Iran instead of the Iraqi Prime Minister.[44] Fayyadh separated the primarily Christian 13th Regiment from the 50th PMF Brigade on October 19 and restored the Ninewa Plains Protection Units as an independent force.[45] The PMF forced the 13th Regiment to join the 50th Brigade in 2023.[46] The 13th Regiment and the 74th Regiment had previously fought the Islamic State in the Ninewa Plains area under the banner of the Ninewa Plains Protection Units.[47] The 50th PMF Brigade mostly consists of Shias from southern Iraq and is associated with its former commander, Rayan al Kaldani, who is sanctioned by the United States for human rights abuses.[48] The separation of the 13th Regiment from the 50th Brigade reportedly follows the 13th Regiment’s refusal to help the 50th Brigade secure seats in the upcoming elections.[49] Kaldani has historically used the 50th Brigade to support candidates from the 50th Brigade’s Babylon Movement in past elections.[50] The Babylon Movement controls four out of five quota seats reserved for Christians in the Iraqi Parliament.[51] The Ninewa Plains local population has urged the Iraqi federal government to reverse the 13th Regiment’s integration into the 50th PMF Brigade in recent years.[52] The 13th Regiment’s reported unwillingness to aid the Babylon Movement’s electoral prospects in an area in which the 50th Brigade is already unpopular may have motivated Fayyadh to sever the link between the two forces to secure<strong> </strong>more Christian votes in the elections.</p> </div>    <div class="gb-element-f7908aa5" data-id="syria" title="Syria"> <h2 class="gb-text">Syria</h2>    <p><strong>The Syrian Justice Ministry will soon hold public trials for individuals who committed atrocities on the Syrian coast in March 2025. These trials will test the Syrian government’s ability and willingness to implement transitional justice and restore minority trust.</strong> Syrian Justice Minister Mazhar al Wais told Emirati media on October 29 that the Justice Ministry will soon put individuals who committed atrocities during the Syrian coastal massacres in March 2025 on public trial.[53] Wais invited the media to monitor the trials to ensure that there is no impunity for the perpetrators.[54] The Syrian National Inquiry Commission, which was created to investigate the coastal violence, previously announced that it had referred 298 individuals to the Syrian judiciary for their attacks on Alawites in March.[55] The Syrian transitional government has arrested some Ministry of Defense fighters accused of atrocities but has not publicized these arrests.[56] The trials will test the government’s judicial independence and procedural transparency. Prosecuting perpetrators of sectarian violence would help the transitional government restore trust among minority communities, particularly Alawites, by showing that the state is willing to prosecute members of its own institutions alongside Assadist insurgents.</p> </div>    <div class="gb-element-3cc09576" title="Arabian Peninsula" data-id="arabian-peninsula"> <h2 class="gb-text">Arabian Peninsula</h2>    <p><strong>Iran likely attempted to supply the Houthis with chemical materials and military equipment to support the Houthis’ domestic drone and missile production. </strong>The Yemeni National Resistance Forces (NRF) intercepted a shipment of chemical materials and military equipment on a small vessel in the Bab el Mandeb Strait that was en route to the Houthi-controlled Hudaydah Port on October 9.[57] The NRF reported that the vessel originated from the Port of Djibouti, but it suspected that the shipment was from Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.[58] The shipment reportedly included chemicals that absorb electromagnetic waves and reduce drone radar signatures.[59] Iran has previously supplied military equipment and chemical materials to the Houthis via smugglers at the Port of Dijbouti to bolster the Houthis’ domestic drone and missile production capabilities.[60]</p> </div>    <div class="gb-element-98a95600" data-id="palestinian-territories-lebanon" title="Palestinian Territories &amp;

A source reportedly affiliated with Ukrainian military intelligence stated on October 29 that Russian forces are infiltrating Pokrovsk in groups of five to 10 people and that Pokrovsk is mainly a contested &#8220;gray zone.&#8221;[3] The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) claimed that elements of the 2nd Combined Arms Army (CAA, Central Military District [CMD]) are advancing within Pokrovsk, including near the Pokrovsk railway station in central Pokrovsk, and that elements of the 5th Motorized Rifle Brigade (51st CAA, formerly known as the 1st Donetsk People&#8217;s Republic Army Corps [DNR AC], Southern Military District [SMD]) are advancing in Myrnohrad.[4] Russian milbloggers also claimed that Russian forces are advancing further in Pokrovsk and into eastern Myrnohrad and near Rodynske.[5] Another Russian milblogger claimed that elements of the 41st CAA (CMD) advanced west of Pokrovsk toward Hryshyne and advanced to the M-30 Pokrovsk-Pavlohrad highway.[6] The porous nature of the frontline and pervasiveness of drones in this area continues to complicate and obscure the tactical picture in Pokrovsk, and ISW will provide an updated assessment as the situation becomes clearer.</p>    <p></p>   <div class="conflict-map-block"><a href="https://understandingwar.org/map/assessed-control-of-terrain-in-the-pokrovsk-direction-october-31-2025-at-130-pm-et/" title="Assessed Control of Terrain in the Pokrovsk Direction, October 31, 2025 at 1:30 PM ET" class="map-link" target=""><a href="https://understandingwar.org/map/assessed-control-of-terrain-in-the-pokrovsk-direction-october-31-2025-at-130-pm-et/"><style>  	.fancybox__container {      	z-index: 10002 !important;

ISW continues to assess that providing US Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine would parallel Russia&#8217;s regular use of long-range cruise and ballistic missiles against Ukraine and reduce this important Russian advantage.[8] Russia regularly uses missiles comparable to the Tomahawk, such as Kh-series and Kalibr cruise, Kinzhal aeroballistic, and Iskander ballistic and cruise missiles that Russia uses in its nightly strikes against Ukraine.[9] Russia has used most of these missile types since 2022 and began using Iskander-K cruise missiles in 2023. The Tomahawk missiles’ long-range and larger payload would enable the Ukrainian military to inflict substantial damage on key Russian military assets located deep within Russian territory, such as the Shahed drone factory in Yelabuga, Republic of Tatarstan, and the Engels-2 Air Base in Saratov Oblast, from which Russia sorties the strategic bombers that fire air-launched cruise missiles at Ukraine.</p>    <p></p>    <p><strong>Russia and Belarus continue to threaten Europe with the future deployment of Oreshnik missiles to Belarus. </strong>Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko stated on October 31 that Russia will deploy the Oreshnik missile system on combat duty to Belarus in December 2025.[10] Kremlin officials have claimed as recently as October 29 that Russia and Belarus do not feel &#8220;safe&#8221; given European “Russophobic statements” and supposed militaristic aspirations and hysteria.[11] ISW continues to assess that Russia is using the Oreshnik as part of a reflexive control campaign and ongoing nuclear saber rattling aimed at undermining Western resolve to militarily support Ukraine.[12] Lukashenko and Russian President Vladimir Putin announced plans in December 2024 to deploy the Oreshnik missile systems to Belarus in 2025.[13]</p>    <p></p>    <p><strong>Ukraine continues to conduct long-range drone and missile strikes against Russian air defense and energy infrastructure. </strong>The Ukrainian Navy reported, and geolocated footage indicates, that Ukrainian forces conducted a Neptune missile strike against the Oryol Thermal Power Plant in Oryol Oblast and the Novobryansk substation in Bryansk Oblast overnight on October 30 to 31.[14] The Ukrainian Navy reported that both facilities supply power to Russian military enterprises in Oryol Oblast. Ukraine’s Unmanned Systems Forces (USF) reported on October 31 that USF elements, in cooperation with the Russian Chernaya Iskra insurgency group, disabled a Russian Buk-M3 surface-to-air missile (SAM) system and NEBO-U early warning radar system in Rostov Oblast on the night of September 27 to 28.[15]</p>    <p></p>    <p><strong>Russian forces have repeatedly struck Ukraine with nuclear-capable 9M729 Novator ground-launched cruise missiles since August 2025, in apparent violation of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty. </strong>Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha told <em>Reuters</em> on October 31 that Russian forces recently began using nuclear-capable 9M729 Novator ground-launched cruise missiles against Ukraine, the first public acknowledgement that Russian forces have employed these missiles against Ukraine.[16] Sybiha noted that the missile’s range violates the INF Treaty, which bans ground-launched missiles with a range between 500 and 5,500 kilometers. Russian Oreshnik missiles also notably violate the INF Treaty.[17] A military source told <em>Reuters</em> that Russian forces launched a 9M729 missile against an unspecified target in Ukraine at a range of over 1,200 kilometers on October 5. A senior Ukrainian official told <em>Reuters</em> that Russian forces launched Novator missiles against Ukraine twice in 2022 and 23 times since August 2025. Russia’s use of the missile comes against the backdrop of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s announcements of Russian nuclear weapons tests of the Burevestnik missile and Poseidon unmanned underwater vehicle.[18]</p>    <p></p>    <p><strong>A German court convicted several citizens of conspiring to commit acts of sabotage in Germany on behalf of Russia, and Lithuanian authorities closed the Vilnius Airport due to more aerial incursions from Belarusian airspace. </strong>German outlet <em>Deutsche Welle</em> (DW) reported on October 30 that a German court convicted a dual German-Russian citizen and two other German citizens of espionage and conspiring to commit acts of sabotage in Germany on behalf of Russia.[19] DW noted that the dual German citizen admitted to fighting in a pro-Russian militia in eastern Ukraine in 2014. Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda announced on October 31 that authorities closed the Vilnius Airport after observing an unspecified number of balloons flying toward the airport from Belarusian airspace.[20] This incident marks the most recent instance of balloon disruptions near the Vilnius Airport in October 2025.[21] Lithuania recently extended its closure of land border crossings with Belarus in response to the incidents.[22] ISW assesses that the aerial incursions into Belarus are very likely linked to Russia&#8217;s ongoing Phase Zero informational and psychological conditions-setting phase — to gauge NATO&#8217;s responsiveness and gather actionable intelligence in preparation for a possible NATO-Russia war in the future.[23]</p>    <p></p>   <div class="conflict-map-block"><a href="https://understandingwar.org/map/russian-phase-zero-operations-in-europe-october-31-2025/" title="Russian Phase Zero Operations in Europe, October 31, 2025" class="map-link" target=""><a href="https://understandingwar.org/map/russian-phase-zero-operations-in-europe-october-31-2025/"><img decoding="async" src="https://understandingwar.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Russian-Phase-Zero-Operations-in-Europe-October-31-2025.webp" class="zoomable-image" alt="Map Thumbnail" style="max-width:100%;" height="auto" width="100%" data-large="" data-type="image"></a></a></div><div class="conflict-map-title" data-map-title="Russian Phase Zero Operations in Europe, October 31, 2025"></div><div class="conflict-map-id" data-map-id="110454"></div>   <p></p>    <p><strong>Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov recently appointed former First Deputy Trade and Industry Minister Vasily Osmakov as Deputy Minister of Defense. </strong>Belousov announced Osmakov’s appointment on October 31 at the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) Council of Defense Ministers in Kazakhstan.[24] Russian state outlet RBK reported on October 31 that Osmakov became an official in the Ministry of Industry and Trade in 2004 and first deputy minister in 2021.[25] Sources told RBK that the Russian MoD is appointing Osmakov to replace Russian Deputy Defense Minister Alexander Fomin due to Fomin’s supposed retirement.

                 <div class="gb-element-f40f39d3" data-id="toplines" title="Toplines"> <h2 class="gb-text">Toplines</h2>    <p><strong>The PRC’s agreement to temporarily suspend export controls on rare earth elements is likely a short-term de-escalation measure amid its long-term strategic intent to inhibit US technological development.</strong> US President Donald Trump and CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping met in Busan, South Korea, at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit on October 30 and finalized the terms of a trade truce.[1]  A PRC Ministry of Commerce spokesperson confirmed in a press statement on October 30 that the PRC will place a one-year suspension on the rare earth element export controls that it enacted on October 9.[2] The pair also agreed to a range of de-escalatory trade measures covering PRC purchases of US soybeans, the mutual suspension of port-service fees, and the postponement of reciprocal tariffs.[3]</p>    <p></p>    <p>Rare earth elements are needed to produce everything from consumer electronics to auto manufacturing, semiconductors, and defense technology. US access to these elements is critical to national and economic security. The PRC holds approximately 70% of the market share in rare earth element mining and accounts for 70% of US rare earth imports as of 2024.[4]&nbsp; The PRC framed these export controls as a necessary measure to protect its national security interests and regulate dual-use goods. Rare earths are dual-use because of their applications for military and defense technology.[5]</p>    <p></p>    <p>The PRC is signaling that it is still committed to tight control over strategic resources tied to technological development, despite the temporary suspension in some export controls. The CCP has emphasized technological self-reliance and the development of “high-quality productive forces” as a national priority amid the current technological revolution.[6] The CCP’s proposed five-year plan for economic and social development from 2026 to 2030 highlighted maintaining the PRC’s control of strategic mineral resources as core to national security.[7]</p>    <p></p>    <p>Rare earth elements are one of these strategic mineral resources. The temporary suspension of export controls represents a tactical shift but does not indicate that the PRC has stopped pursuing its economic strategy. The suspension of export controls excludes previous restrictions on rare earth elements and critical mineral exports. The PRC’s reluctance to loosen restrictions on a broader basis indicates its permanent intention to restrict US access to rare earths and critical minerals to stifle its rival’s technological progress.</p>    <p></p>    <p>The CCP views dominance in emerging technologies as central to achieving its grand strategic objectives, including economic and military development in pursuit of great power status.[8] ISW assessed in July 2025 that the PRC would increasingly exploit its leverage over US demand for critical minerals and rare earth elements as technology becomes more important in US-PRC competition.[9]</p>    <p></p>    <p><strong>Trump and Xi did not finalize a TikTok deal during their meeting. </strong>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated on October 26, after US-PRC trade talks in Malaysia, that the two countries “reached a final deal on TikTok” and it could be approved during the Trump-Xi meeting on October 30.[10] The&nbsp; PRC Commerce Ministry spokesperson stated that the PRC agreed “to work with the United States to properly resolve issues related to TikTok,” but offered no further details.[11] The PRC still needs to approve the proposed TikTok deal that would form a new joint venture corporation to oversee the US operations of TikTok. The United States had national security concerns due to the CCP’s influence over TikTok, including mining American users’ data and shaping public opinion through promoting certain content.</p>    <p></p>    <p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, PRC Vice Premier He Lifeng, and PRC trade negotiator Li Chenggang laid the groundwork for the Xi-Trump meeting during negotiations from October 24 to 26 in Malaysia. Bessent stated that the talks resulted in “a very successful framework for the leaders to discuss.”[12]&nbsp; The extent to which the leaders discussed TikTok and Taiwan is unknown, based on available information.[13]</p>    <p></p>    <p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio laid similar groundwork in the days preceding Xi and Trump’s meeting. Rubio told reporters on October 25 that the United States would not abandon Taiwan in exchange for a favorable trade deal and spoke with PRC Foreign Minister Wang Yi in an October 27 call.[14]</p>    <p></p>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="729" height="693" src="https://understandingwar.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Trade-war-truce-terms-October-31-2025.webp" alt="Trade war truce terms October 31, 2025" class="wp-image-110425" srcset="https://understandingwar.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Trade-war-truce-terms-October-31-2025.webp 729w, https://understandingwar.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Trade-war-truce-terms-October-31-2025-300x285.webp 300w" sizes="(max-width: 729px) 100vw, 729px" /></figure>    <p></p>    <p><strong>PRC police announced a criminal investigation into Taiwanese legislator Puma Shen for “Taiwan Independence separatism.” PRC prosecution of such a high-profile Taiwanese political figure for “separatism” likely indicates an intensification of PRC lawfare efforts to discourage Taiwanese opposition to PRC annexation efforts. </strong>The Chongqing Municipal Public Security Bureau (PSB) announced that it was investigating Shen for establishing a “Taiwan Independence separatist organization” and “separatist crimes” on October 28.[15] Shen is a Taiwanese Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislator and the co-founder of Kuma Academy, a civil defense NGO that organizes training courses on topics including disaster response, first aid, and self-defense for Taiwanese citizens.[16] The PRC’s Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) has repeatedly sanctioned Shen and his family members and named him on lists of “Taiwan Independence diehards” published in 2024 and 2025.[17] The TAO also sanctioned Shen’s father’s export company in June 2025, citing Shen’s “separatism” as the explicit reason for the sanctions.[18] TAO spokesperson Chen Binhua praised the Chongqing PSB’s investigation into Shen as a “just and necessary move to oppose Taiwan Independence separatism” on October 28.[19]</p>    <p></p>    <p>The PRC claims sovereignty over Taiwan and regularly accuses Taiwanese political leaders and opponents of PRC annexation of Taiwan of “separatism” (alternatively translated as “secessionism” or “splittism”), which is a criminal offense in the PRC.[20] The PRC published a set of judicial guidelines for prosecuting “Taiwan Independence diehards for crimes of separatism and inciting separatism” in June 2024. These guidelines specify recommended sentences for convicted “separatists,” including life imprisonment or the death penalty for “separatist ringleaders” and other “serious” cases.[21] The guidelines also allow PRC courts to try accused “separatists” in absentia.[22]</p>    <p></p>    <p>The PRC has convicted and imprisoned two Taiwanese people for “separatism” since the release of the guidelines. A PRC court sentenced Yang Chih-yuan, a Taiwanese citizen and minor political activist, to 9 years in prison for “separatism” in September 2024.[23] The PRC also sentenced publisher and longtime Taiwan resident Li Yanhe to three years in prison for “inciting separatism” in March.[24] PRC police secretly arrested both Yang and Li and held them incommunicado under the PRC’s “Residential Surveillance at a Designated Location” (RSDL) system before formally announcing their arrests months later.[25] United Nations experts and Special Rapporteurs have identified RSDL as a form of enforced disappearance that violates international human rights law.[26] The PRC Ministry for State Security (MSS) also issued a public “bounty” for information aiding the capture of several Taiwanese military officers that the PRC accused of conducting “separatist” psychological warfare online on October 10.[27]</p>    <p></p>    <p>Puma Shen is the most prominent Taiwanese figure who the PRC has publicly investigated for “separatism.” The PRC is likely attempting to intimidate Taiwanese political and civil society leaders into softening their public opposition to PRC efforts to annex Taiwan by threatening severe legal penalties for “separatism,” including the death penalty. The PRC likely also aims to bolster its claims of sovereignty over Taiwan and to erode the legitimacy of Taiwan’s government by prosecuting an active legislator for alleged “separatism.”<br><br></p>    <p><strong>Taiwan plans to integrate unmanned systems warfare into its armed forces’ structure. The planned restructuring is likely inspired by Ukraine’s creation of an “unmanned systems forces” to improve the frontline use of unmanned systems. </strong>Taiwanese Defense Minister Wellington Koo stated before the Legislative Yuan’s (LY) Foreign Affairs and National Defense Committee on October 23 that the Ministry of National Defense (MND) plans to train and equip a separate unmanned systems brigade for each of Taiwan’s five combat zones.[28] Koo also announced that the 66th Marine Brigade will replace its armored and artillery regiments with specialized drone units.[29] Koo stated that the army’s restructuring efforts followed the principle of “technology replacing manpower and firepower replacing traditional forces” while aiming to create<strong> </strong>“lean organization[s], clear division of responsibilities, reasonable command hierarch[ies], and improved efficiency.”[30] Koo further noted that each combat zone will receive unmanned systems tailored to the tactical needs of each area.[31]</p>    <p></p>    <p>The formation of separate brigades for unmanned systems warfare suggests that the Taiwanese military is learning from the war in Ukraine and integrating drones into its national defense plans and force structure. Both Russia and Ukraine have integrated informal unmanned systems units since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 and have since established a separate “Unmanned Systems Forces” as separate services.[32] Creating separate unmanned systems formations within the formal force structure allows the units to scale and mass drone capabilities, including providing better coverage over larger operational areas and planning more sophisticated strike missions — including at deeper ranges — than individual drone units attached to infantry.[33]</p>    <p></p>    <p>The developments of separate drone formations can help a military organization like the Taiwanese military institutionalize approaches to drone warfare, scale drone production, and learn quickly from lessons in Ukraine. Both Russia and Ukraine frequently develop drone countermeasures that render enemy drones ineffective, only for the other side to adopt drone innovations that make those countermeasures obsolete.[34] The integration of drone units into regular military structures allows for centralization of materiel procurement and training processes, and formal integration of new technological innovations.[35] Formal drone units may serve as a conduit between Taiwan’s military and its defense industrial base to enhance the latter’s adaptability to rapid changes on the battlefield.[36]</p>    <p></p>    <p>Unmanned systems have come to define the war in Ukraine, and it is probable that they will play a key role in Taiwan’s defense.[37] Formal drone units are only one part of this equation, as infantry and armor also require smaller supporting regiments, companies, or platoons dedicated to the use of unmanned systems to be effective.[38]<br></p>    <p><strong>PRC state media site </strong><strong><em>Xinhua</em></strong><strong> published two commentaries on October 26 and 27 on the benefits of unification that suggested “Patriots Governing Hong Kong” would provide a model for Taiwan’s integration into the PRC. This model is more constrictive of Taiwan’s autonomy than the “one country, two systems” framework. </strong><em>Xinhua</em> debuted the new pseudonym “Zhong Taiwan” (钟台文) for both commentaries.[39] The articles reiterated language from the resolution designating October 25 as Taiwan Restoration Day, describing unification as a historical inevitability and Taiwan as an inalienable part of China.[40] The October 27 article made an economic case for unification, stating that Taiwan would join a “cross-strait common market” that allowed it to reap the benefits of the mainland’s economic progress.[41] The commentary further noted that, after unification, “Taiwan independence forces” would no longer use Taiwan’s budget for national defense, allowing for greater spending on the people.[42]</p>    <p></p>    <p>The October 27 article also outlined the political parameters for unification, stating that “Patriots governing Taiwan with a high degree of autonomy will be implemented.”[43] This is the first time an authoritative source has used this phrase regarding Taiwan.[44] The phrase “Patriots governing Hong Kong” gained prominence following the 2019–2020 protests against PRC administration of the region.[45] Hong Kong’s Legislative Council passed an electoral reform bill in May 2021 that expanded the legislature from 70 to 90 seats while cutting the number of directly elected seats from 35 to 20, transferring substantial authority to a 1,500-member Election Committee that could vet candidates for their allegiance to the PRC. [46] This effectively prevented pro-democracy opposition politicians from running for office in Hong Kong under the guise of ensuring the city was governed solely by “patriots.”[47]</p>    <p></p>    <p>The mention of “Patriots governing Taiwan” represents a shift away from the “one country, two systems” model in which Taiwan would purportedly retain some level of democratic self-governance. The PRC has typically touted the “one country, two systems” model as accounting for differences in political and economic realities between the PRC and Hong Kong.[48] The PRC Ministry of Foreign Affairs officially claims that the “one country, two systems” principle will inform unification between Taiwan and the mainland.[49] The October 27 <em>Xinhua</em> commentary suggests, however, that the PRC aims to pursue a more aggressive unification policy that would see Taiwan forfeit its autonomy immediately upon integration with the PRC.</p> </div>   <div class="gb-container gb-container-6d9519ed" data-id="key-takeaways" title="Key Takeaways"> <div class="gb-container gb-container-9851fc54 form-wrapper-mobile">  <h2 class="gb-headline gb-headline-249caf6f gb-headline-text">Key Takeaways</h2>    <ol class="wp-block-list"> <li class="has-main-white-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-ee78d4f88eaf97c48aaa9fe518469e2a"><strong>Trump-Xi meeting: </strong>The PRC’s agreement to temporarily suspend export controls on rare earth elements is likely a short-term de-escalation measure amid its long-term strategic intent to inhibit US technological development.</li>    <li class="has-main-white-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-629c41bcc4bc0905a663b3a747d7b47e"><strong>Trump-Xi meeting: </strong>Trump and Xi did not finalize a TikTok deal during their meeting.</li>    <li class="has-main-white-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-a5e3edc26642b6bcc2c9de2c6ab0b379"><strong>PRC lawfare:</strong> PRC police announced a criminal investigation into Taiwanese legislator Puma Shen for “Taiwan Independence separatism.” PRC prosecution of such a high-profile Taiwanese political figure for “separatism” likely indicates an intensification of PRC lawfare efforts to discourage Taiwanese opposition to PRC annexation efforts.</li>    <li class="has-main-white-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-9ab150323837ce249e7755f07878b4bb"><strong>Taiwanese military modernization: </strong>Taiwan plans to integrate unmanned systems warfare into its armed forces’ structure.

The Taiwanese High Court also sentenced Kao’s girlfriend to six years and ten months in prison for facilitating communication between Kao’s cell and the PRC.[51] The Taiwan High Court ruled that Kao was politically motivated, while the four people whom he recruited were financially motivated. The High Court sentenced his four recruits to lesser sentences due to their financial motives, with sentences ranging from two and a half to six years.[52] </p>    <p></p>    <p>PRC Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) Spokesperson Chen Binhua claimed that the DPP sentenced Kao for political reasons. [53]&nbsp; High Court judges are approved by the Personnel Review Committee of the Judicial Yuan as opposed to being direct political appointees, so Chen’s statement is incorrect.</p>    <p></p>    <p><strong>The PRC designated October 25 as “Taiwan Restoration Day” as part of an effort to undermine the historical basis of Taiwan’s sovereignty and reshape Chinese history to support the PRC’s assertion that Taiwan is an inseparable part of China. </strong>The standing committee of the PRC’s National People’s Congress approved a resolution on October 24 that designated October 25 as the holiday.[54] The decision commemorates the return of Taiwan to Chinese sovereignty in 1945 following its 50-year Japanese occupation.[55] The PRC resolution described the restoration as “an important link in the chain of historical facts and legal principles that establishes Taiwan as a part of China.”[56] PRC state media outlet Xinhua released a commentary on October 24 that outlined the PRC’s historical argument for the “irreversible unity” between China and Taiwan.[57] The commentary cited the 1943 Cairo Declaration, the 1945 Potsdam Declaration, the 1945 restoration of Taiwan to “Chinese sovereignty” and the 1971 UN Resolution 2758 that declared the PRC as the representative of China at the UN to argue that the PRC, the inheritor of sovereignty over China, also has legitimate sovereignty over Taiwan.[58] The commentary further stated that efforts by the “DDP authorities” to realize the “de-Sinicization” of Taiwan contradict these historical events.[59]</p>    <p></p>    <p>The CCP held a commemorative event on October 25 for restoration day. Minister of the CCP’s United Front Work Department Li Ganjie and member of the Politburo Standing Committee Wang Huning led the event. Taiwanese media reported that Wang made a specific case to Taiwan regarding the benefits of unification, stating that it would improve Taiwan’s economic development, energy and resource security, infrastructure development, security, and foreign relations.[60] Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council responded to Wang’s speech, stating that cross-strait relations are a product of “systemic differences” between authoritarianism and democracy.[61]</p>    <p></p>    <p>Taiwan’s Kuomintang (KMT) and the Taiwan People’s Party (TPP) led efforts to establish October 25 as a national holiday for Taiwan’s retrocession in May 2025.[62] Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Secretary-General Hsu Kuo-yung faced criticism from the KMT and TPP for stating that there was no such thing as a “Taiwan retrocession day” on September 9, 2025.[63] PRC media outlet Global Times referenced Hsu’s remarks in an October 23 article discussing the October 25 holiday, stating that historical facts refute the “DPP authorities[‘]” efforts to reshape Chinese history.[64] Former Taiwanese President and KMT politician Ma Ying-jeou similarly criticized the DPP on October 25 for failing to recognize the holiday, suggesting this indicated the DPP’s “pro-Japan” sympathies.[65] The KMT does not acknowledge that Taiwan Restoration Day grants the PRC sovereignty over Taiwan, however.[66]</p>    <p></p>    <p>The establishment of the October 25 holiday, followed by a concentrated media campaign to advance the PRC’s historical narrative, is part of broader PRC efforts to revise the historical record in a manner favorable to its claims to sovereignty over Taiwan. The PRC has never controlled Taiwan in its history, nor has the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).[67] The PRC attempts to obfuscate this fact by conflating Chinese sovereignty in 1945, before the existence of the PRC, with its position as the sole representative of China in the United Nations. It also aims to take advantage of an existing fracture in Taiwanese politics regarding the status of Taiwan Restoration Day. These efforts are intended to frame unification as a historical imperative while undermining the basis for Taiwan’s de facto sovereignty.<br></p>    <p><strong>Taiwan’s Coast Guard Administration (CGA) announced a special budget exceeding NTD $29.5 billion (approximately USD $900 million).</strong><strong><em>[68]</em></strong><strong> The proposal represents a major step in modernizing Taiwan’s maritime defense capabilities amid intensifying PRC gray-zone activities. </strong>The CGA announced the details of its budget proposal on October 25, but the budget is part of a larger special budget proposal to strengthen Taiwan’s resilience that the Executive Yuan approved in September. The special budget is currently under review by the Legislative Yuan. The CGA’s budget initiative focuses on expanding the CGA fleet, improving surveillance and communications infrastructure—including AI-assisted command systems and infrared imaging sensors—and enhancing interagency coordination to safeguard maritime sovereignty.</p>    <p></p>    <p>The budget stipulates that the Ocean Affairs Council (OAC), the CGA’s parent agency, will construct 40 new coast guard vessels as part of a nine-year modernization program, including 12 ships of 2,000 tons, 14 of 300 tons, and 14 of 100 tons, all featuring all-steel hulls for improved speed, endurance, and collision resistance. Vessels of these sizes are relatively small; the Taiwanese Navy’s <em>Cheng Kung</em>-class frigates have a displacement of 4,100 tons, and DARPA’s USX-1 Defiant unmanned vessel is 180ft long and 240 tons.[69] [70]The OAC said the new vessels will replace aging patrol craft and strengthen Taiwan’s capacity to respond to incursions by PRC coast guard, maritime militia, and research ships. The special budget also allocates NTD $10.3 billion to upgrade cybersecurity and communications, NTD $6.8 billion for unmanned vehicle systems, and NTD $8.7 billion for coastal defense reinforcement. The Agriculture Ministry will subsidize the installation of Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) on approximately 5,000 small fishing vessels, ensuring comprehensive fleet tracking and enhanced identification of foreign intrusions into Taiwan’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).[71]</p>    <p></p>    <p>The CGA’s modernization initiative aligns with broader Taiwanese efforts to respond to PRC incursions. These incursions aim to degrade Taiwanese threat awareness and attenuate military resources. The China Coast Guard (CCG) vessels have reportedly carried out regular incursions into Taiwan-administered waters around the Kinmen Islands since February 2024 and began similar incursions around Taiwan’s Pratas (Dongsha) Islands in February 2025. The CCG ships frequently disable AIS transponders to conceal movements and test Taiwan’s law enforcement response. The CGA has also reported small-scale infiltration by PRC nationals using inflatable boats or swimming, which it said could be a low-cost effort to exploit radar blind spots and test Taiwan’s coastal defense readiness.[72] The CGA has responded with heightened enforcement and deterrence measures. Since January, the CGA has implemented twin-ship escort operations and conducted 159 intercepts of Chinese fishing vessels, detaining 12 small craft engaged in illegal operations.[73] The CGA has also coordinated revisions to submarine cable laws—mandating AIS integrity, banning illegal anchoring, and increasing penalties for violations following PRC-linked sabotage incidents. The CGA also upgraded equipment, shipborne surveillance systems, and enforcement protocols to counter escalating gray-zone tactics since February 2024.[74]</p>    <p></p>    <p><strong>Azerbaijan excluded Taiwan from an annual conference, possibly under pressure from the PRC. The PRC has long sought to limit Taiwan’s diplomatic efforts with other states and bar Taiwan from participating in international organizations. </strong>The International Association of Judges (IAJ) expressed support for Taiwan after Azerbaijan blocked Taiwanese delegates’ attendance from an annual conference. The head of the Taiwanese delegation, High Court Judge Lin Yi-lun, traveled to Azerbaijan but was denied entry. Five other judges canceled their trips because they never received entry permits.[75] The Taiwanese Judges Association of the Republic of China (JAROC) reportedly stated that the IAJ regrets Taiwan’s exclusion.[76] IAJ stated it would ensure future conference locations permit all judges’ attendance to prevent further exclusion.[77]</p>    <p></p>    <p>JAROC did not specifically accuse the PRC of undue influence, but Taiwan’s exclusion resembles previous PRC efforts to block Taiwan from participation in multilateral groups.[78] The PRC systemically pushes for Taiwan’s exclusion from international organizations, including the United Nations, Pacific Islands Forum, and other multilateral bodies.[79] This aligns with its strategy to delegitimize and isolate Taiwan from its allies, partners, and other states.</p>    <p></p>    <p>IAJ’s statement exemplifies efforts to counteract Taiwan’s exclusion from multilateral organizations. The PRC will likely continue to push for Taiwan’s exclusion from international bodies as a means of eroding Taiwan’s network of international support.</p>    <p></p>    <h3 class="gb-text gb-text-7d429230">China</h3>    <p><strong>The<em> PLA Daily</em> published an editorial likely intended to warn PLA personnel against challenging the Communist Party’s control of the military and, by extension, Party Secretary Xi Jinping’s martial authority. The editorial suggests that the expulsion of nine seniormost generals from the CCP on October 17 stemmed from worries about political and ideological loyalty in the PLA. </strong>The editorial, titled “Firmly Defend the Political Character of the People’s Army,” stated that the October 17 purge preserved the political nature and purpose of the PLA.[80] The editorial also emphasized in multiple places that the PLA is the armed wing of the Communist Party rather than the state. The editorial stated that history indicated the necessity of “revolutionary political forging” and “ideological and political training” in the military. The editorial added that the party’s anti-corruption effort is linked to the Party’s “absolute leadership” over the army and is a “major political struggle.” The editorial stressed the centrality of General Secretary Xi Jinping to the Party and, by extension, the military. The editorial finally urged senior cadres to use corrupt officials as “negative examples” to ensure their own proper conduct.</p>    <p></p>    <p>Four of the nine generals purged on October 17 (Miao Hua, He Hongjun, Qiu Shutong, and Yuan Huazhi) were political commissars. Political commissars enforce political discipline and party loyalty in the PLA.[81] A <em>PLA Daily</em> editorial on October 18 accused He Weidong, Miao Hua, and He Hongjun of undermining the CMC Chairman Responsibility System that provides Xi Jinping with absolute authority over the military.[82] The PRC increased its oversight of military publications in February 2025 after several military-affiliated organizations published articles in support of collective leadership and intra-party democracy, which are ideas that contradict the Chairman Responsibility System and Xi’s centralization of power since 2012.[83] The stress that the editorial placed on ideological formation and the centrality of Xi Jinping to the Communist Party suggest that the decision to expel several top generals from the military stemmed from a concern for the PLA’s ideological loyalty to Xi. The October 24 editorial’s discussion of the purges likewise indicates that they were intended to deter military personnel from mounting any further ideological challenges to the absolute authority of Xi Jinping and the Party’s control over the military.</p> </div>    <div class="gb-element-84398d66" title="Northeast Asia" data-id="ne-asia"> <h2 class="gb-text">Northeast Asia</h2>    <p></p>    <h3 class="gb-text gb-text-e55e93f8">Japan</h3>    <p><strong>The PRC objected to Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s plan to accelerate Japan’s defense buildup. </strong>Takaichi pledged to raise defense spending to 2% of Japan’s GDP by March 2026 during her first major policy address to the National Diet on October 25.[84] Her statement marks a major acceleration in Japan’s 2% defense spending goal, which was originally set for Japanese fiscal year 2027 (ending on March 31, 2028).[85] Takaichi expressed support for military expansion and cited concerns about the military activities of the PRC, DPRK, and Russia. She also<strong> </strong>declared that her government would revise Japan’s 2022 National Security Strategy by the end of 2026, which is notable because<strong> </strong>Japan usually revises its strategy approximately once every ten years.[86] Takaichi added that the PRC is an important neighbor but expressed concerns related to economic security.[87] Takaichi also plans to loosen defense export restrictions and provide more government support to Japan’s defense industry.[88]</p>    <p></p>    <p>Japan-PRC relations are not likely to improve under the Takaichi administration. PRC Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) spokesperson Guo Jiakun criticized Takaichi’s speech and reiterated the PRC’s opposition to Japan’s increasing defense budget and arms exports.[89] Xi Jinping has not yet sent a customary congratulatory message to Takaichi since she was sworn in, despite having congratulated Yoshihide Suga, Fumio Kishida, and Shigeru Ishiba when they became prime minister.[90] Guo claimed that the PRC has already made “appropriate arrangements” in accordance with diplomatic practices, however.[91] Guo also declined to comment on whether Xi will meet with Takaichi on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.[92]</p>    <p></p>    <p><strong>Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi and US President Donald Trump pledged to elevate the US-Japan alliance into a “new golden age” on October 28.[93] </strong>Takaichi and Trump also signed an agreement on critical minerals and rare earths to secure supplies and increase investment in mining and processing during Trump’s visit to Japan as the second stop of his Asia trip.[94]&nbsp; Takaichi spoke to Trump by phone before the in-person meeting and reiterated that the US-Japan alliance is her top foreign and security policy priority. Takaichi added that Japan is an “indispensable partner” for the US’ strategy on the PRC and the Indo-Pacific.[95] Trump praised Takaichi and described the US as Japan’s strongest ally.[96]</p>    <p></p>    <p>The PRC interprets the US-Japan alliance as a “cold war relic” and will likely perceive Takaichi and Trump’s increased commitment to the alliance as an attempt to undermine the PRC’s regional interests and influence.[97] PRC MFA spokesperson Guo Jiakun urged the US and Japan to be “conducive to regional peace and stability” as they upgrade their bilateral relations and security cooperation.[98]</p>    <h3 class="gb-text gb-text-3874d63a">North Korea</h3>    <p><strong>North Korea fired several short-range ballistic missiles (SRBM) from Pyongyang toward a target in North Korea on October 22, marking the first missile launch since South Korean President Lee Jae Myung took office in June.[99] </strong>South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) called the launch a “provocation” and added<strong> </strong>that an unspecified number of missiles flew “around 350 km” (217 miles).[100] North Korean state media Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) claimed on October 23 that its Missile Administration “successfully” tested a “new weapon system,” adding that “two hypersonic projectiles” launched from Ryokpho District in Pyongyang hit the target point on Kwesang Peak in Orang County, North Hamgyoung Province.[101] KCNA photos showed the missiles striking a circular target, reportedly demonstrating “precision” strike capabilities. Seoul-based news outlet <em>NK News</em> stated the weapon is likely to be either the “new Hwasong-11E SRBM equipped with a hypersonic glide vehicle” or “a variant of the Hwasong-11C SRBM.”[102]</p>    <p></p>    <p>North Korea’s first missile test-launch under the Lee administration came a week before the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in South Korea, attended by US President Donald Trump and his expected summit with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung. North Korea has previously fired missiles during high-level US officials’ visit to South Korea, such as when North Korea launched two SRBMs the day before former Vice President Kamala Harris’ trip to the demilitarized zone in 2022.[103] North Korea’s missile launches ahead of or during a high-level exchange between the United States and South Korea could aim to protest close United States-South Korea cooperation, which it views as a security threat. North Korea could be testing SRBM capabilities to advance its goals of fielding more “effective tactical nuclear weapons” targeting South Korea and the United States. North Korea is enhancing SRBM accuracy by fielding them on the Russian frontlines against Ukraine. Ukrainian military sources reported that the accuracy of North Korean SRBMs improved from 1 to 3 kilometers in 2023 to within 50 to 100 meters by 2025, attributing the advancement to Russian assistance.[104]</p>    <p></p>    <p>North Korea’s missile launch underscores policy divergence with the Lee administration. Lee has focused on de-escalation measures on the Korean Peninsula, emphasizing the new administration’s shift from former President Yoon Suk-yeol’s “hardline” approach against North Korean provocation.[105] The Ministry of Unification under Lee has sought to reduce the scale of military exercises near the demilitarized zone, remove propaganda loudspeakers, and propose peaceful coexistence as the unification goal.[106] North Korea is focused on enhancing its strike capabilities against South Korea rather than engaging in peace talks, however. Workers’ Party of Korea (WPK) General Secretary Kim Jong Un likely views normalized inter-Korean relations as disruptive to his nuclear weapons development objectives and unhelpful to efforts aimed at securing sanctions relief.</p>    <p></p>    <p><strong>North Korea has intensified criticism of the United States and showcased strong ties with Russia days ahead of Trump’s visit to South Korea and rejected Trump’s calls for dialogue for denuclearization</strong>.<strong> </strong>North Korea has intensified anti-United States rhetoric as Trump called for dialogue with Kim during his upcoming trip to South Korea.[107] North Korea has simultaneously showcased its ties with Russia ahead of Trump’s visit to South Korea. North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Sun Hui also visited Russia and blamed the United States and its allies for “heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula” in a joint statement with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.[108] Choe also met with Putin and discussed North Korea-Russia relations. Kim has meanwhile refused to respond to Trump’s calls for dialogue with North Korea.</p>    <p></p>    <p>Pyongyang is unlikely to engage in talks unless it believes Washington has abandoned its denuclearization goals — a condition Kim set for dialogue during his September 21 speech at the Supreme People’s Assembly.[109] North Korea claims its nuclear development as a matter of sovereignty and national security. North Korea has highlighted Russia’s implied support for its nuclear program, such as when the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on October 28 that it supported North Korean “measures” to “safeguard the country’s sovereignty.” North Korea may seek alternative ways to gain international recognition as a nuclear state, cement its nuclear status as non-negotiable, and weaken Washington’s longstanding commitment to certifiable, irreplaceable, and verifiable denuclearization goals. North Korea may also be reluctant to risk compromising ties with Russia by renewing diplomacy with the United States. Russia is receiving arms and troop support from North Korea for its war in Ukraine, and US efforts to resume talks with North Korea may hinder such cooperation. North Korea and Russia’s joint condemnation of the United States as a destabilizing force, along with Choe’s participation in the security forum in Minsk, indicates their continued alignment — making diplomacy between Washington and Pyongyang unlikely.[110]</p>    <h3 class="gb-text gb-text-6e293447">South Korea</h3>    <p><strong>The South Korean Chief of Naval Operation Admiral Kang Dong-gil said that the PRC is establishing illegal structures in territorial waters in the Yellow Sea, which is probably part of an effort to illegally extend the PRC’s territorial waters in the Yellow Sea.[111] </strong>The PRC recently deployed a rubber boat, oxygen tanks, and personnel to one of its structures.[112]<strong> </strong>Kang stated that the PRC “is not complying with international law” regarding its illegal installation of structures within the Yellow Sea Provisional Measures Zone (PMZ) at the National Defense Committee audit on October 23. The PMZ is an area where the PRC and South Korean exclusive economic zones overlap. South Korea and the PRC agreed to designate the overlapping area as a PMZ in 2000 to regulate activities other than fishing. He further warned about the possibility of the PRC utilizing the structures as a foundation for territorial claims. Kang noted that South Korea lacks the naval bandwidth to respond to increasing PRC naval activities in the Yellow Sea over the last two decades.[113] The number of PRC naval activities in the area increased from 110 times in 2017 to 360 times in 2023 and 330 times in 2024.[114] The PRC has already dispatched its naval vessels into the South Korean jurisdictional sea area 260 times in 2025.[115] South Korean Democratic Party legislator Yi Byeong-jin released a photograph<strong> </strong>on October 22 showing personnel and equipment aboard one of the PRC structures, <em>Shenlan 2,</em> in August. The photograph identified five individuals alongside an oxygen tank, a diving suit, and a rubber boat.[116] Yi suggested that the PRC’s activities may be part of broader efforts to claim large areas of the Yellow Sea as PRC territorial waters like the PRC has already done in the South China Sea with its Nine-Dash Line. Yi noted that diving suits are not typically used in maritime fishing to support his assessment.[117]   </p>    <p></p>    <p>The PRC has installed three structures that it claims are for fishing purposes within the PMZ. The PRC Coast Guard has twice blocked a South Korean research ship from approaching the structures in 2025, once in February and again in September.[118] The two sides established a joint committee to discuss the PMZ issue in April 2025. South Korea has deployed monitoring buoys in the PMZ, presumably to monitor illegal PRC activity.</p>    <p></p>    <p>The illegal PRC structures and growing presence of PRC naval forces in the Yellow Sea signal Beijing’s continued will to expand its influence into the territorial waters and EEZs of other countries in contravention of established international law. The PRC continues to claim that it supports international law and UN decisions, but these moves clearly demonstrate that the PRC disregards international laws that do not support PRC objectives. The PRC has moved to expand its activities despite diplomatic engagement between the two sides. The PRC may extend its territorial waters further into the Korean Peninsula and Japan by claiming the structure as an inhabited reef, which the PRC has already done to impose its Nine-Dash Line in the South China Sea.[119] Beijing’s efforts to limit and gain PRC control over parts of the South Korean EEZ demonstrate that Beijing’s efforts to build better relations with South Korea are not based on goodwill or respect for South Korea’s international rights.[120] </p>    <p></p>   <div class="conflict-map-block"><a href="https://understandingwar.org/map/timeline-of-prc-maritime-activity-within-the-pmz-in-the-yellow-sea-as-of-october-2025/" title="Timeline of PRC maritime activity within the PMZ in the Yellow Sea as of October 2025" class="map-link" target=""><a href="https://understandingwar.org/map/timeline-of-prc-maritime-activity-within-the-pmz-in-the-yellow-sea-as-of-october-2025/"><style>  	.fancybox__container {      	z-index: 10002 !important; /* Choose a value that ensures it appears above other elements */  	}  	/* Image container styles */  	.image-container {  		position: relative;  		display: inline-block;  		overflow: hidden;  	}    	.zoomable-image {  		max-width: 100%;  		cursor: pointer;  		transition: transform 0.3s ease;  	}    	/* Add zoom icon on hover using a pseudo-element */  	.zoomable-image::after {  		content: '🔍';  		position: absolute;  		top: 8px;  		right: 8px;  		background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6);  		color: white;  		font-size: 18px;  		padding: 5px;  		border-radius: 50%;  		opacity: 0;  		transition: opacity 0.3s ease;  		pointer-events: none;  	}    	.image-container:hover .zoomable-image::after {  		opacity: 1;  	}    	/* Modal styles */  	.modal {  		display: none;  		position: fixed;  		z-index: 10002;  		left: 0;  		top: 0;  		width: 100%;  		height: 100%;  		overflow: auto;  		background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);  		align-items: center;  		justify-content: center;  		display: flex;  	}    	.modal-content {  		max-width: 90%;  		max-height: 90%;  		display: flex;  		align-items: center;  		justify-content: center;  	}    	.modal-content img {  		max-width: 100%;  		max-height: 100%;  		transition: transform 0.3s ease;  	}    	.close {  		position: absolute;  		top: 20px;  		right: 30px;  		font-size: 40px;  		color: white;  		cursor: pointer;  	}    	.zoom-controls {  		position: absolute;  		bottom: 20px;  		right: 30px;  		display: flex;  		gap: 10px;  	}    	.zoom-controls button {  		font-size: 24px;  		background-color: #ffffff;  		border: none;  		padding: 8px;  		border-radius: 4px;  		cursor: pointer;  		transition: background-color 0.2s ease;  	}    	.zoom-controls button:hover {  		background-color: #e0e0e0;  	}    </style>  <img decoding="async" src="https://understandingwar.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Timeline-of-PRC-maritime-activity-within-the-PMZ-in-the-Yellow-Sea-October-29-2025-scaled.webp" class="zoomable-image" alt="Map Thumbnail" style="max-width:100%;" height="auto" width="100%" data-large="" data-type="image"></a></a></div><div class="conflict-map-title" data-map-title="Timeline of PRC maritime activity within the PMZ in the Yellow Sea as of October 2025"></div><div class="conflict-map-id" data-map-id="110429"></div>   <p></p> </div>    <div class="gb-element-e4f6f064" data-id="europe" title="Europe"> <h2 class="gb-text">Europe</h2>    <p><em>A version of this text appeared in the October 23 Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment.[121]</em></p>    <p></p>    <p><strong>The People’s Republic of China (PRC) and Indian oil companies are reportedly significantly reducing direct purchases of Russian oil in the short term, and the European Union (EU) passed its 19th sanctions package against Russia, primarily targeting the Russian energy sector.</strong> Reuters reported on October 23, citing multiple trade sources, that major PRC state oil companies — including PetroChina, SinoPec, CNOOC, and Zhenhua Oil — suspended purchases of seaborne Russian oil “at least in the short term” following the October 22 US sanctions against Russian state oil company Rosneft and the private Russian oil company Lukoil.[122] Trade sources told Reuters that Rosneft and Lukoil sell most oil to the PRC indirectly by going through intermediaries, but that PRC refiners are more likely to pause buying to assess the impact of sanctions. The trade sources stated that independent PRC refiners would still likely seek to purchase Russian oil despite the sanctions. <em>Bloomberg</em> and Reuters reported on October 23 citing refineries and industry sources that Indian oil refineries will significantly cut Russian oil imports due to the US sanctions.[123] An industry source told Reuters that India’s cut of Russian oil imports will be “massive” but not total or immediate as Indian refineries will still import some barrels of Russian crude oil through intermediaries.[124]</p>    <p></p>    <p>The EU sanctions package bans Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports into the EU beginning in January 2027 for long-term contracts and within six months (by April 23, 2026) for short-term contracts.[125] The package also targets tankers assessed to be part of the Russian shadow fleet, a United Arab Emirates (UAE) entity that serves as a conduit for the Russian shadow fleet by circumventing EU sanctions, and four PRC oil refineries. The EU also sanctioned Russian financial institutions and operators from the UAE and the PRC that supply military and dual-use goods to Russia. The EU imposed additional travel restrictions and authorization requirements for Russian diplomats and sanctioned 11 individuals involved in the illegal deportation, abduction, and militarized education of Ukrainian children.</p> </div>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="1013" height="122" src="https://understandingwar.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Babel20Street20email20logo_0_169.jpg" alt="Powered by Babel Street logo" class="wp-image-72815" srcset="https://understandingwar.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Babel20Street20email20logo_0_169.jpg 1013w, https://understandingwar.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Babel20Street20email20logo_0_169-300x36.jpg 300w, https://understandingwar.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Babel20Street20email20logo_0_169-768x92.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1013px) 100vw, 1013px" /></figure>   <div class="gb-container gb-container-0bae4d62" data-id="endnotes" title="Endnotes"> <div class="gb-container gb-container-50b4151c gb-accordion"> <div class="gb-container gb-container-1702e1b2 gb-accordion__item" data-transition="slide">  <button class="gb-button gb-button-74216f8f gb-accordion__toggle endnote-accordion-btn" id="gb-accordion-toggle-74216f8f"><span class="gb-button-text">Endnotes</span><span class="gb-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 448 512" width="1em" height="1em" aria-hidden="true" role="img" class="gb-accordion__icon"><path d="M207.029 381.476L12.686 187.132c-9.373-9.373-9.373-24.569 0-33.941l22.667-22.667c9.357-9.357 24.522-9.375 33.901-.04L224 284.505l154.745-154.021c9.379-9.335 24.544-9.317 33.901.04l22.667 22.667c9.373 9.373 9.373 24.569 0 33.941L240.971 381.476c-9.373 9.372-24.569 9.372-33.942 0z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 448 512" width="1em" height="1em" aria-hidden="true" role="img" class="gb-accordion__icon-open"><path d="M240.971 130.524l194.343 194.343c9.373 9.373 9.373 24.569 0 33.941l-22.667 22.667c-9.357 9.357-24.522 9.375-33.901.04L224 227.495 69.255 381.516c-9.379 9.335-24.544 9.317-33.901-.04l-22.667-22.667c-9.373-9.373-9.373-24.569 0-33.941L207.03 130.525c9.372-9.373 24.568-9.373 33.941-.001z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg></span></button>   <div id="gb-accordion-content-7bda4188" class="gb-accordion__content"><div class="gb-container gb-container-7bda4188 endnote-accordion-content">  <p>[1] https://www.mfa dot gov.cn/zyxw/202510/t20251030_11743847.shtml<br>[2] http://www.news dot cn/world/20251030/dd3984dcc50b4c13bab9d2849da6e1b3/c.html<br>[3] https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-30/bessent-says-china-to-buy-12-million-tons-of-soybeans-this-year<br>https://www.globaltimes dot cn/page/202510/1346945.shtml<br>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/us-halt-entity-restrictions-one-year-after-trump-xi-meeting-bessent-says-2025-10-30/<br>http://www.news dot cn/world/20251030/dd3984dcc50b4c13bab9d2849da6e1b3/c.html<br>[4] https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2025/mcs2025-rare-earths.pdf<br>[5] https://www.mofcom dot gov.cn/zwgk/zcfb/art/2025/art_6cb42957741440c6984de696b70df9ae.html<br>[6] https://www.gov dot cn/yaowen/liebiao/202510/content_7045444.htm<br>[7] https://www.gov dot cn/zhengce/202510/content_7046052.htm<br>[8] https://www.gov dot cn/yaowen/liebiao/202510/content_7045444.htm<br>[9] https://understandingwar.org/research/china-taiwan/china-taiwan-weekly-update-july-24-2025/<br>[10] https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/26/us/politics/trump-xi-tiktok-deal-bessent.html;<br>https://apnews.com/article/china-tiktok-trump-bytedance-jinping-f9d15903dd1b9bd92602838a79088710<br>[11] https://www.mofcom dot gov.cn/xwfb/xwfyrth/art/2025/art_c42035acf50846ffb9fb4761ee224faf.html<br>[12] https://www.reuters.com/world/china/ustr-greer-says-trade-talks-with-china-moving-toward-agreement-leaders-review-2025-10-26/<br>[13] https://www.npr.org/2025/10/30/nx-s1-5590754/trump-china-xi-meeting-lowers-tariffs<br>[14] https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/10/secretary-rubios-call-with-chinas-director-of-the-office-of-the-ccp-central-foreign-affairs-commission-and-foreign-minister-wang-yi-2;

The Associated Press assessed on September 24 that Iran does not have the necessary planetary mixers to produce solid missile fuel due to Israeli strikes on Iranian military sites in October 2024 and June 2025, however.[2] Iran has reportedly received larger quantities of sodium perchlorate in recent shipments compared to the quantities of sodium perchlorate that Iran previously received from China in February and May 2025.[3] These shipments notably arrived in Iran on September 29, two days after the UN Security Council reimposed sanctions on Iran that included sanctions related to the Iranian missile program.[4] China has recently assisted Iran in developing its ballistic missile program through shipments of sodium perchlorate in addition to other dual-use technologies.[5] Iran reportedly received about 1000 tons of sodium perchlorate from China in February and May 2025.[6] The larger recent shipments to Iran come as Iran tries to rebuild its missile program following the Israel-Iran War in June 2025. Former Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) Commander Mohammad Ali Jafari argued on October 25 that Iran’s missile program is its main form of deterrence and that Iran deliberately prioritized developing its missile and drone capabilities over its air and ground forces to counter the superior capabilities of the United States and Israel.[7]<br></p>   <div class="conflict-map-block"><a href="https://understandingwar.org/map/sanctioned-vessels-transporting-missile-fuel-precursor-from-china-to-iran-october-30-2025/" title="Sanctioned Vessels Transporting Missile Fuel Precursor from China to Iran, October 30, 2025" class="map-link" target=""><a href="https://understandingwar.org/map/sanctioned-vessels-transporting-missile-fuel-precursor-from-china-to-iran-october-30-2025/"><style>  	.fancybox__container {      	z-index: 10002 !important; /* Choose a value that ensures it appears above other elements */  	}  	/* Image container styles */  	.image-container {  		position: relative;  		display: inline-block;  		overflow: hidden;  	}    	.zoomable-image {  		max-width: 100%;  		cursor: pointer;  		transition: transform 0.3s ease;  	}    	/* Add zoom icon on hover using a pseudo-element */  	.zoomable-image::after {  		content: '🔍';  		position: absolute;  		top: 8px;  		right: 8px;  		background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6);  		color: white;  		font-size: 18px;  		padding: 5px;  		border-radius: 50%;  		opacity: 0;  		transition: opacity 0.3s ease;  		pointer-events: none;  	}    	.image-container:hover .zoomable-image::after {  		opacity: 1;  	}    	/* Modal styles */  	.modal {  		display: none;  		position: fixed;  		z-index: 10002;  		left: 0;  		top: 0;  		width: 100%;  		height: 100%;  		overflow: auto;  		background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);  		align-items: center;  		justify-content: center;  		display: flex;  	}    	.modal-content {  		max-width: 90%;  		max-height: 90%;  		display: flex;  		align-items: center;  		justify-content: center;  	}    	.modal-content img {  		max-width: 100%;  		max-height: 100%;  		transition: transform 0.3s ease;  	}    	.close {  		position: absolute;  		top: 20px;  		right: 30px;  		font-size: 40px;  		color: white;  		cursor: pointer;  	}    	.zoom-controls {  		position: absolute;  		bottom: 20px;  		right: 30px;  		display: flex;  		gap: 10px;  	}    	.zoom-controls button {  		font-size: 24px;  		background-color: #ffffff;  		border: none;  		padding: 8px;  		border-radius: 4px;  		cursor: pointer;  		transition: background-color 0.2s ease;  	}    	.zoom-controls button:hover {  		background-color: #e0e0e0;  	}    </style>  <img decoding="async" src="https://understandingwar.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/OCT-30-2025-Iranian-Vessels.webp" class="zoomable-image" alt="Map Thumbnail" style="max-width:100%;" height="auto" width="100%" data-large="" data-type="image"></a></a></div><div class="conflict-map-title" data-map-title="Sanctioned Vessels Transporting Missile Fuel Precursor from China to Iran, October 30, 2025"></div><div class="conflict-map-id" data-map-id="110359"></div>   <p></p>    <p><strong>Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammad Shia al Sudani may attempt to ally with Sunni and Kurdish political parties after the upcoming parliamentary elections in order to increase his own power by sidelining powerful Iranian-backed Shia factions and other prominent Shia parties.</strong> Iraqi media reported on October 30 that unspecified Iraqi political figures are working to form a Sudani-led post-election alliance that will include Sunni and Kurdish political figures and potentially exclude unspecified Iran-aligned figures and parties.[8] It is unclear which Iran-aligned political parties would be excluded from the alliance. Sudani’s Reconstruction and Development Coalition includes Popular Mobilization Commission (PMC) Chairman Faleh al Fayyadh and former Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) Spokesperson Ahmed al Asadi, which suggests that certain Iranian-backed and -influenced groups will remain in Sudani’s post-election alliance.[9] The PMF is an Iraqi state security service primarily comprised of Iranian-backed Iraqi militias, many of which report to Iran instead of the Iraqi prime minister.[10]</p>    <p>Sudani may be attempting to build a coalition with Sunni, Kurdish, and key Shia partners that can sideline these prominent Shia Coordination Framework leaders and ultimately form a government that Sudani leads. Sudani‘s reported efforts to sideline prominent Iranian-backed actors also comes after US Special Envoy to Iraq Mark Savaya reportedly met with leaders of political blocs in Baghdad.[11] The United States has repeatedly pressured the Iraqi government to limit Iranian influence within Iraqi government institutions and has voiced concerns about powerful Iran-aligned parties running in the upcoming parliamentary elections.[12]</p>    <p>Iranian-backed and –influenced parties in Iraq may be opposing Sudani’s participation in the upcoming elections out of fear that Sudani, a popular prime minister, could win a large amount of seats and bar them from government. Some Shia Coordination Framework parties&#8211;the most influential of which are backed by Iran or have long abetted Iran&#8217;s activities in Iraq&#8211;are opposed to Sudani’s participation in the upcoming elections.[13] Some unidentified Shia Coordination Framework parties have reportedly considered choosing one of the Shia Coordination Framework “sheikhs” as the next prime minister due to Sudani’s participation in the upcoming elections.[14] The term “sheikhs” in this context likely refers to the most prominent Shia Coordination Framework leaders, such as State of Law Coalition head and former Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki, Badr Organization head Hadi al Ameri, and Iranian-backed Iraqi militia Asaib Ahl al Haq head Qais al Khazali. These leaders collectively hold many seats in the current parliament, which makes them influential in the current Sudani government. Sudani, if he manages to prevent them from joining the new government by forming a ruling coalition without them, would be able to increase his own power at their expense.</p>    <p>Sudani’s reported strategy mirrors Shia National Movement leader Moqtada al Sadr’s ultimately unsuccessful attempt to ally with Sunni and Kurdish leaders to form a “national majority government” that excluded Iran-backed Iraqi parties after the November 2021 parliamentary elections.[15] Sadr attempted to exclude Iranian-backed Iraqi parties from the government formation process by allying with the Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP) and Sunni Sovereignty alliance after Sadr&#8217;s Sairoon bloc won 73 of the 329 parliamentary seats after the November 2021 elections.[16] Sadr’s efforts to sideline Iranian-backed Iraqi actors ultimately failed when these groups employed both political and violent tactics to hinder the government formation process.[17] Iranian-backed Iraqi militias conducted rocket attacks on Kurdish oil and gas fields between March and June 2022 to pressure Kurdish parties to withdraw their support for Sadr, for example.[18] The Iraqi Federal Supreme Court, which Iranian-backed Iraqi actors have coopted, also issued a ruling in February 2022 that made it impossible for Sadr to form a government without the inclusion of Iranian-backed Iraqi parties.[19] Sadr ultimately ordered his party to withdraw from Parliament, thus clearing the way for Iranian-backed Shia parties to form their own government without Sadr.</p>    <p></p>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="791" height="1024" src="https://understandingwar.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-10-30-OnePager-791x1024.webp" alt="2025-10-30 OnePager" class="wp-image-110360" srcset="https://understandingwar.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-10-30-OnePager-791x1024.webp 791w, https://understandingwar.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-10-30-OnePager-232x300.webp 232w, https://understandingwar.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-10-30-OnePager-768x994.webp 768w, https://understandingwar.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-10-30-OnePager.webp 816w" sizes="(max-width: 791px) 100vw, 791px" /></figure> </div>   <div class="gb-container gb-container-6d9519ed" data-id="key-takeaways" title="Key Takeaways"> <div class="gb-container gb-container-9851fc54 form-wrapper-mobile">  <h2 class="gb-headline gb-headline-249caf6f gb-headline-text">Key Takeaways</h2>    <ol class="wp-block-list"> <li class="has-main-white-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-36ce90b1b73201cc30a951eac70cbe29"> <strong>Chinese Support for the Iranian Missile Program: </strong>Iran has reportedly received increasingly large sodium perchlorate shipments from China amid Iranian efforts to rebuild its ballistic missile program in the wake of the Israel-Iran war.

US and Libyan officials told The Wall Street Journal in mid-December 2024 that Russia flew equipment, including air defense radars, from Hmeimim Airbase to Russian air bases in eastern Libya.[23] <em>Bloomberg </em>also reported that a Russian Antonov An-124 Ruslan heavy-lift cargo aircraft landed at Hmeimim Airbase three times between October 24 and October 29.[24] The Antonov An-124 Ruslan has a 150-ton cargo capacity that allows it to transport heavy military equipment and cargo on behalf of the Russian military.[25] CTP-ISW cannot confirm that the Russian military has redeployed any equipment to Hmeimim Airbase at the time of this writing. These flights resumed shortly after Syrian President Ahmed al Shara met with Russian President Vladimir Putin on October 15 in Moscow and declared that he sought to ”redefine” the Syria-Russia relationship.[26] It is not clear if Syrian and Russian officials have reached a concrete agreement on the future of Russian basing in Syria, despite a series of Syrian-Russian meetings in September and October 2025 to discuss military coordination.[27] Syrian Defense Minister Major General Marhaf Abu Qasra most recently met with Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov in Moscow on October 28 to discuss military topics.[28]</p>    <p><strong>The US-trained Syrian Free Army has left the Syrian army and joined the Syrian Ministry of Interior (MoI)’s Badia Security Directorate.</strong> The MoI integrated the Syrian Free Army (formerly known as Maghawir al Thawra) into the Badia Security Directorate and appointed a replacement commander for the unit on October 29.[29] The unit will presumably continue to operate in the Syrian Central Desert (also known as the Badia), which is a hotspot for ISIS activity. The Syrian Free Army had previously integrated into the Syrian Ministry of Defense (MoD) Rif Dimashq-based 70th division in May 2025.[30] The Syrian Free Army confirmed that it will continue to operate out of the US base in al Tanf and that the unit’s transfer to the MoI “does not affect [the Syrian Free Army’s] cooperation with International Coalition forces.”[31] US forces have trained and operated alongside Syrian Free Army forces against ISIS since 2015.[32] The unit has about 600 fighters.[33] International Coalition forces and the Syrian Free Army conducted a raid on a suspected ISIS leader in Dumayr, Rif Dimashq Province, on October 17.[34] The Syrian Free Army also conducted several counter-narcotic and counter-weapon smuggling operations before the fall of the Assad regime in December 2024.[35]</p> </div>    <div class="gb-element-3cc09576" title="Arabian Peninsula" data-id="arabian-peninsula"> <h2 class="gb-text">Arabian Peninsula</h2>    <p><em>Nothing significant to report.</em></p> </div>    <div class="gb-element-98a95600" data-id="palestinian-territories-lebanon" title="Palestinian Territories &amp; Lebanon"> <h2 class="gb-text">Palestinian Territories &amp; Lebanon</h2>    <p><strong>Israeli ground forces raided a building in southern Lebanon on October 29 as part of Israeli efforts to destroy Hezbollah infrastructure and prevent Hezbollah’s reconstitution.[36] </strong>The Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) claimed that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) advanced into the town of Blida in southern Lebanon and raided the town’s local municipality building.[37] The LAF reported that the IDF killed a municipal employee during the raid.[38] Blida is located along the Israel-Lebanon border, adjacent to the Israeli town of Yiftah.[39] The IDF said that Hezbollah had recently used the Blida building for unspecified “terrorist activities” and that the IDF fired upon a suspect in the building that forces deemed a direct threat.[40] LAF forces deployed to Blida after Israeli forces withdrew and have since established positions around the town.[41]</p>    <p><strong>Lebanese President Joseph Aoun requested that the LAF “confront” Israeli forces in response to the Israeli raid, probably to limit Hezbollah’s ability to justify its continued existence as a militia under the guise of resistance to Israel. </strong>Aoun requested that the LAF “confront any Israeli [ground] incursions” into “liberated” areas of southern Lebanon to defend Lebanese territory and its citizens during a meeting with LAF Commander Brigadier Rudolphe Haykal on October 30.[42] Aoun consistently issues statements that condemn Israeli operations in Lebanon but has not previously called upon Lebanese security services to take direct action against Israel in response to an Israeli operation.[43] It is doubtful that the LAF will act upon this request given that the LAF has historically not participated in any conflicts with Israel and has not directly confronted the IDF in recent months.[44]</p>    <p>Aoun’s request comes amid calls from Hezbollah and Hezbollah-aligned Lebanese officials upon the Lebanese government to take further action in response to the Israeli raid. Lebanese Parliament Speaker and Hezbollah ally Nabih Berri condemned the raid, stating that the raid constituted an aggression against Lebanon that ”cannot be reined in with condemnations.”[45] Hezbollah similarly condemned the raid and called on the Lebanese government to do more to halt Israeli operations in Lebanon.[46] Hezbollah has long framed itself as the ”defender” of Lebanon and used the Lebanese security forces’ historic inaction against Israel to justify its existence.[47] Hezbollah has recently employed this narrative and continued Israeli operations in Lebanon to reject the Lebanese government’s plan to disarm Hezbollah.[48] Aoun’s statements are almost certainly designed to push back against Hezbollah attempts to prevent its disarmament by the government by claiming that the LAF cannot resist Israel. Aoun and the Lebanese government are currently attempting to disarm Hezbollah but have made only very limited progress.</p> </div>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="1013" height="122" src="https://understandingwar.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Babel20Street20email20logo_0_169.jpg" alt="Powered by Babel Street logo" class="wp-image-72815" srcset="https://understandingwar.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Babel20Street20email20logo_0_169.jpg 1013w, https://understandingwar.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Babel20Street20email20logo_0_169-300x36.jpg 300w, https://understandingwar.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Babel20Street20email20logo_0_169-768x92.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1013px) 100vw, 1013px" /></figure>   <div class="gb-container gb-container-0bae4d62" data-id="endnotes" title="Endnotes"> <div class="gb-container gb-container-50b4151c gb-accordion"> <div class="gb-container gb-container-1702e1b2 gb-accordion__item" data-transition="slide">  <button class="gb-button gb-button-74216f8f gb-accordion__toggle endnote-accordion-btn" id="gb-accordion-toggle-74216f8f"><span class="gb-button-text">Endnotes</span><span class="gb-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 448 512" width="1em" height="1em" aria-hidden="true" role="img" class="gb-accordion__icon"><path d="M207.029 381.476L12.686 187.132c-9.373-9.373-9.373-24.569 0-33.941l22.667-22.667c9.357-9.357 24.522-9.375 33.901-.04L224 284.505l154.745-154.021c9.379-9.335 24.544-9.317 33.901.04l22.667 22.667c9.373 9.373 9.373 24.569 0 33.941L240.971 381.476c-9.373 9.372-24.569 9.372-33.942 0z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 448 512" width="1em" height="1em" aria-hidden="true" role="img" class="gb-accordion__icon-open"><path d="M240.971 130.524l194.343 194.343c9.373 9.373 9.373 24.569 0 33.941l-22.667 22.667c-9.357 9.357-24.522 9.375-33.901.04L224 227.495 69.255 381.516c-9.379 9.335-24.544 9.317-33.901-.04l-22.667-22.667c-9.373-9.373-9.373-24.569 0-33.941L207.03 130.525c9.372-9.373 24.568-9.373 33.941-.001z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg></span></button>   <div id="gb-accordion-content-7bda4188" class="gb-accordion__content"><div class="gb-container gb-container-7bda4188 endnote-accordion-content">  <p>[1] https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/29/middleeast/iran-rebuilding-ballistic-weapons-program-intl</p>    <p>[2] https://apnews.com/article/iran-missiles-planetary-mixers-israel-war-527bd871b691898b20eee98294dcda64</p>    <p>[3] https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/13/middleeast/iran-is-rearming-its-missile-program-and-a-ship-of-supplies-just-arrived-from-china-western-sources-say ;
