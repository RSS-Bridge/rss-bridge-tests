Same 8-inch display, MediaTek processor, and 13-hour battery life as our current pick. More RAM and a higher-resolution rear-facing camera sensor than its predecessor.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> Ad-supported lockscreen. Running multiple apps, content-heavy websites, or high-resolution games can cause lagging and freezing. Deal price is for the tablet with 32 GB storage, but if you need more, the 64 GB model is an extra $30.</p>

Best portion control for both large and small kibble sizes. Easy to program, owing to Petlibro’s Wi-Fi–enabled app. Stops most creatures from stealing extra food.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> The camera isn’t necessary for the feeder to work well, and it adds to the cost. More tech can also mean more issues. As with any camera-enabled device, there are potential risks. Deal on white.</p>

<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> Some find vibrating brushes to be uncomfortable or ticklish. If your child tends to brush roughly, the brush heads may need to be replaced more frequently. No case; protective cap is easy to lose.</p>

Clear, loud sound in a compact form. All the standard features of other Echo models at half the price. Bluetooth connection. Built-in Eero Wi-Fi can extend an Eero router&#039;s mesh network.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know: </strong>More expensive Echos offer better audio and call quality. Doesn&#039;t make video calls. We are still testing how well the Dot works with an Eero Wi-Fi system. Comes with four months of Amazon Music Unlimited, which auto-renews at the end of the trial period, so make sure to cancel before then.</p>

The best way to make clear ice on the cheap. Yields four 2-inch clear cubes. Uses directional freezing to create clear, bubble-free cubes that will keep drinks fizzier for longer. Good for cocktails.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> Cheaper than a countertop clear-ice maker. Takes 18-20 hours to fully freeze. Cubes can be broken down, but it&#039;s time-consuming and messy. Tray takes up a significant amount of freezer space.</p>

Great burr grinder with a burr set that&#039;s faster and more consistent than our top pick, and offers a wider range of coarser and finer grinds. Precise digital timer that allows you to grind <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl4bG5hmNMI" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a set amount of beans</a> so you don&#039;t have to measure each time you make coffee.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know: </strong>Finnicky dial can be a little annoying. Not significantly better than our top pick at grinding, just has some more features and incremental improvements. More suited for enthusiasts and hobbyists. Almost every part of the machine is repairable or replaceable. First time we&#039;ve posted a deal on this grinder and a nice $50 drop in price. Free shipping.</p>

Uniquely contoured handle gives great ergonomics and safety. Easy one-handed open and close. Easy to change blades, stores five additional blades in handle.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> Belt clip is not reversible. Smaller utility knife lacks blade storage. 50-pack of general purpose utility blades come in blade holder storage case designed for scoring.</p>

A third-person horde shooter where you and a team of up to four players take on swarms of giant bugs, killer robots, and your own team&#039;s reckless orbital bombardments. Tons of fun with progression that doesn&#039;t require investment into the microtransactions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know: </strong>While it is a &quot;cooperative&quot; multiplayer shooter, friendly fire is active and unable to be turned off, so it&#039;s worth keeping in mind when playing with friends (and troll-y strangers). Borrows liberally from the 1997 film <em>Starship Troopers,</em> which mixed sci-fi imagery with heavy social satire and commentary on war and the threat of fascism. Deal is for the physical disc for the PS5, and is down to the lowest price we&#039;ve seen so far.</p>

Dense proprietary memory foam has a pronounced, quicksand-like sink. Didn&#039;t overheat our testers. Cradles pressure points (like your shoulders and hips) well.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> Former pick. Our testers tended to either love or hate the sink of this topper. Weighs about 36 pounds, making it difficult to maneuver. Tempur-Pedic doesn’t allow returns, but has a 10-year warranty. Pricey, even on sale. Matches lows we saw earlier this year.</p>

Offers all the same basic features as our top pick, such as scheduling and in-app family sharing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> No water-flow meter. Can’t automatically skip scheduled runs based on whether rain is in the forecast, but you can toggle on a rain delay in the app to skip any watering cycles for a set amount of time. Matches previous lows, but street price has dropped over the past year.</p>

Brews smooth espresso, plus an 8-ounce cup of coffee that’s superior to anything we’ve tried from a Keurig. Short learning curve, with just one button and an automatic lid. Adjustable drip tray and water tank.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> Mugs are unstable on drip tray. We didn’t <em>love</em> the coffee, but it was still a big step up from Keurig&#039;s. Only uses Vertuo pods, which cost more than Original pods. On sale in gray.</p>

Stretchy wrap made of a soft, lightweight rayon fabric that fans across the shoulders to distribute the baby’s weight. The most comfortable of any wrap we tried.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> The soft fabric easily snags. It isn’t our go-to choice for crowded public places. It&#039;s hard to transfer a sleeping baby without waking them. Breastfeeding with the baby inside is difficult. Deal price on black and natural stripe pattern only.</p>

<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> It&#039;s easy to slide off your window if it&#039;s a distraction. Great for cats. Delayed shipping.</p>

Its white branches, trunk, and glitter-dusted all-PVC needles give it a pretty, crystalline look with the lights off. And with the lights on, all those reflective surfaces make the tree glow from within like a snowy lantern.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> We tested this model in our office, and even our staffers who prefer live trees thought it was beautiful. Especially striking in a dark room, or in a corner that doesn’t get much natural light during the day. Deal is for the 7.5-foot size with clear lights. Use code <strong>CHEER50</strong>.</p>

Offers excellent build quality, a satisfying typing experience, and more customization features than any other keyboard we recommend. Has the ability to adjust the actuation force (pressure required) for keys, and supports rapid trigger actuation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> Expensive for a wired-only keyboard. While it has a lot of specialization and customization features, it&#039;s probably overkill for most people. Can be used with MacOS but Corsair doesn&#039;t sell Mac-specific keycaps or offer a Mac layout.</p>

<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> JPMA-certified. More labor-intensive to assemble. Material isn&#039;t as soft and movements aren&#039;t as smooth as our top pick.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> Still very large and pricey, but significantly cheaper than usual. 256 GB storage with 12 GB of RAM. Not the best price we&#039;ve ever seen, but pretty good given its price history</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> One of the heaviest throws we’ve tested. Plush side is made with polyester, which may shed microplastics in the laundry. 90 days for returns; one-year warranty against defects. Deal price for the throw size reflects in cart.</p>

An ultraluxe, multi-fuel oven that can be fueled by propane or wood. Switching between fuel sources to be incredibly easy. From top to bottom, designed to give you an elevated pizza-making experience. Can fit up to a 16-inch pizza. Has a built-in thermometer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> This oven is big (read: not at all portable) and expensive, and the wood-fire mode requires pricey, somewhat-fussy pre-cut hardwood. Also, you might pay even more for enticing extras, like a steam injector and a rope-sealed door.</p>

Also include more comprehensive reading materials to dive deeper into cultures. Most projects are unique keepsakes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> There is a lot of reading. Some kids will need parental support. The inaugural box sets a high bar and the others after that can feel lackluster. Deal pricing with code <strong>FANFAVE</strong> is for 6-month and 12-month subscriptions, and significantly lower than their Cyber Monday deal. Subscription auto-renews; cancel anytime.</p>

Hydrow&#039;s library has over 5,000 interactive classes and excellent programming. Uses electromagnetic resistance, making it quieter than our other picks. Higher weight capacity, smaller footprint, and nearly half the price of its Peloton counterpart.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> Requires $44/month subscription (same as Peloton) for full functionality and access to the suite of classes and programming. No form-correction feature, and can only stream its own content (no Netflix or other entertainment). Changing resistance is a bit cumbersome through menus. Hydrow&#039;s virtual coaches were more engaging to our testers than Peloton&#039;s. Select store pickup at Best Buy to avoid oversize shipping fees (which add a $30 delivery fee).</p>

Featuring characters from the popular Pete the Cat series, this game challenges players to sing, act, or perform so they can collect cupcakes for Pete’s birthday party. Everyone “wins” (there’s no way to lose), and the game ends with the group singing “Happy Birthday” to Pete.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> You don’t have to be familiar with Pete and his friends to understand or enjoy this cooperative board game. In our experience, the challenges are varied enough to keep the players engaged.</p>

Easily machine washable (it&#039;ll become softer when you do).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know</strong>: Sewn-through construction prevents the down from shifting. In the past, we&#039;ve seen deals on this comforter in the &quot;Muted Clay&quot; color for nearly $80 less, so this deal price is disappointing to us. Use code <strong>DGW26B </strong>at checkout.

A 1080p IPS display that  delivers a consistent 360 Hz refresh rate if your computer is fast enough to keep up. Has a bunch of features similar to those we like on our main pick, including a USB hub, nice contrast, and a sturdy stand.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> Many professional esports players prefer 24-inch, 1080p monitors because the lower resolution compared with 1440p and 4K means less of a load on your GPU and, in return, more frames per second.</p>

Clear, powerful sound of a decent, small 5.1 surround-sound speaker system, at a price much less than that of our upgrade pick. Good clarity and natural tonal balance, although because its surround speakers don’t have upward-firing drivers, the surround effects aren’t as immersive.</p>

Portable touchscreen desktop is great for families or kids. Has onboard battery that allows it to be operated while not plugged in. Includes wireless keyboard and mouse.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know</strong>: The setup we recommend has an Intel Core i5-1335U processor and 16 GB of RAM, increasing the base price from $630 to $790 (+$160). Ports are a bit cramped. We recommend opting for at least 256 GB of storage. Make sure to select the Intel i5-1335U with 16 GB of RAM (the final option under &#039;Processor, Graphics, and Memory&#039;) to get the deal price.</p>

Wide and adjustable handlebar. Easy to assemble. Relatively light.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> Lacks a quick-release seat post, brakes, and a footrest for gliding. Recent increase in street price means this isn&#039;t the lowest sale price we&#039;ve seen, but it&#039;s unlikely the street price will drop. REI membership required. Select store pickup to avoid $30 oversize shipping fee.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> The 60% design that leaves out dedicated arrow keys, media keys, and a function row. Still retains the important things that most people need for gaming. Best price for the black color with tactile switches.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> Don’t have much bass. Can sound harsh when you crank up the volume. If you want to create more of a party atmosphere, you’ll be better off with one of our larger picks. Set of two speakers. Clip the on-page coupon.</p>

Portable, durable, easy-to-use, and packed with plenty of power. A wide array of outlets and charging ports make it convenient to use, no matter what devices you need to run. Pure sine-wave inverter makes it safe to use with most electronics, including critical devices like a CPAP machine.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know: </strong>Five-year warranty and reliable customer service during our tests. 851 W max output measured during our tests. Includes four AC outlets, one USB-C port, and two USB-A ports. Not waterproof, nor as powerful or long-lasting as some competitors. Down to a new low.</p>

Has three layers of foam and 968 individually wrapped, 8-inch coils.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> We think the materials suggest longevity. 15-year warranty. If you don’t like it, to return it for a full refund, you have to try this mattress for at least 30 days—but no more than 100 days. Use code <strong>SLEEPOPOLIS27</strong>.</p>

Lightest (just 20 pounds) and least expensive of our picks. A breeze to fold and unfold. Pleasant to drive. Relatively comfortable rounded foam handlebar.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know: </strong>Bare-bones. Three wheels. handlebar does not adjust at all, which may matter if you&#039;re especially tall or especially short. Not great for napping; will need a Britax car seat to use with infants. Not the lowest price we&#039;ve seen, but a decent value.</p>

Easy to use, with one shutter button and a small toggle that switches between color, black and white, sepia, and video (up to 10 seconds when connected to a power source). Photos have a creamy, nostalgic feel, similar to that of an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/fujifilm-instax-mini-12-review/">Instax camera</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> Basically a camera board inside a strong cardboard case. No Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or screen. Shutter delay can be a little frustrating. Tons of case options. Arrives unassembled, but it&#039;s easy to put together. Comes with 32 GB SD memory card and rechargeable batteries.</p>

Easy to use, durable, affordable, accurate, and capable of doing its job without additional features that aren’t necessary for around-the-house work. Can stand out unsupported for nearly 8 feet.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know</strong>: Gives you the best value. Does not have a rubberized body like our upgrade pick the Stanley FatMax, and not suitable for a job site beatdown.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> Of all the tested models, it&#039;s the least streamlined. Lacks a few features (like language options) and is also a little fussier to program. Deal on matte black. Only returnable in-store at Home Depot.</p>

An ideal extra layer: not too cold, warm, or fussy. Generously cut. Soft 50/50 cotton and polyester blend fabric feels breathable and holds color and texture better than 100% cotton. Inexpensive (especially on sale).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> Comes in sizes small to 3XL. On sale in a bunch of colors. Deal price is a dollar more than previous lows, but still a good value.</p>

Its top two steps are considerably larger and support the entire foot for better balance and range of motion while working. Comes with a large project tray that clips into the top. Has a smaller footprint than a typical stepladder.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> 300-pound weight rating. Can get most people to a reaching height of about 10 feet. The top of the ladder is lower than on similar ladders, which is a slight inconvenience. We&#039;ve seen this for $5 less earlier this year, but this is still a good deal price.</p>

This three-speed fan’s twisty arms can easily be secured to the metal legs of a headrest. Can cool down passengers in the backseat before the AC kicks in. Long-enough battery life to last overnight. Built-in LED light.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> Surprisingly powerful for something so small. Also mentioned in our guide to packing for summer camp. Recurring deal price, but rarely drops lower.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> 3 pounds heavier than the 3Dlife top pick and doesn’t come with a carry strap. Less expensive with this deal, and may be a better choice for you than our top pick if you don&#039;t imagine you&#039;ll need to carry the stroller often.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong>  Weighs a hefty 38 pounds when rear-facing. Easy to install in the forward-facing position, but rear-facing installation is a bit tricky. Fabric isn&#039;t machine-washable. Street price has risen since we last posted in 2022. On sale in railroad white pattern.</p>

Performed just as well as its costlier competitors. Kept ice frozen for over 24 hours. Stoped leaks with its screw-top lid. Available in over 20 colors and patterns.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> Most are dishwasher-safe, though some patterned options are hand-wash-only to preserve their design. Deal price on several colors from Amazon. Walmart is only available in green, pink, and purple leopard print, with store pickup to avoid shipping fees.</p>

The most convenient standing setup short of a full standing desk. Quicker and quieter than other electric standing desk converters we tested, and offers a lot of workspace.

<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> Significantly larger and heavier than other options, requiring 26 inches of desk depth (plus another 13 inches with the keyboard tray), and a weight of 92 pounds.

Synthetic fabrics can be more prone to harboring odors, but we haven&#039;t had any problems yet. Choose store pickup or add to a larger order to avoid shipping fees.</p>

<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> A bit heavy for a travel power strip. Lackluster surge protection only suited for short term use.</p>

Pass-through charging capabilities. Intuitive to use. Lighter than our picks, with super-slim shape.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> Rated capacity of 20,000 mAh is lower than most of our picks. Comes with a USB-C-to-C charging cable and cloth case, but no wall charger. One-year warranty is on the shorter side. Clip the on-page coupons.</p>

<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> About the same size as a cell phone in length and width and weighs less than a pound. Comes with a USB-A–to–Micro-USB charging cord but no charging cube. Leaving it in a car in extremely hot or cold conditions is not a great idea.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know: </strong>Highest pressure option is lower than that of our picks (80 psi versus 100 psi). Also offers only 60 seconds of flossing capacity (our picks offer 90 seconds). Only comes in green.</p>

Comes with a dialing attachment which lets you select 20 length options. All of those options cut well, and if you prefer a longer-pubic-hair style, this one impressed us. Held a 100-minute run time off a 60-minute charge.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> Not recommended if you want a skin-close trim because if you choose to forego the guard for a closer trim, the Manscaper tends to nick and cut skin. Comes with a limited five-year warranty.</p>

Electric dryer has a reversible door, interior light, and easy-to-clean lint tray. Sufficiently dries mixed loads on “normal” cycle.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> Solid brand reputation for reliability. Costco membership required. Deal includes delivery and installation, basic installation parts, old machine haul away, and a two-year warranty. Price reflects in cart. Click the &quot;build bundle&quot; button to customize and add to cart. If you want to stack these together, the stacking kit costs an additional $30.</p>

Along the sides, it has non-insulated stretch paneling, which adds mobility and makes the vest more breathable. Durable and highly water-repellent, and it contains synthetic insulation, which stays warm even when wet.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> Isn’t as warm as our Montbell vest pick, and it doesn’t keep the wind out quite as well, but many of our testers preferred the sleeker style. Side panels absorb water and dry more slowly than the rest of the vest.</p>

<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> Doesn&#039;t seem built to last for more than a couple of years, and we’ve heard about unrepairable breakdowns that happen sooner.

A well-engineered, smart, electronic bassinet that&#039;s outfitted with sensors. Can detects a baby’s needs and soothes them to sleep with automated rocking and white noise. When it works, it can be dreamy. Robust customer service.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> Incredibly expensive even on sale. 25-pound baby weight limit. There’s no guarantee your baby will actually find it comforting. Some had difficulty weaning their babies from the Snoo and moving them to a traditional crib after four to six months.</p>

The subwoofer—a cube measuring a little over 6 inches on each side—produces shockingly strong bass for its size and takes up little space under a desk. Built-in multicolor LED lighting.</p>

<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> Has some subtle control tweaks we don&#039;t like as much as those on our top pick, but works fine. Not the lowest price we&#039;ve seen but still a good deal. Delayed shipping.</p>

Compact, light, and able to record stabilized 4K video. Flip-out screen is great for easily framing selfies. Built-in optical image stabilization smooths movements. Designed explicitly for vlogging.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> Records 4K video at 30 fps or 1080p at 120 fps. Top-mounted directional mic records stereo audio. Stacked 1-inch sensor and f/1.8–4 Zeiss lens with 2.8x zoom. Menu and button layout aren&#039;t very intuitive. While we&#039;ve seen it at this price several times in the past year, it hasn&#039;t dropped lower.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know: </strong>Does not have a console, no tracking metrics. Accommodates riders with inseams between 28 inches and 38 inches. Adjustment process isn’t as elegant as on some of our other picks. The pedals have toe cages only. Maximum rider weight is 300 pounds.</p>

One coat gives a natural boost; extra coats intensify lashes without looking heavy or goopy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> Chunky brush can be unwieldy. Some testers noticed a touch of under-eye smudging after a full day of wear (but not full-on raccoon circles). Opt for store pickup to avoid shipping fees.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> Windows let in wind and rain in less temperate climates. Boxy and heavy to carry at 25 pounds, so best suited for car camping. Doors are comfortably wide enough for wheelchairs. Deal price of $143 includes shipping, and it&#039;s the lowest we&#039;ve seen.</p>

A relentlessly creative game, and it’s graphically stunning to boot. Full of cute references and homages to PlayStation’s 30-year history.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know: </strong>Deal is for a physical copy of the game for PS5.</p>

One of the simplest infant car seats to install when you’re using the base. It also has an added safety feature, an anti-rebound base. Can accommodate babies up to 32 inches or 35 pounds.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> At 10½ pounds, it&#039;s the heaviest of our picks. We found its no-base, seat-belt-only install tricky to pull off. Not as compatible with as many strollers from various brands as our other three picks. The DLX is only available in the Maison pattern.</p>

Excelled in our smoke tests. Highly efficient and very quiet on its lower, everyday fan settings. Four fan speeds offer a bit more flexibility. You can darken the display shutoff while the air purifier is still running.</p>

<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> The medium-high setting approaches our 50-decibel limit on acceptable noise. Our long-term test unit is performing without any issues, making us confident in its durability. Deal on white with clipped on-page coupon.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> Not as good as deal prices we&#039;ve seen in the past, but good deals have been harder to come by on PS5 controllers and we haven&#039;t posted a deal in over a year. Hit-or-miss compatibility with Windows and games outside of Steam. Available in most standard colors from Amazon and Walmart.</p>

<p><strong>Other things to know</strong>: The rest of the features and hardware are the same as the non-disk version. PlayStation had more top-rated exclusive titles than the Xbox. The PS5 is a huge console—yes, even the current, revised “slim” model—and it can’t fit well in a lot of media centers, vertically or horizontally.</p>

Slightly narrower and shorter than the OG. 1 TB storage (up from 825 GB).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> No disc drive, so you can’t watch Blu-rays or take advantage of used games, or old PS4 discs. Still some backwards compatibility issues with PS4 games and exclusives. No Dolby Vision or or DTS:X support. Despite being called the &quot;Slim,&quot; it&#039;s still quite bulky. Lowest price we&#039;ve seen.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> People of below-average height may have difficulty sitting properly. Less sturdy build than those of our more expensive picks. Street price has increased significantly since it first became a pick. Available in black from Amazon.</p>

Can capture clips up to one minute long and store them in the cloud for a week.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> Only streams in 720p resolution, but you can enable it to go to 1080p with the Bird Buddy Pro Subscription ($5 per month or $60 per year). Does not have night vision. Not as easy to fill as our top pick.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> Brightness and black-level performance isn&#039;t as good as our top pick&#039;s. As with most LCD TVs, not the best horizontal viewing angles. Looks better with 4K HDR video than it does with lower-resolution sources. We disliked the flimsy stand design.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know</strong>: A former top pick. The mist setting gives out a mild staticky hiss that can exacerbate tinnitus symptoms. The lack of a pause function and shampoo-rinsing spray make it slightly less useful overall than our top pick. This 2.5 gpm version in chrome is currently on sale for less than the 1.75 gpm pick in our guide.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know: </strong>This is an untested variant of the specific game we recommend, but the concept is the same all around. No game preparation required.</p>

<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> Customization process can get a little tedious and overwhelming. One-year Govee warranty isn&#039;t great for Christmas lights, but is fairly standard for smart-home products. Clip the on-page coupon.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> Also recommended in Wirecutter emergency preparedness guides. A cheaper power supply may risk damaging more sensitive electronics that need steady power. Street price has decreased in the past year. Recurring deal.</p>

<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> Two backup AAA batteries only maintain time and alarm settings during power outages.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> Only removed from our guide to the best pellet smoker grills because it lacks WiFi connectivity, but that may not be important to you. Has the first-generation Pro Series control panel with a temperature dial and a simple LED display. Doesn&#039;t come with a grill cover.</p>

<p><strong>Other things to know: </strong>Cellular connectivity is unnecessary for most people and requires a monthly data plan, but it&#039;s the first big drop in price we&#039;ve seen so far.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> Comes with fewer adjustments overall than the Gesture. Can purchase with height-adjustable or four-way adjustable armrests, as well as optional added lumbar support. Rubberized seat frame may annoy people who like to sit cross-legged.</p>

A workhorse mixer that&#039;s sturdy, relatively quiet, and easy to use. 10 speeds. 5-quart bowl is large enough for standard to large recipes and small enough for easy whipping of a ½ cup of cream or a single egg white.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> One of the fastest first speeds of all mixers we tested and no ½ speed. Comes with 5-quart stainless steel mixing bowl, flat beater, dough hook, and six-wire whip. Only available in black at Walmart. 1-year warranty at Walmart; 2-year Allstate warranty via eBay.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> Hood is less structured than other hoods we tested. No pockets. Not the most breathable hoodie we tested (fine for summer hikes in the Northeast, but we found it too warm for running on a 78-degree day). Available in women&#039;s XS-3X. Deal on blue.</p>

One of the best options you can buy, with more color volume, better viewing angles, superior audio performance, lower input lag, and more HDMI 2.1 inputs than other TVs we tested. Consistent performance across all sizes. An excellent choice for gamers who use multiple consoles. Sleek and lightweight yet solid build.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know</strong>: Doesn&#039;t support Dolby Vision HDR. Not as bright as our top pick, but brighter than our budget pick. Samsung’s Tizen Smart Hub is fine, but overdesigned. Comes with 1-year Samsung parts and labor limited warranty. Free shipping from Woot for Prime members.</p>

Smooth and sturdy ride. Immersive experience. Community emphasis. Engaging instructors. Bike+ features a larger touchscreen tablet that rotates 180 degrees left and right, an upgraded sound system, an improved front-facing camera with a privacy cover, and integrated Apple GymKit support.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> Even pricier than the Peloton Bike and add-ons aren’t crucial to getting a full experience. Requires a subscription ($44 a month) to function maximally. Limited warranty covers the tablet, mechanics, parts, and service from issues related to normal wear and tear for one year, and the bike frame for five years.</p>

Bamboo-blend fabric is delicate enough to be worn with dressier shoes like heels and loafers, though they still work with sneakers, too. Sold in inexpensive 5-packs that deliver bursts of color that hit the sweet spot between flashy and elegant.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know</strong>: Some users note durability and longevity issues; we haven&#039;t experienced any problems, but keep our expectations in line with the price. Sold in three sizes. Deal price is available on a handful of color combos.</p>

Keeps a 300 W load running for 22.5 minutes and a 20 W load running for 5 hours. Blocked all but 516.4 volts in our surge tests.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> Backed by five-year warranty, which is longer than most models tested. However, it lacks coaxial connectors, and is one of the priciest models we tested.</p>

<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> While we&#039;ve seen this deal price before, it rarely drops lower. Can still be a little too spooky for younger children at times. Free shipping for Prime members.</p>

Superior underfoot support while still offering a trail feel. Ultra-comfy and the most light weight of our picks. Customizable fit and best lacing system of any boot we’ve tried. Breathable with solid waterproofing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> Tend to run big, so we recommend ordering a half-size down from your street shoe size. Made with mostly recycled materials. On sale in multiple colors in most women&#039;s sizes. Not the lowest price we&#039;ve seen, but still a solid deal.</p>

<p><strong>Other things to know: </strong>Heavy—about 6 ounces, but lighter than most chef’s knives. Weight comes in handy when cutting thick-skinned fruits and vegetables. Sharp enough for delicate jobs. Like most knives we tested, struggles a bit to cut through the bottom crust of sourdough loaves.</p>

Had the best combination of image quality, white balance, subject tracking, and smooth background blur (in Zoom). For privacy, it automatically faces down and turns off when you close your video-conferencing software.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know:</strong> Twice the price of our top pick. Feels more fragile than other webcams we’ve tested, so we don’t recommend it for people who travel with their work gear.</p>

Quiet and compact. Great option for those who are short on storage space or plan to vacuum seal only occasionally.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other things to know: </strong>Not as powerful as our top pick. Requires more pressure to close than our other picks. Bundle includes roll of 10 sealer bags. We&#039;ve seen better deals for 50-bag bundles in the past, but this is a good value for what you get.</p>
