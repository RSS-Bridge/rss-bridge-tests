                <h2>Williams had been battling cancer since March of this year</h2><br><img src="https://www.djmag.com/sites/default/files/styles/djm_23_430x242/public/2025-12/Nick-Williams.webp?itok=-fwvvgYG 1x, /sites/default/files/styles/djm_25_800x450/public/2025-12/Nick-Williams.webp?itok=NsPMX21k 2x, /sites/default/files/styles/djm_25_1200x675/public/2025-12/Nick-Williams.webp?itok=Zs-wYp93 3x" alt="Nick Williams, Phonica Records stalwart and Meda Fury label founder, has died" /><p/><p>Nick Williams, the founder of London label Meda Fury and long-standing figure of record shop Phonica Records, has died.<br />
<br />
Williams passed away on Sunday, 21st December, after battling pancreatic cancer since he received a diagnosis in February. Announcing his death, Phonica said: &quot;Nick was part of the heart of Phonica Records for 16 years. From behind the counter to shaping the spirit of the shop, he gave so much of himself to this place and to the community around it. His knowledge, generosity, humour and passion for music touched countless artists, DJs, customers and friends from all over the world.&quot;<br />
<br />
His wife, who frequently DJ&#039;d as Trafford alongside him, said: &quot;It&rsquo;s unbelievably hard to write that my darling soulmate and husband, digger, DJ, Meda Fury record label creator, Phonica stalwart and music connoisseur Nick Williams has passed away on Sunday, 21st December after battling cancer since March of this year. He was so positive, so brave, still thinking of others.I have so much gratitude towards the friends and family and medical staff who helped him (and me) through this difficult time.<br />
<br />
&quot;He was one in a midgillion &mdash; unique, funny, interesting, kindhearted. He lived and breathed music. He would even listen to music all night while he slept. Sometimes sleep-talking about records. His knowledge was amazing. But also what an absolute gem of a man. There will never be another like him. I love you so so so much my darling and I will miss you until we can be reunited.&quot;<br />
<br />
Williams launched Meda Fury as an offshoot of R&amp;amp;S Records in 2014. He put out records from the likes of Eliphino, DJ Seinfeld, Lady Blacktronika, Takuya Matsumoto and lots more via the imprint, before closing it down in 2020.<br />
<br />
Revealing his cancer diagnosis in July, Williams said: &quot;It was heartbreaking to get diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in February, and extremely depressing to learn it was late stage and that it had spread to my liver, peritoneum and lymph nodes. The doctors and oncologists weren&#039;t optimistic, didn&#039;t think I would have long. They put me on Chemotherapy ASAP.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tributes to Williams have come from many prominent figures in dance music, who spoke about his kindness, passion for music, and enthusiasm for introducing records to those who walked through the doors of Phonica. In a comment, Four Tet wrote, &quot;He was always a pleasure to see in the shop and catch up with. A proper music enthusiast. He will be missed.&quot;<br />
<br />
In a comment left under Phonica&#039;s post, Rhythm Section founder Bradley Zero described Williams as a &quot;real champion behind the counter whose influence spread far and wide with the kindness and subtlety those who knew him loved him for.&quot;<br />

                <h2>Artists on Universal Music Group's roster are also expected to be given an active role in shaping how the AI tools are developed</h2><br><img src="https://www.djmag.com/sites/default/files/styles/djm_23_430x242/public/2025-12/universal-splice.jpg.webp?itok=1MxMnqS9 1x" alt="Universal and Splice to partner on new &quot;artist-centric&quot; AI music tools" /><p/><p>Universal Music Group&nbsp;(UMG) has partnered with music production platform Splice&nbsp;to jointly develop the &quot;next generation of AI-powered music creation tools for musical artists&quot;.<br />
<br />
The collaboration will see the two companies work together to build &quot;commercial AI tools&quot; and &quot;AI-powered virtual instruments&quot;. In a joint statement, they said that the link-up would be &quot;guided by a shared commitment to creative expression and artistic empowerment&quot;.<br />
<br />
As part of the agreement, artists on UMG&#039;s roster will be given an active role in helping to shape how the AI tools are developed. This will mean that UMG artists will be able to bring their own sounds directly into Splice&#039;s AI workflows as the development process goes on.<br />
<br />
Michael Nash, EVP and chief digital officer at Universal Music Group, said: &quot;We&#039;re excited to form this alliance with Splice to promote the alignment of innovation and ethicality in addressing the interests of the creative community to leverage cutting-edge AI-enabled tools to further their artistic expression. We look forward to partnering with Kakul Srivastava and her team on this critically important strategic technology front.&quot;<br />
<br />
Splice CEO Kakul Srivastava, added: &quot;We&#039;ve spent time building AI tools designed to fairly compensate creators and keep them in control. We&#039;re thankful for Universal&#039;s continued support, and excited to work together to put these commercial tools in the hands of artists everywhere, knowing they can trust the end result.&quot;<br />
<br />
Earlier this year, Splice announced that it would be integrated into the DAW, Pro Tools.<br />
<br />
In April,&nbsp;the music production platform also&nbsp;announced&nbsp;it had acquired virtual instrument company Spitfire Audio for a reported $50 million (USD). That followed the&nbsp;launch&nbsp;of a new feature for its iOS app called Splice Mic.</p>

                <h2>A number of the newly unearthed cuts date back to the 'Voodoo' era</h2><br><img src="https://www.djmag.com/sites/default/files/styles/djm_23_430x242/public/2025-12/D%27Angelo.jpeg.webp?itok=ZLCh7ZeK 1x" alt="Archive of unreleased D&#039;Angelo tracks uploaded to YouTube" /><p/><p>A number of previously unreleased D&#039;Angelo tracks have been uploaded to YouTube by a music archivist. You can listen to them below.<br />
<br />
Over the past week, an account going by the name the short archives., has shared five unreleased tracks by the late R&amp;amp;B and soul artist. Among them is a recording of the song &#039;Bitch&#039;, which has&nbsp;been long sought after by D&#039;Angelo fans, but never previously heard.<br />
<br />
Made alongside The Roots&#039; Questlove, with whom D&#039;Angelo worked on second album &#039;Voodoo&#039;, the song is widely viewed as the beginning of the era that fed into the 2000 album. It was initially intended to feature on the soundtrack for 1996 crime action film &#039;Set It Off&#039;, but ultimately wasn&#039;t used on the movie.<br />
<br />
Also newly shared online are a number of unreleased demos for &#039;Voodoo&#039;, such as &#039;Mariah&#039;, &#039;Betray My Heart&#039; and &#039;We Gotta Run &amp;amp; Pray Together&#039;, as well as a 10-minute demo version of &#039;Black Messiah&#039; album cut &#039;Back To The Future&#039;. You can check out the unreleased songs here.<br />
<br />
D&#039;Angelo passed away in October of this year at the age of 51 following a private battle with pancreatic cancer.</p>

After&nbsp;a fire ripped through the original main stage&nbsp;just two days before the festival was due to kick off in July this year, Tomorrowland&#039;s crew acted quickly and were ultimately able to&nbsp;run (mostly) as planned, showcasing 850 artists across 16 sound systems with a&nbsp;reorganised programme.<br />

                <h2>Anna's Archive said it had also scraped 256 million rows of metadata, such as artist names and album titles</h2><br><img src="https://www.djmag.com/sites/default/files/styles/djm_23_430x242/public/2025-12/open-graph-default.png.webp?itok=yBYzhQn_ 1x" alt="Activist group claims it scraped Spotify&#039;s 86 million song library" /><p/><p>An activist group has claimed it has scraped millions of tracks from&nbsp;Spotify, and will soon&nbsp;release them online.<br />
<br />
As The Guardian reports, the organisation, called Anna&#039;s Archive, said it had scraped 86 million music files from the streaming platform, as well as 256 million rows of metadata such as artist names and album titles. Spotify, which has a music library of more than 100 million, said that the leak did not represent its entire inventory of music.<br />
<br />
The streaming company added that it had &quot;identified and disabled the nefarious user accounts that engaged in unlawful scraping&quot;. Commentators have said that the scraping and any associated leak could help AI companies looking for material to develop their technology.<br />
<br />
In a statement about the leak said, representatives for Spotify said: &quot;An investigation into unauthorised access identified that a third party scraped public metadata and used illicit tactics to circumvent DRM [digital rights management] to access some of the platform&#039;s audio files.&quot; The company added at the time of writing last week that it believed that the scraped data had not yet been leaked publicly.<br />
<br />
Anna&#039;s Archive said in a blog that it wanted to create a &quot;&#039;preservation archive&#039; for music&quot;, and claimed that the scraped audio files represented 99.6% of all music listened to by Spotify&#039;s 700 million global users. The group added that the illegally obtained media would be shared via torrenting.<br />
<br />
Spotify added that it had introduced new protection methods &quot;for these types of anti-copyright attacks&quot; following the announcement by Anna&#039;s Archive announcement. The streaming company was &quot;actively monitoring for suspicious behaviour,&quot; it said.<br />
<br />
Earlier this month, it was revealed that Spotify was expected to increase its US subscription prices in early 2026.<br />
<br />
The price increase will follow&nbsp;Spotify&#039;s recent addition of lossless audio&nbsp;to its service in some territories, as well as&nbsp;its&nbsp;acquisition&nbsp;of the sample-aggregating music database WhoSampled.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Spotify continues to court controversy, with a number of artists and labels removing their work from the streaming platform. Xiu Xiu,&nbsp;Kalahari Oyster Cult&nbsp;and Deerhoof are amongst those to have exited the platform in response to CEO and co-founder Daniel Ek&#039;s connections to AI military defence company Helsing, including June&#039;s&nbsp;&nbsp;&euro;600 million investment in the firm, and a previous &euro;100 million stake acquired in 2021.&nbsp;</p>

<br />
The imprint has got underway with the unveiling of three releases, and the Kenyan producer said it will spotlight &quot;smaller acts pushing their art in interesting directions&quot;. He also said artists who release on Xternal Domain will receive 100% of their profits and retain full control over their copyright.<br />
<br />
The first three releases on Xternal Domain are &#039;Silviculture&#039; by Brighton-based dubstep producer MedianWage; &#039;Smelting&#039; by Kyiv-based experimental music artist worse; and a collaborative album by Philadelphia&#039;s 2wrist and No Author, called &#039;Exposed Functional Elements&#039;. The artwork for all three records was designed by Slikback himself.<br />
<br />
Check out the first three releases on Xternal Domain below, and follow the label on Bandcamp.<br />
<br />
Slikback released his first album for Planet Mu, &#039;Attrition&#039;, in July of this year. Read DJ Mag&#039;s review of the record, which was among our favourites of the year,&nbsp;here.</p>

                <h2>The change will take effect on 16th January, 2026</h2><br><img src="https://www.djmag.com/sites/default/files/styles/djm_23_430x242/public/2025-12/20250305072449146.png.webp?itok=6isuSBAK 1x" alt="YouTube to withdraw streaming numbers from US Billboard charts" /><p/><p>Songs streamed on YouTube will soon no longer count towards the&nbsp;Billboard&nbsp;charts in the US.<br />
<br />
The change will come into effect on 16th January, 2026, according to Lyor Cohen, YouTube&#039;s global head of music, who announced the development in a blog post last week. Cohen said the change had been made due to an ongoing dispute between the two companies related to&nbsp;Billboard&#039;s decision to weight subscriber streams more favourably than ad-supported streams in its chart tallies.<br />
<br />
Billboard&#039;s recent announcement on how it will newly weight streaming numbers means that a single stream by a YouTube or Spotify subscriber will now be equal to two-and-a-half streams by a non-subscriber. The ratio was previously three to one, meaning a free stream was worth even less.<br />
<br />
Cohen has argued that this is an &quot;outdated formula&quot; that &quot;ignores the massive engagement from fans who don&#039;t have a subscription&quot;. Further pointing out that streaming accounts for 84% of recorded music revenue in the US, Cohen added that YouTube preferred a one to one ratio in streaming numbers. It&#039;s not fully known, however, why YouTube wants free streams to count more favourably in chart data.<br />
<br />
Responding to YouTube&#039;s decision, a spokesperson for&nbsp;Billboard&nbsp;said: &quot;There are so many ways a fan can support an artist they love, and each has a specific place in the music ecosystem.&nbsp;Billboard&nbsp;strives to measure that activity appropriately; balanced by various factors including consumer access, revenue analysis, data validation and industry guidance.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is our hope that YouTube reconsiders and joins&nbsp;Billboard&nbsp;in recognising the reach and popularity of artists on all music platforms and in celebrating their achievements though the power of fans and how they interact with the music that they love.&quot;</p>

<br />
The Venezuelan raptor house pioneer&#039;s rework of the song centres around high-energy breakbeats and siren vocal effects, and retains Aurora&#039;s vocals from the original cut. You can listen to the remix below.<br />
<br />
The release of DJ Babatr&#039;s version of the song drops just two weeks on from the unveiling of TOMORA&#039;s original. Speaking about their new collaborative project, Rowlands and Aurora said: &quot;We wanted TOMORA to be a band, not two individuals. It&#039;s our musical feeling come to life.&quot;<br />
<br />
While the song is the first taste of the newly minted act, TOMORA&#039;s name has already been subject to online speculation after being added to the 2026 line-ups for a number of major festivals, such as Coachella, Colours of Ostrava, &Oslash;yafestivalen and Down The Rabbit Hole.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Earlier this year, classic tracks by The Chemical Brothers were reworked courtesy of two contemporary stars. YAZZUS included an edit of &#039;Hey Boy Her Girl&#039; on her &#039;The 2000s Pack&#039;. Meanwhile, Chris Lake took on &#039;Galvanize&#039;&nbsp;to celebrate the tune&#039;s 20th anniversary.&nbsp;</p>

<br />
Pieced together by the Chamber Music Society&#039;s founder and artistic director Brenda Vongova, the compilation brings together electronic musicians from multiple global regions whose compositions have been newly arranged in orchestral form.<br />
<br />
Among the artists whose tracks have been reworked for &#039;HARMONY&#039; are Paul van Dyk, ARTBAT, KSHMR, Francis Mercier, Kiesza and others.<br />
<br />
&quot;Electronic music is a universal language that has brought people together from all over the world, spreading peace, positivity and inclusivity,&quot; said Vongova in a statement. &quot;Through &#039;HARMONY&#039;, we are taking these powerful electronic works and reimagining them in an orchestral setting, creating a sonic bridge between genres, cultures and communities.&quot;<br />
<br />
The project&#039;s&nbsp;release was accompanied by a virtual concert broadcast through&nbsp;UN Web TV&nbsp;and the&nbsp;United Nations&#039; YouTube platforms. All streaming revenue generated by the compilation&#039;s release&nbsp;will be donated to United Nations humanitarian efforts through the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.<br />
