This was the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/shootings-montenegro-7762091b6e9d8f6cc004432cd5557faf?utm_source=copy&amp;utm_medium=share">second such incident in the town</a> in the past three years. </p><p>Hundreds gathered on Thursday evening at the main square in Cetinje for a candlelight vigil in the memory of the victims.</p><p>Police Commissioner Lazar Šćepanović described Wednesday’s shooting as “one of the biggest tragedies in the history of Montenegro.”</p><p>He said at a news conference that the victims included seven men, three women and two children, born in 2011 and 2016.</p><p>“Most of the victims were people he knew, his closest friends and relatives,” including the shooter’s sister, Šćepanović said. “This criminal act wasn’t planned or organized. It was unpredictable.”</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><div class='taboola_readmore' data='autoembed'></div><p>The shooter, identified as 45-year-old Aco Martinović, killed the owner of the bar, the bar owner's children and his own family members, officials have said. </p><p>The attacker, who first fled after the rampage, was later located and surrounded by police. He died after shooting himself in the head, police said. </p><p>Residents of Cetinje, a town of some 17,000 people, were stunned and grief-stricken. </p><p>"I knew all of these people personally, also the attacker. I think when he did that, he was out of his mind," said Vesko Milošević, a retiree from Cetnje. "What do I know, he went from place to place and killed people. Its a catastrophe.”</p><p>Vanja Popović, whose relatives are among the victims, said that “we are all in shock.”</p><p>“How can I feel after this?" Popović said. "No one expected it. You can’t even ask anyone anything.”</p><p>Police had dispatched a special unit to search for the attacker in the town, which is located about 30 kilometers (18 miles) northwest of Podgorica, the country's capital. All roads in and out of Cetinje were blocked for hours as police swarmed the streets. </p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>Police said that the shooter had died while being taken to a hospital in the capital and succumbed from the “severity of his injuries.”</p><p>Officials have said that the attacker was at the bar throughout the day with other guests when the brawl erupted. He then went home, brought back a weapon and opened fire at around 5:30 p.m. </p><p>Prosecutor Andrijana Nastić said Thursday that the attacker went to six locations during the shooting rampage, including the last one, where he shot himself. </p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>Four men were killed at the bar, she said. The shooter then moved on to another location where he killed four more people, and then two children at a third site. He then went on to kill two more people at two other locations before eventually shooting himself, Nastić said. </p><p>“Further investigation will determine the exact circumstances of the events,” she added. </p><p>The government has declared three days of national mourning starting on Thursday, and all planned New Year's festivities have been canceled throughout the country. </p><p>Prime Minister Milojko Spajić said that the government may try to impose a total ban on weapons “because we must ask ourselves after this who should be allowed to have guns in Montenegro.”</p><p>The small Adriatic Sea nation, which has a population of around 620,000 people, is known for its gun culture and many people traditionally have weapons. </p><p>In August 2022 in Cetinje, which is Montenegro’s historic capital, an attacker killed 10 people, including two children, before he was shot and killed by a passerby.</p><p>Police have said that the suspect in Wednesday's shooting received a suspended sentence in 2005 for violent behavior and had appealed his latest conviction for illegal weapons possession. Montenegrin media have reported that he was known for erratic and violent behavior.</p><p>“Instead of holiday joy ... we have been gripped by sadness over the loss of innocent lives,” Montenegro's President Jakov Milatović said in a post on X.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writers Jovana Gec and Dušan Stojanović contributed to this report from Belgrade, Serbia.</p>

                <p>ROME (AP) — The U.N. children’s fund urged governments on Thursday to prioritize the safety of migrant children after the latest <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/migration">Mediterranean shipwreck</a> left about 20 people missing and added to a gruesome annual tally.</p><p>Among the seven survivors of the New Year’s Eve wreck off the Sicilian island of Lampedusa was an 8-year-old girl whose mother is among the missing, UNICEF said. </p><p>The agency noted that last month, an 11-year-old girl found floating off Lampedusa was <a href="https://apnews.com/article/migration-italy-rescue-survivor-shipwreck-b8a08908970645664945662323ac6fee">believed to be the lone survivor</a> of a migrant boat that had left Sfax, Tunisia, with about 45 people on board.</p><p>According to the International Organization of Migration’s missing migrant tracker, 2,275 people were unaccounted for in the Mediterranean in 2024, bringing the total number of people missing since 2014 to 31,180. The vast majority -– 24,466 -- were believed to have died on the perilous central Mediterranean route, which is most often <a href="https://apnews.com/article/migrants-bandits-sos-mediterranee-libya-0b96d857a1e5d1db721fa98dd26f1a25">used by smugglers from Libya</a> and Tunisia to ferry desperate people toward Italy.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><div class='taboola_readmore' data='autoembed'></div><p>UNICEF called on governments to honor their obligations under international law regarding refugees and to prioritize the safeguarding of children. “This includes ensuring safe, legal pathways for protection and family reunification, as well as coordinated search and rescue operations, safe disembarkation, community-based reception, and access to asylum services,” the agency said in a statement.</p><p>Under Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, Italy has tried to stem arrivals by cracking down on migrant smuggling operations and deterring would-be refugees with the threat of having their asylum claims <a href="https://apnews.com/article/italy-albania-migration-centers-d94962fe17223027cffae939eef64049">processed in Albania</a>. Last year, 66,317 migrants arrived in Italy by boat, fewer than half as many as in the previous year, according to Interior Ministry statistics.</p>

She overcame the loss of her father and several relatives in the Holocaust to become one of the most successful Jewish Olympic athletes.</p><p>“These 100 years felt to me like 60,” Keleti <a href="https://apnews.com/i-love-life-oldest-living-olympic-champion-turns-100-041adec7ff961df5d1a43acb897983dc">told The Associated Press</a> on the eve of her 100th birthday. “I live well. And I love life. It’s great that I’m still healthy.”</p><p>Born Ágnes Klein in 1921 in Budapest, her career was interrupted by World War II and the cancellation of the 1940 and 1944 Olympics. Forced off her gymnastics team in 1941 because of her Jewish ancestry, Keleti went into hiding in the Hungarian countryside, where she survived the Holocaust by assuming a false identity and working as a maid.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><div class='taboola_readmore' data='autoembed'></div><div id='afs:Card:355136086733' class='hub-peek-embed' content-id='b6facb6ead67a0ec298931cb297e4579'>Hub peek embed (apf-sports) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Her mother and sister survived the war with the help of famed Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, but her father and other relatives perished at Auschwitz, among the more than half a million Hungarian Jews killed in Nazi death camps and by Hungarian Nazi collaborators.</p><p>Resuming her career after the war, Keleti was set to compete at the 1948 London Olympics, but a last-minute ankle injury dashed her hopes.</p><p>Four years later, she made her Olympic debut at the 1952 Helsinki Games at the age of 31, winning a gold medal in the floor exercise as well as a silver and two bronzes.

Germany had to shell out billions of euros to set up floating terminals to import liquefied natural gas that comes by ship, not by pipeline. Users cut back as prices soared.

Gazprom has said Moldova owes close to $709 million for past gas supplies, a figure the country has fiercely disputed. </p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>Heating and hot water supplies were abruptly cut off Wednesday to households in Transnistria, Moldova’s breakaway region that has for decades hosted Russian troops, as Russian natural gas stopped flowing to the territory, local transit operator Tiraspoltransgaz-Transnistria said. </p><p>In an online statement, the company urged residents to gather household members together in a single room, hang blankets over windows and balcony doors, and use electric heaters. It said some key facilities, including hospitals, were exempt from the cuts. </p><p>On Dec. 13, Moldova’s parliament <a href="https://apnews.com/article/moldova-energy-russia-emergency-gas-europe-transnistria-b219e5ef13c14d4529554e092caab4b5">voted in favor of imposing a state of emergency</a> in the energy sector, as fears mounted that the gas shortages could trigger a humanitarian crisis in Transnistria, for decades dependent on Russian energy supplies. </p><p>Many observers have predicted that the looming energy shortage could force people in the separatist territory to travel to Moldova proper, seeking basic amenities to get through the harsh winter and placing further strain on resources. </p><p>Moldova, Ukraine and EU politicians have repeatedly accused Moscow of weaponizing energy supplies. </p><p>On Wednesday, Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski called Ukraine's move to halt supplies a win for those opposed to the Kremlin's policies. In a post on X, Sikorski accused Moscow of systematic attempts to “blackmail Eastern Europe with the threat of cutting off gas supplies," including through a Baltic pipeline bypassing Ukraine and Poland and running directly to Germany. </p><p>Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico claimed Wednesday the end of gas flows via Ukraine “will drastically affect us all in the EU but not Russia.”</p><p>Fico, whose views on Russia have sharply differed from the European mainstream, has previously criticized Kyiv's refusal to extend the transit deal, and threatened to end electricity supplies to Ukraine in response. </p><p>Moscow can still send gas to Hungary, as well as non-EU states Turkey and Serbia, through the TurkStream pipeline across the Black Sea.</p><p>The steady reduction of Russian gas supplies to European countries has also spurred them to hasten the integration of Ukraine’s energy grids with its neighbors to the west.</p><p>Last week, private Ukrainian energy utility DTEK said it had received its first shipment of liquefied natural gas from the U.S., delivered through a newly expanded network spanning six countries from Greece to Ukraine — a significant step in reducing regional dependence on Russian energy.</p><p>Separately, overnight into New Year's Day, Russia launched a drone strike on Kyiv that left two people dead under the rubble of a damaged building, according to the city administration. At least six people were wounded across the Ukrainian capital, according to Mayor Vitali Klitschko.</p><p>Russian shelling also killed a man and wounded two women in Ukraine's southern city of Kherson, regional authorities reported. </p><p>___</p><p>Kozlowska reported from London.

After two doctrinaire popes, Francis complained in the first months of his papacy in 2013 that the church had become obsessed by <a href="https://apnews.com/general-news-793d3ba03ee649b982a94c739a16843a">“small-minded rules” about hot-button issues</a> such as abortion.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><div class='taboola_readmore' data='autoembed'></div><div id='afs:Card:057759945916' class='hub-peek-embed' content-id='212cfda93e8cfe780494f3524d51959f'>Hub peek embed (PopeFrancis) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Francis now regularly refers to procuring an abortion as “hiring a hitman to solve a problem.” </p><p>He recently <a href="https://apnews.com/article/vatican-pope-belgium-abortion-369b35f6734bdab87786ff6c4870d424">sparked outrage in Belgium</a> when he criticized its abortion law as “homicidal” and announced he wanted to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/vatican-pope-belgium-abortion-369b35f6734bdab87786ff6c4870d424">beatify Belgium's late king who abdicated for a day</a> rather than approve legislation legalizing the procedure. The Vatican recently announced that the beatification process is under way for King Baudouin, who died in 1993.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>The morning Mass marked the final big event of Francis' busy Christmas schedule. For the pope, who suffers from recurrent respiratory problems, this year's season was even more challenging with the start of the Vatican's big Holy Year, a once-every-quarter-century celebration of the faith that is expected to bring 32 million pilgrims to Rome during 2025.</p><p>Speaking to pilgrims who gathered in a sun-filled St. Peter's Square, Francis recalled the Jubilee's central message of the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/vatican-pope-debt-relief-jubilee-year-69a0baf34231291c9ac12833cd8c9119">need to forgive debts.</a> He again called for world leaders from wealthy countries to eliminate or reduce the debts owed by poorer countries.</p><p>Francis urged Christian leaders, in particular, “to provide a good example” by taking the lead to forgive debts.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s <a href="https://bit.ly/ap-twir">collaboration</a> with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

A fifth set belonged to the Megalosaurus, a ferocious 9-meter predator that left a distinctive triple-claw print and was the first dinosaur to be scientifically named two centuries ago.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><div class='taboola_readmore' data='autoembed'></div><div id='afs:Card:712874853959' class='hub-peek-embed' content-id='9fd0499419db0950099e6413a1936488'>Hub peek embed (apf-science) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>An area where the tracks cross raises questions about possible interactions between the carnivores and herbivores.</p><p>“Scientists have known about and been studying Megalosaurus for longer than any other dinosaur on Earth, and yet these recent discoveries prove there is still new evidence of these animals out there, waiting to be found," said Emma Nicholls, a vertebrate paleontologist at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History. </p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>Nearly 30 years ago, 40 sets of footprints discovered in a limestone quarry in the area were considered one of the world's most scientifically important dinosaur track sites. But that area is mostly inaccessible now and there's limited photographic evidence because it predated the use of digital cameras and drones to record the findings. </p><p>The group that worked at the site this summer took more than 20,000 digital images and used drones to create 3-D models of the prints. The trove of documentation will aid future studies and could shed light on the size of the dinosaurs, how they walked and the speed at which they moved.</p><p>“The preservation is so detailed that we can see how the mud was deformed as the dinosaur’s feet squelched in and out," said Duncan Murdock, an earth scientist at the Oxford museum. "Along with other fossils like burrows, shells and plants we can bring to life the muddy lagoon environment the dinosaurs walked through.” </p><p>The findings will be shown at a new exhibit at the museum and also broadcast on the BBC's “Digging for Britain” program next week.</p>

She had arrived in the country on Dec. 13 on a journalist visa and was arrested on charges of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/iran-italy-journalist-detain-tehran-e18b0acc385a0bac4c00146afbcc6288">violating the laws of the Islamic Republic</a>, the state-run IRNA news agency said.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><div class='taboola_readmore' data='autoembed'></div><div id='afs:Card:961996516835' class='hub-peek-embed' content-id='6656e7f9df9db8b7216a180d69dde52c'>Hub peek embed (Iran) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>The Italian and Iranian governments referred to both cases in their public statements Thursday after the Iranian ambassador was summoned to the Italian foreign ministry. That suggested the cases were very much intertwined as each country seeks the release of its citizen. Both say their detaineed national is being unjustly accused.</p><p>The Iranian Embassy to Italy described the meeting between Ambassador Mohammadreza Sabouri and the Italian foreign ministry’s secretary general, Riccardo Guariglia, as friendly. </p><p>But in a statement on X, the embassy said Abedini was being held on “false charges” and demanded his release, in what was believed to be Tehran’s first public response to the U.S. case against him.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>It insisted that Sala was being treated humanely, especially in light of Christmas and New Year’s holidays, and demanded similar treatment for Abedini.</p><p>“It is reciprocally expected from the Italian government that, in addition to expediting the release of the detained Iranian citizen, he will be provided with the things he needs,” the statement said.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>U.S. federal prosecutors have charged Abedini and a co-defendant with export control violations after FBI specialists analyzed the drone navigation system used in the Jordan attack and traced it to them. U.S. prosecutors said Abedini's Tehran-based company manufactures navigation systems for the military drone program of Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard.</p><p>Ever since the <a href="https://apnews.com/general-news-6149da2418b140c2b1d5b0ca5779bac5">1979 U.S. Embassy crisis in Iran</a>, in which dozens of U.S. hostages spent 444 days in captivity in Tehran, Iran has frequently used prisoners with Western ties as bargaining chips in negotiations.</p><p>Italian commentators have speculated that that is indeed the case as Tehran seeks Abedini's release by holding Sala, whose fate has dominated Italian headlines for days and even featured in President Sergio Mattarella’s end-of-year speech to the nation.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>The Italian foreign ministry said it summoned Sabouri, the Iranian ambassador, to demand Sala’s release and ensure “dignified detention conditions in full respect of human rights,” including consular access and visitation. </p><p>Later in the day, Premier <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/giorgia-meloni">Giorgia Meloni</a> convened a high-level meeting with the Italian justice and foreign ministers to discuss the Sala and Abedini cases, and met separately with Sala’s mother. In a statement, Meloni’s office said the government renewed its call for Sala’s immediate release and “treatment that respects human dignity” in the meantime.</p><p>Concerning Abedini, the government reaffirmed that “all are guaranteed equal treatment in compliance with Italian laws and international conventions.”</p><p>Abedini’s Italian lawyer, Alfredo De Francesco, had asked the Milan court this week to grant him house arrest. On Thursday, Milan’s general prosecutor Francesca Nanni argued against the request, saying Abedini was a flight risk — especially since the Iranian government owned the residence in Italy that was proposed to house him.</p><p>“The circumstances represented in the request, particularly the provision of an apartment and financial support from Iran’s consulate … do not constitute an adequate guarantee against the danger of flight of the Iranian national whose extradition the U.S. has requested,” the adnkronos news agency reported, citing a statement from Nanni that was confirmed by her office.</p><p>The U.S. Justice Department has declined to comment on the case.</p><p>Sala’s mother, for her part, said she just wants her daughter to come home and be treated humanely by Iran in the meantime. </p><p>Speaking to reporters outside of Meloni’s office after the meeting, Elisabetta Vernoni said her daughter had reported to her on Wednesday — their second phone call — that she was sleeping on the floor in a cell usually used to punish prisoners.</p><p>“I am a bit like Cecilia, I am a bit of a soldier. I wait and respect the work they are doing,” Vernoni said. </p><p>“But prison conditions for a 29-year-old girl who has done nothing must be such that they cannot scar her for life,” she added.</p>

She was 93. </p><p>Missoni died peacefully on Wednesday, Missoni SpA and the Missoni family said in a joint statement.</p><p>Local officials offered condolences on Thursday and recalled Missoni’s ties to the small northern city of Gallarate where the Missoni brand was born in an artisan’s shop in 1953.</p><p>Born Rosita Jelmini, Missoni grew up in a family that owned a textile factory that produced shawls. When she met and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/897b27b979ae4d1482c9b8f35f288e4f">married Ottavio Missoni</a>, they founded their eponymous fashion house in Gallarate that would turn into a fashion dynasty, with the couple’s three children and their offspring involved in expanding the brand.</p><p>The Missonis got their first break in 1958, when the Rinascente department store commissioned 500 colorful vertically striped shirt dresses — the first to carry the Missoni label. </p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><div class='taboola_readmore' data='autoembed'></div><p>The Missonis first showed their collection in Milan in 1966 and the brand helped turn the city into a fashion mecca.</p><p>Their signature fashions, with the trademark graphic zigzags, long had a reputation for wearability and for surviving many seasons of changing trends. Family members were often the brand's best models, wearing Missoni graphic creations in everyday life.</p><p>The founders turned over the business to their children in 1997, though Rosita remained involved in the Missoni home collection. </p><p>In 2013, as the company celebrated its 60th anniversary, the family endured <a href="https://apnews.com/general-news-beauty-and-fashion-fashion-40c025df773d4ca8ad7c8077c823d22b">a double tragedy</a>. The eldest Missoni son and the company’s CEO, Vittorio Missoni, died when a plane carrying him and five others disappeared off Venezuela. It took six months to locate the plane wreckage in the seas off the South American country, during which time patriarch Ottavio Missoni died, aged 92.</p><p>In 2018, the family sold a 41.2%-stake to the Italian investment fund FSI, but maintained majority control of the house.</p><p>In 2021, the youngest daughter, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/europe-business-health-coronavirus-pandemic-lifestyle-293082e937c0c1e437c99dd6f4fba35a">Angela Missoni, stepped down</a> as creative director after 24 years.</p><p>There was no immediate word on funeral arrangements. </p>

The shooter was on the run. </p><p>Police identified the attacker as 45-year-old Aco Martinovic. He killed the owner of the bar in the city of Cetinje, the bar owner's children and his own family members, Interior Minister Danilo Saranovic said at a news conference.</p><p>“At this moment, we are focused on arresting him,” Saranovic told reporters. </p><p>Police dispatched special troops to search for the attacker in Cetinje, located some 30 kilometers (18 miles) northwest of the capital, Podgorica. All the roads in and out of the city have been blocked as police swarmed the streets. </p><p>Saranovic described the suspect as dangerous and appealed on the residents to stay indoors. </p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><div class='taboola_readmore' data='autoembed'></div><p>“The level of rage and brutality shows that sometimes such people ... are even more dangerous than members of organized criminal gangs,” Saranovic said. </p><p>Martinovic was at the bar throughout the day with other guests when the brawl erupted, said Police Commissioner Lazar Scepanovic. He said that Martinovic then went home, brough back a weapon and opened fire at around 5:30 p.m. </p><p>“He killed four people” at the bar, before heading out and then continued shooting at three more locations, said Scepanovic. "He tried to take the lives of four more people, and then fled with the vehicle he was using, which we have found.” </p><p>He said that the suspect received a suspended sentence in 2005 for violent behavior and has appealed his latest conviction for illegal possession of weapons. Montenegrin media have reported he was known for erratic and violent behavior.</p><p>Small Montenegro, which has some 620,000 people, is known for its gun culture and many people traditionally have weapons. </p><p>Wednesday’s shooting was the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/shootings-montenegro-7762091b6e9d8f6cc004432cd5557faf">second shooting rampage over the past three years in Cetinje</a>, Montenegro’s historic capital. An attacker also killed 10 people, including two children, in August 2022 before he was shot and killed by a passerby in Cetinje.</p><p>President Jakov Milatovic said he was “shocked and stunned” by the tragedy. “Instead of holiday joy ... we have been gripped by sadness over the loss of innocent lives,” Milatovic said on the social media platform X. </p><p>Prime Minister Milojko Spajic went to the hospital where the wounded were being treated and announced three days of mourning. He said “all police teams” were out searching for the suspect. </p><p>“This is a terrible tragedy that has affected us all,” Spajic said. </p>

Events planned for New Year's Day, including nippy outdoor swims and a bathtub boat race, were scrapped.</p><p>London, which was able to launch its massive fireworks display on the River Thames in front of Big Ben, had to postpone the start of its New Year’s Day parade and grounded inflatable floats due to the blustery and soggy conditions. </p><p>Cheerleaders and members of bands that marched through central London pulled transparent coverings over their bright costumes to take shelter from rain. </p><p>Warnings that indicate flooding is expected were issued at one point to more than 150 communities across the U.K., with most being in northern England. Later in the day, dozens of those warnings had been lifted. </p><p>Several trains were canceled because of high water around the tracks and some highways were closed.</p><p>With temperatures dropping, there were ice warnings until late Thursday morning for Northern Ireland, parts of North Wales, England and Scotland. And a three-day snow warning was issued for the coming weekend for much of England and Scotland.</p>

He was 96.</p><p>The office of the President of Estonia, Alar Karis, announced on its website that Rüütel had died on Tuesday. </p><p>A trained agriculturalist, Rüütel was almost 50 when, in 1977, he began serving in high-ranking positions within the communist party of the Soviet republic of Estonia. In 1983, he was elected chairman of the republic’s supreme council, becoming the highest-ranking communist official in Estonia.</p><p>Soon, however, Rüütel was using his position to prepare for Estonia’s split from the Soviet Union, which had occupied the tiny European country on the Baltic Sea in 1940. In November 1988, Rüütel was a key figure in preparing a declaration of independence, with full sovereignty following three years later.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><div class='taboola_readmore' data='autoembed'></div><p>In the newly independent Estonia, which inherited a sizable ethnic Russian minority as part of its Soviet legacy, Rüütel advocated social democratic policies and support for farmers, and in 1994 he helped form the People’s Union, a left-leaning party that took part in several ruling coalitions.</p><p>Rüütel was elected president in 2001, succeeding the highly popular Lennart Meri and serving the next five years while shepherding the Baltic nation into NATO and the European Union in 2004. He sought reelection for a second five-year term but was defeated by Toomas Hendrik Ilves in 2006.</p><p>Rüütel will be buried with full state honors, Estonian public broadcaster ERR reported on Wednesday. It did not give a date for the funeral. </p>
