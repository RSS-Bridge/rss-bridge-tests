It was premeditated and an evil act,” said Christopher Raia, the deputy assistant director of the FBI's counterterrorism division, calling Jabbar “100% inspired” by the Islamic State.</p><p>The attack along Bourbon Street killed 14 revelers, along with Jabbar, 42, who was fatally shot in a firefight with police after steering his speeding truck around a barricade and plowing into the crowd. About 30 people were injured.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><div class='taboola_readmore' data='autoembed'></div><div id='afs:Card:738076027554' class='hub-peek-embed' content-id='5bbf5fdc715c4d0d4c8764dd8da22720'>Hub peek embed (IslamicStategroup) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>It was the deadliest IS-inspired assault on U.S. soil in years, laying bare what federal officials have warned is a resurgent international terrorism threat. It also comes as the FBI and other agencies brace for dramatic leadership upheaval — and likely policy changes — after President-elect Donald Trump's administration takes office.</p><p>Raia stressed that there was no indication of a connection between the New Orleans attack and the explosion Wednesday of a Tesla Cybertruck <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-hotel-explosion-tesla-cybertruck-5c5a8fd13a50e2bcde46370ae926d427">filled with explosives</a> outside Trump’s Las Vegas hotel. The person inside that truck, a decorated U.S. Army Green Beret, shot himself in the head just before detonation, authorities said.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>The FBI continued to hunt for clues about Jabbar but said that a day into its investigation, it was confident he was not aided by anyone else in the attack, which killed <a href="https://apnews.com/article/new-orleans-killed-crash-terrorist-attack-9f2fbcc3e48d8b391590f60969e80e61">an 18-year-old aspiring nurse</a>, a single mother, a father of two and a former Princeton University football star, among others.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>The attack plans also included the placement of crude bombs in the neighborhood in an apparent attempt to cause more carnage, officials said. Two improvised explosive devices left in coolers several blocks apart were rendered safe at the scene. Other devices were determined to be nonfunctional.</p><p>Officials reviewed surveillance video showing people standing near one of the coolers but concluded that they were not connected “in any way" with the attack, though investigators still want to speak with them as witnesses, Raia said.</p><p>Investigators were also trying to understand more about Jabbar's path to radicalization, which they say culminated with him picking up a rented truck in Houston on Dec. 30 and driving it to New Orleans the following night.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>The FBI recovered a black Islamic State flag from his rented pickup and reviewed five videos posted to Facebook, including one in which he said he originally planned to harm his family and friends but "was concerned that news headlines would not focus on the “war between the believers and the disbelievers,” Raia said. Jabbar also stated that he joined IS before last summer, and he provided a last will and testament, the FBI said.</p><p>Jabbar joined the Army in 2007, serving on active duty in human resources and information technology and deploying to Afghanistan from 2009 to 2010, the service said. He transferred to the Army Reserve in 2015 and left in 2020 with the rank of staff sergeant.</p><p>A U.S. government official, speaking on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to speak publicly, said Jabbar traveled to Egypt in 2023, staying in Cairo for a week, before returning to the U.S. and then traveling to Toronto for three days. It was not immediately clear what he did during those travels.</p><p>Abdur-Rahim Jabbar, Jabbar's younger brother, told The Associated Press on Thursday that it “doesn’t feel real” that his brother could have done this.</p><p>“I never would have thought it’d be him,” he said. “It’s completely unlike him.”</p><p>He said that his brother had been isolated in the last few years, but that he had also been in touch with him recently and had not seen any signs of radicalization.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>“It’s completely contradictory to who he was and how his family and his friends know him,” he said.</p><p>Chris Pousson, of Beaumont, Texas, said he became friends with Shamsud-Din Jabbar in middle school, describing him as someone who was quiet and reserved and did not get into trouble.</p><p>After high school, he said, they reconnected on Facebook around 2008 or 2009 and would message back and forth throughout the next decade.</p><p>“If any red flags would have popped off, I would have caught them, and I would have contacted the proper authorities,” he said. “But he didn’t give anything to me that would have suggested that he is capable of doing what happened.”</p><p>In New Orleans on Thursday, a still-reeling city inched back toward normal operations. </p><p>Authorities finished processing the scene early in the morning, removing the last of the bodies, and Bourbon Street — famous worldwide for music, open-air drinking and festive vibes — reopened for business by early afternoon.</p><p>The Sugar Bowl college football playoff game between Notre Dame and Georgia, initially set for Wednesday night and postponed by a day in the interest of national security, was played Thursday evening. The city also planned to host the Super Bowl next month.</p><p>New Orleans "is not only ready for game day today, but we’re ready to continue to host large-scale events in our city because we are built to host at every single turn,” New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell said.</p><p>___</p><p>Tucker reported from Washington, and Mustian reported from Black Mountain, North Carolina.

It was just insane, like the closest thing to a war zone that I’ve ever seen.”</p><p>Dedeaux was a responsible daughter who helped take care of her siblings, Parsons said.

Bech attended the high school, where he played wide receiver, quarterback, punt returner and defensive back, NOLA.com <a href="https://www.nola.com/news/former-stm-football-player-tiger-bech-killed-in-new-orleans-attack/article_db842691-a39d-5228-85ea-ceb98b6eaa8b.html?dicbo=v2-sHK7FBu">reported</a>.</p><p>Bech played football at Princeton University before graduating in 2021. Most recently he was working as an investment trader at a New York brokerage firm.</p><p>Marty Cannon, STM principal and former coach of Bech, said he was charismatic, intelligent and an incredibly talented football player. He regularly returned home to visit his tight-knit family, close friends and people at the school. He was home over Christmas.</p><p>“We live in a relatively small community here where not a lot of people leave but many do," Cannon said. “I'm not surprised at all that Tiger could take off from south Louisiana and go off and get an amazing education at a place like Princeton and then lock himself into a community up there and just flourish. He’s that kind of guy.”</p><p>Princeton football coach Bob Surace said Wednesday that he had been texting with Bech’s father, sharing memories of the player, who was a school kick returner and receiver from 2017 to 2019.

Clark County Sheriff Kevin McMahill said Matthew Livelsberger, a 37-year-old Green Beret, likely planned a more damaging attack but the steel-sided vehicle absorbed much of the force from the crudely built explosive.</p><p>Damage from the blast was mostly limited to the interior of the truck because the explosion “vented out and up” and didn’t hit the Trump hotel doors just a few feet away, the sheriff said.</p><p>“The level of sophistication is not what we would expect from an individual with this <a href="https://apnews.com/article/military-extremism-pentagon-veterans-terrorism-capitol-riot-jan-6-0c1fdd7b6b761e9c9e8556a9b9e45dc9">type of military experience</a>,” said Kenny Cooper, a special agent in charge for the the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><div class='taboola_readmore' data='autoembed'></div><div id='afs:Card:197304610647' class='hub-peek-embed' content-id='5c5a8fd13a50e2bcde46370ae926d427'>Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Authorities are still working to determine a motive.</p><p>“It’s not lost on us that it’s in front of the Trump building, that it’s a Tesla vehicle, but we don’t have information at this point that definitively tells us or suggests it was because of this particular ideology,” said Spencer Evans, the Las Vegas FBI’s special agent in charge.</p><p>Livelsberger had recently returned from an overseas assignment in Germany and was on approved leave when he died, according to a U.S. official. </p><p>A law enforcement official said investigators learned through interviews that he may have gotten into a fight with his wife about relationship issues shortly before he rented the Tesla and bought the guns. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the ongoing investigation. </p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>Among the charred items found inside the truck were a handgun at Livelsberger's feet, another firearm, a number of fireworks, a passport, a military ID, credit cards, an iPhone and a smartwatch, McMahill said. Authorities said both guns were purchased legally.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>Investigators identified the vehicle's driver — who was burned beyond recognition — as Livelsberger, of Colorado Springs, on Thursday. The cause of death was suicide by gunshot, according to the Clark County coroner.</p><p>Livelsberger served in the Green Berets, highly trained special forces who work to counter terrorism abroad and train partners. He had served in the Army since 2006, rising through the ranks with a long career of overseas assignments, deploying twice to Afghanistan and serving in Ukraine, Tajikistan, Georgia and Congo, the Army said. </p><p>He was awarded a total of five Bronze Stars, including one with a valor device for courage under fire, a combat infantry badge and an Army Commendation Medal with valor. </p><p>McMahill said Livelsberger rented the Tesla electric vehicle in Denver on Saturday and the sheriff displayed a map showing that it was charged in the Colorado town of Monument near Colorado Springs on Monday. On New Year’s Eve, it was charged in Trinidad, Colorado, and three towns in New Mexico along the Interstate 40 corridor.</p><p>Then on Wednesday, the day of the explosion, it was charged in three Arizona towns before video showed it on the Las Vegas Strip about 7:30 a.m.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>McMahill said investigators obtained charging station photos showing Livelsberger “was the individual that was driving this vehicle” and was alone.</p><p>“We’re not aware of any other subjects involved in this particular case,” the sheriff said.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>Authorities searched a townhouse in Colorado Springs, Colorado, on Thursday as part of the investigation. Neighbors said the man who lived there had a wife and a baby and did not give any sign of posing a danger to anyone.</p><p>Cindy Helwig, who lives diagonally across a narrow street separating the homes, said she last saw the man she knew as Matthew about two weeks ago when he asked her if she had a tool he needed to fix the SUV he was working on. </p><p>“He was a normal guy,” said Helwig, who said she last saw his wife and baby earlier this week. Helwig noted that people in the townhome on a hill with views of the mountains don’t interact much except for when they’re getting the mail or walking their dogs.</p><p>The explosion of the truck, packed with firework mortars and camp fuel canisters, came hours after 42-year-old Shamsud-Din Bahar Jabbar <a href="https://apnews.com/article/new-orleans-car-bourbon-street-1685016388d65039ce62e720aab2ba14">rammed a truck into a crowd</a> in New Orleans’ famed French Quarter early on New Year’s Day, killing at least 14 people before being shot to death by police. That crash was being investigated as a terrorist attack. The FBI said Thursday that they believe Jabbar acted alone, reversing its position from a day earlier that he likely worked with others. </p><p>Both Livelsberger and Jabbar spent time at the base formerly known as Fort Bragg, a massive Army base in North Carolina that is home to multiple Army special operations units. However, one of the officials who spoke to the AP said there is no overlap in their assignments at the base, now called Fort Liberty. </p><p>Chris Raia, FBI deputy assistant director, said Thursday that officials have found “no definitive link” between the New Orleans attack and the truck explosion in Las Vegas.</p><p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk said Wednesday afternoon on X that “we have now confirmed that the explosion was caused by very large fireworks and/or a bomb carried in the bed of the rented Cybertruck and is unrelated to the vehicle itself."</p><p>Musk has recently become a member of President-elect Donald Trump’s inner circle. Neither Trump nor Musk was in Las Vegas early Wednesday. Both had attended Trump’s New Year’s Eve party at his South Florida estate.</p><p>Musk spent an estimated $250 million during the presidential campaign to support the former president. He was at Trump’s resort on election night and has been a frequent guest there. Trump has named Musk, the world’s richest man, to co-lead a new effort to find ways to cut the government’s size and spending.</p><p>___</p><p>Copp, Richer and Long contributed from Washington.

The bureau also is posting previously unreleased video of the suspect placing one of the bombs.</p><p>A host of basic questions remains unanswered four years later. For starters, investigators haven’t determined if the suspect is a man or a woman. Nor have they established a clear link between the pipe bombs and the <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/capitol-siege">Jan. 6, 2021, riot</a> at the Capitol by a mob of Donald Trump's supporters.</p><p>The FBI “can’t work on assumptions," said David Sundberg, assistant director in charge of the bureau's Washington field office.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><div class='taboola_readmore' data='autoembed'></div><div id='afs:Card:171389957339' class='hub-peek-embed' content-id='ea85b6fe5fe9140f1c75b7ee8c0554b2'>Hub peek embed (DonaldTrump) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>“Without being able to confirm the suspect’s identity, it is very hard to definitively establish motive," Sundberg told The Associated Press. “Therefore, it would be difficult for us to state that there is a link, although we can’t state there is not one.”</p><p>In the absence of harder evidence, Republican lawmakers and right-wing media outlets have promoted <a href="https://apnews.com/article/jan-6-trump-cassidy-hutchinson-capitol-188ee6406b93f42eb946d28f5213de3d">conspiracy theories</a> about the pipe bombs. <a href="https://cha.house.gov/_cache/files/d/9/d96ba6ce-03fb-4fc8-a4a7-5b5daf19d064/4F510144C1F427873D3298D955C8E19F.initial-findings-report.pdf">House Republicans</a> also have criticized security lapses, questioning how law enforcement failed to detect the bombs for 17 hours.</p><p>“We remain focused on conducting an investigation using all of the tools we have at our disposal,” Sundberg said. “But it is incumbent upon us to follow facts and evidence.”</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>The FBI has assessed over 600 tips, reviewed about 39,000 video files and conducted more than 1,000 interviews over the past four years. Images show the suspect was wearing a gray hooded sweatshirt, a face mask, black gloves and a black and grey pair of Nike Air Max Speed Turf shoes with a yellow logo. The person also wore or carried a backpack containing the bombs.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>Surveillance video captured the suspect placing the pipe bombs near the committees' offices between 7:30 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. on Jan. 5, 2021. Nobody was hurt before the bombs were rendered safe, but the FBI says both devices could have been lethal.</p><p><a href="https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/2024-08/OIG-24-42-Aug24-Redacted.pdf">Kamala Harris</a>, then the Vice President-elect, was inside the DNC offices when the pipe bomb was found outside the building about 1:05 p.m. on Jan. 6. Before the bomb was deactivated, then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's motorcade <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/29/us/politics/pelosi-jan-6-pipe-bomb.html">passed by the DNC building</a> as she was evacuated from the Capitol, according to House Republicans.</p><p>This week, the FBI is releasing a minute-long video that shows the suspect sitting on a park bench outside the DNC before placing the first bomb there at about 7:54 p.m. The suspect placed the second bomb about 8:16 p.m., in an alley behind the RNC, the FBI says.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>The FBI also is releasing closeup images of the type of Nike sneakers worn by the suspect. Fewer than 25,000 pairs of the same shoe were sold between August 2018 and January 2021, according to the FBI.</p><p>“Based on attire, those are probably the most remarkable or distinctive feature when it comes to clothing the suspect wore,” Sundberg said. “We're hoping that somebody might recognize that.”</p><p>The FBI used surveillance footage to track the suspect's movements through Capitol Hill on the night of Jan. 5. The suspect initially is captured on video at about 7:34 p.m. at the intersection of First Street and North Carolina Avenue. The suspect is last seen on camera around 8:18 p.m. heading east on Rumsey Court.</p><p>“The suspect in this case did a very good job covering themselves up at a time that this would not be abnormal, so it didn’t raise any attention,” Sundberg said, referring to face masking during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Video of the suspect was sporadically available and often of poor quality, according to Sundberg. The 17-hour gap between the planting and discovery of the pipe bombs made it more difficult to identify potential witnesses, he said.</p><p>Authorities previously offered a <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/washingtondc/news/500000-reward-remains-in-effect-for-information-about-capitol-hill-pipe-bomber">reward of up to $500,000</a> for information leading to the suspect’s arrest and conviction.</p><p>President-elect Trump, who returns to the White House on Jan. 20, repeatedly has vowed to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/capitol-riot-trump-election-pardon-justice-department-889129b9696dff4a2929234f3a8f1042">pardon some or many of the rioters</a> who stormed the Capitol. More than 1,500 people have been charged with Jan. 6-related crimes. About 1,100 have been convicted and sentenced. Over 700 defendants got terms of imprisonment ranging from a few days to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/enrique-tarrio-capitol-riot-seditious-conspiracy-sentencing-da60222b3e1e54902db2bbbb219dc3fb">22 years</a>.</p><p>Sundberg said he doesn’t expect the change in administration to alter the course of the FBI’s pipe bomb investigation.</p><p>“We don’t know who the suspect is,” he added. “And I expect that we will continue to work this case until its logical conclusion and we identify a suspect.”</p>

(AP) — Two people died and 18 were injured Thursday when a small plane crashed through the roof of a sprawling furniture manufacturing building in Southern California where at least 200 people were working, police said.</p><p>The identities of the people who died, and whether they were in the plane or on the ground, was not yet known, said Kristy Wells, a Fullerton police spokesperson.</p><p>The plane crashed less than two minutes after taking off from the Fullerton Municipal Airport in Orange County, located just six miles (10 kilometers) from Disneyland, according to the flight-tracking website FlightAware. </p><p>Security camera footage from Rucci Forged, a wheel manufacturer across the street, shows the plane was tilted on its side as it dove into the building, causing a fiery explosion and black plume of smoke.</p><p>Firefighters and police arrived on scene and battled the blaze and evacuated surrounding businesses, Wells said. </p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><div class='taboola_readmore' data='autoembed'></div><p>Chris Villalobos, an airport operations worker, came to the warehouse to see what had happened after receiving a phone call about a plane going down nearby.</p><p>He said the owner of the aircraft was a regular at the airport and has frequently taken off from there.</p><p>“He has a hangar here and everything,” Villalobos said.</p><p>Villalobos said that after taking off, the pilot told air traffic control he was going to turn around to make an emergency landing, but it was unclear what the issue with the plane was.</p><p>The building was occupied by Michael Nicholas Designs, a furniture upholstery manufacturer, according to a sign on a door, and there appeared to be sewing machines and textile stock inside.</p><p>Ten people were taken to the hospital, while eight were treated and released at the scene, police said. There were two confirmed deaths, according to Wells.</p><p>The Federal Aviation Administration said the plane was a single-engine Van's RV-10, a four-seat aircraft.</p><p>The airport in Fullerton has one runway and a heliport. Metrolink, a regional train line, is nearby and flanks a residential neighborhood and commercial warehouse buildings. </p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>The Fullerton City Council posted a statement on social media calling the crash a “solemn tragedy.”</p><p>“The City of Fullerton is committed to providing support for all those affected and working with the agencies involved to uncover the details of this incident,” Mayor Fred Jung said in the statement. “We are grateful for the strength of our community and the compassion we show one another in times of crisis.”</p><p>Another four-seat plane crashed into a tree a half-mile from the airport last November while making an emergency landing right after takeoff, the <a href="https://www.ocregister.com/2024/11/25/2-suffer-moderate-injuries-after-4-seat-airplane-makes-emergency-landing-in-fullerton/">Orange County Register reported</a>. Both people on board suffered moderate injuries.</p><p>Fullerton is a city of about 140,000 people some 25 miles (40 kilometers) southeast of Los Angeles.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writer Amy Taxin in Orange County, California, and photographer Eugene Garcia in Fullerton, California, contributed. </p>

It began on Dec. 3 when Yoon, apparently frustrated that his policies were blocked by an opposition-dominated parliament, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-martial-law-north-korea-emergency-b310df4fece42c27051f58b8951f346f">declared martial law</a> and dispatched troops to surround the National Assembly.</p><p>Parliament overturned the declaration within hours in an unanimous vote and impeached Yoon himself on Dec. 14, while South Korean authorities opened a criminal investigation into the events. Yoon has remained defiant, ignoring requests for questioning and vowing to fight to remain in office.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><div class='taboola_readmore' data='autoembed'></div><div id='afs:Card:197304610647' class='hub-peek-embed' content-id='1779809dc6b2c7e5a9478bac17ca7585'>Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Four hours after dozens of investigators and police officers were seen entering the gate of the residence in Seoul to execute a warrant for Yoon’s detention, the dramatic scene appeared to have developed into a standoff.</p><p>The anti-corruption agency didn’t immediately reply to questions about whether investigators successfully entered Yoon’s residential building, but South Korea’s YTN television reported scuffles as investigators and police confronted the presidential security forces. </p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>Seok Dong-hyeon, one of several lawyers on Yoon’s legal team, confirmed that the investigators arrived at the building but said it was unlikely that they would be able to detain the president on Friday. He said the agency’s efforts to detain Yoon were “reckless” and showed an “outrageous discard for law.”</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>South Korea’s Defense Ministry confirmed that the investigators and police officers got past a military unit guarding the residence’s grounds before arriving at the building. The presidential security service, which controls the residence itself, refused to comment on whether its members were confronting investigators and whether they planned to block the detention attempt. </p><p>The hourslong standoff prompted the liberal opposition Democratic Party to call on the country’s acting leader, Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok, to order the presidential security service to stand down. Choi, who also serves as finance minister, didn’t immediately comment on the situation. </p><p>“We warn presidential security service chief Park Jong-joon not to further participate in a rebellion. Do not drag the upright staff of the presidential security service and other public officials into the depths of crime,” said Jo Seung-lae, a Democratic lawmaker. Choi must “remember that swiftly addressing the rebellion and preventing further chaos is your responsibility,” Jo said. </p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>In a defiant New Year’s message to conservative supporters rallying outside his residence, Yoon said he will “fight to the end” against “anti-state forces.” His lawyers have described the warrant as “invalid” and “illegal,” and said that the presidential security force could arrest police trying to execute it.</p><p>Thousands of police officers gathered at Yoon’s residence and formed a perimeter around a growing group of pro-Yoon protesters, who braved subfreezing temperatures for hours, waving South Korean and American flags while chanting slogans in his support. There were no immediate reports of major clashes.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>A Seoul court issued a warrant for Yoon’s detention on Tuesday after he evaded <a href="https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-yoon-suk-yeol-martial-law-rebellion-christmas-47b89c37a752596c758489b5694ca4df">multiple requests to appear for questioning</a> and blocked searches of his office in Seoul, hindering an investigation into whether his ill-conceived power grab on Dec. 3 amounted to rebellion. </p><p>The warrant is valid for one week, and investigators may make another attempt to detain Yoon if they are unable to do so on Friday.</p><p>Investigators from the anti-corruption agency were earlier seen loading boxes into several vehicles before leaving their building in the city of Gwacheon early in the morning. Television footage later showed some of those vehicles weaving between police buses that tightly packed and barricaded the streets near Yoon’s residence. </p><p>If Yoon is detained, the anti-corruption agency will have 48 hours to either request a warrant for his formal arrest or release him. Yoon’s defense minister, police chief and several top military commanders have already been arrested over their roles in the period of martial law.</p><p>Yoon Kap-keun, another lawyer representing the president, described the investigators’ efforts to detain him as illegal and said they would plan to pursue unspecified legal steps against the anti-corruption agency. </p><p>Yoon Suk Yeol’s lawyers have argued the court’s detainment warrant is invalid, claiming that the anti-corruption agency lacks the legal authority to investigate rebellion charges. They also accuse the court of bypassing a law that says locations potentially linked to military secrets cannot be seized or searched without the consent of the person in charge.</p><p>The lawyers have said police officers would be exceeding their legal authority if they assist in detaining Yoon, and could face arrest by either the “presidential security service or any citizens.” They didn’t elaborate further on the claim. </p><p>Critics accused Yoon of inciting his supporters to obstruct attempts to detain him. South Korean law permits anyone to make an arrest to stop an active crime.</p><p>The Democratic Party, which drove the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-martial-law-yoon-impeach-6432768aafc8b55be26215667e3c19d0">legislative vote that impeached Yoon Suk Yeol on Dec. 14</a> over his imposition of martial law, accused the president of trying to mobilize his supporters to block his detention and called for law enforcement authorities to execute the warrant immediately.</p><p>Yoon Kap-keun, the president’s lawyer, filed a challenge with the Seoul Western District Court on Thursday to block both the detention warrant for Yoon Suk Yeol and a related search warrant for his residence. The lawyer argued that both warrants violate criminal laws and the constitution.</p><p>Yoon’s presidential powers were suspended following a National Assembly vote to impeach him on Dec. 14 over his imposition of martial law, which lasted only hours but has triggered weeks of political turmoil, halted high-level diplomacy and rattled financial markets. Yoon’s fate now lies with the Constitutional Court, which has begun deliberations on whether to uphold the impeachment and formally remove Yoon from office or reinstate him.</p><p>To formally end Yoon’s presidency, at least six justices on the nine-member Constitutional Court must vote in favor.</p><p>The National Assembly voted last week to also impeach Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, who became acting president after Yoon’s powers were suspended, over his reluctance to fill three Constitutional Court vacancies ahead of the court’s review of Yoon’s case. </p><p>Facing growing pressure, the new acting president, Choi, appointed two new justices on Tuesday, which could increase the chances of the court upholding Yoon’s impeachment.</p><p>Yoon’s imposition of martial law ended after only six hours when the National Assembly voted 190-0 to lift it despite attempts by heavily armed soldiers to prevent them from voting.</p><p>Yoon has defended his martial law decree as a necessary act of governance, portraying it as a temporary warning against the Democratic Party, which he has described as an “anti-state” force obstructing his agenda with its legislative majority.</p>

He serves as secretary for the conference, which sets policy for the federal court system and is led by Chief Justice John Roberts.</p><p>A referral in this case isn’t necessary, Conrad said, because two Democratic senators called on Attorney General Merrick Garland to appoint a special counsel over the summer. No such appointment has been publicly made.</p><p>The group Fix the Court said the financial disclosure law is clear and should apply to justices. “The Conference’s letters further underscore the need for Congress to create a new and transparent mechanism to investigate the justices for ethics violations since the Conference is unwilling to act upon the one method we had presumed existed to do that,” Executive Director Gabe Roth said in a statement. </p><p>Conrad also sent a similar response to a separate complaint from a conservative legal group, the Center for Renewing America, in regard to Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson’s reports on the source of her husband's consulting income. Jackson has since amended her disclosures and also agreed to updated reporting requirements, Conrad wrote.</p>

It felt safe,” said Shannon Horsey, a Georgia fan in her 40s who lives in Austin, Texas. “Coming in they searched my bag thoroughly. So I felt like, OK, they're really paying attention.”</p><p>Horsey was in New Orleans with her husband, Joe, a 48-year-old Georgia graduate, and their teenage children, Jack and Zoe.</p><p>They extended their stay after the game, originally scheduled for Wednesday night, was postponed because of an attack by a man who <a href="https://apnews.com/live/new-orleans-truck-attack-updates">drove a pickup truck into crowds in the French Quarter</a>, killing 14 New Year’s revelers before police killed the attacker in a shootout.

"So, I kind of felt like this is probably one of the safest places to be in the city.”</p><p>Joe Horsey said the pregame crowd was larger than he expected but he also found the “energy lower than a normal football game.”</p><p>“You could sense the musicians trying to get people riled up. People are kind of going through the paces, a little bit in shock, but trying to make the best out of the day,” he said.</p><p>It also seemed to Horsey that opposing fans were being a little more polite to one another than at a typical game.</p><p>“SEC football can get nasty on game day and can get a little raucous," he said. "But there's a little different sense of civility and that there's bigger things than football.”</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>Flags were at half-staff outside nearby government buildings in memory of those killed in the attack, which has been labeled by authorities as <a href="https://apnews.com/article/new-orleans-car-attack-bourbon-street-5bbf5fdc715c4d0d4c8764dd8da22720">an act of terrorism</a>.</p><p>“Obviously the events that occurred were very challenging, and I just want everybody to know that the Notre Dame family, every single person in our locker room is praying for those families,” Notre Dame quarterback Riley Leonard said. “I also want to thank the New Orleans police department for responding the way they did and creating a safe environment for us to play today, so quickly after the events.”</p><p>The attack occurred on Bourbon Street, which runs through the heart of the French Quarter and is famously lined with bars, restaurants and clubs, near the corner of Canal Street, a main downtown artery.</p><p>The crime scene, which was gradually cleared so it could be reopened to the public on Thursday, is about a mile’s walk from the Superdome.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>Security was ramped up in and around the stadium.</p><p>Police blocked regular traffic from passing by the main Superdome entrance on Poydras Street, an eight-lane downtown artery.</p><p>A helicopter circled overhead.</p><p>Security officers around the 70,000-seat stadium were handling dogs trained to sniff for explosive devices. They encircled cars entering the dome's parking garage and in some cases sniffed bags and backpacks.</p><p>The game, originally scheduled for 7:45 p.m. CST on Wednesday, was pushed back to 3 p.m. Thursday, about 36 hours after the attack. It was the first time the Sugar Bowl had been postponed in its 91-year history, although it was relocated at the end of the 2005 season because of Hurricane Katrina.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>The Superdome also is scheduled to host <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2025-super-bowl-halftime-show-kendrick-lamar-9631e4cb123a15567f29055c7de9e9d1">the Super Bowl</a> on Feb. 9.</p><p>Notre Dame advanced to the Orange Bowl next Thursday against <a href="https://apnews.com/article/penn-state-boise-state-playoff-fiesta-bowl-986c53b8f96be37f68425651e5703566">Fiesta Bowl winner Penn State</a>. </p><p>Mark Oldani, a 58-year-old Nashville resident and 1988 graduate of Notre Dame, took a group photo for a gathering of Georgia fans in front of the venue.</p><p>The crowd was “friendly, nobody yelling back and forth at each other,” he said. “I think everybody's coming in hoping for a good game and wanting to make the most of a really difficult situation.”</p><p>Before the singing of the national anthem, a moment of silence, lasting close to half a minute, was held.</p><p>While many fans extended their stay to attend the game, the postponement meant some were able to attend because of travel plans that were deemed too expensive or logistically difficult to change.</p><p>Numerous tickets were listed for resale online at prices as low as $23.</p><p>Postponing the game “was absolutely the right call,” said Lisa Borrelli, a 34-year-old Philadelphia resident who came to New Orleans with her fiance, a 2011 Notre Dame graduate, but could not stay for the game.</p><p>She said they paid more than $250 per ticket and weren't sure if they'd bother listing them for resale because prices were so low.</p><p>“Of course we’re disappointed to miss it and to lose so much money on it, but at the end of the day it doesn’t matter,” Borrelli said. “We’re fortunate enough that we’ll be fine.”</p><p>___</p><p>Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

This was the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/shootings-montenegro-7762091b6e9d8f6cc004432cd5557faf?utm_source=copy&amp;utm_medium=share">second such incident in the town</a> in the past three years. </p><p>Hundreds gathered on Thursday evening at the main square in Cetinje for a candlelight vigil in the memory of the victims.</p><p>Police Commissioner Lazar Šćepanović described Wednesday’s shooting as “one of the biggest tragedies in the history of Montenegro.”</p><p>He said at a news conference that the victims included seven men, three women and two children, born in 2011 and 2016.</p><p>“Most of the victims were people he knew, his closest friends and relatives,” including the shooter’s sister, Šćepanović said. “This criminal act wasn’t planned or organized. It was unpredictable.”</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><div class='taboola_readmore' data='autoembed'></div><p>The shooter, identified as 45-year-old Aco Martinović, killed the owner of the bar, the bar owner's children and his own family members, officials have said. </p><p>The attacker, who first fled after the rampage, was later located and surrounded by police. He died after shooting himself in the head, police said. </p><p>Residents of Cetinje, a town of some 17,000 people, were stunned and grief-stricken. </p><p>"I knew all of these people personally, also the attacker. I think when he did that, he was out of his mind," said Vesko Milošević, a retiree from Cetnje. "What do I know, he went from place to place and killed people. Its a catastrophe.”</p><p>Vanja Popović, whose relatives are among the victims, said that “we are all in shock.”</p><p>“How can I feel after this?" Popović said. "No one expected it. You can’t even ask anyone anything.”</p><p>Police had dispatched a special unit to search for the attacker in the town, which is located about 30 kilometers (18 miles) northwest of Podgorica, the country's capital. All roads in and out of Cetinje were blocked for hours as police swarmed the streets. </p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>Police said that the shooter had died while being taken to a hospital in the capital and succumbed from the “severity of his injuries.”</p><p>Officials have said that the attacker was at the bar throughout the day with other guests when the brawl erupted. He then went home, brought back a weapon and opened fire at around 5:30 p.m. </p><p>Prosecutor Andrijana Nastić said Thursday that the attacker went to six locations during the shooting rampage, including the last one, where he shot himself. </p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>Four men were killed at the bar, she said. The shooter then moved on to another location where he killed four more people, and then two children at a third site. He then went on to kill two more people at two other locations before eventually shooting himself, Nastić said. </p><p>“Further investigation will determine the exact circumstances of the events,” she added. </p><p>The government has declared three days of national mourning starting on Thursday, and all planned New Year's festivities have been canceled throughout the country. </p><p>Prime Minister Milojko Spajić said that the government may try to impose a total ban on weapons “because we must ask ourselves after this who should be allowed to have guns in Montenegro.”</p><p>The small Adriatic Sea nation, which has a population of around 620,000 people, is known for its gun culture and many people traditionally have weapons. </p><p>In August 2022 in Cetinje, which is Montenegro’s historic capital, an attacker killed 10 people, including two children, before he was shot and killed by a passerby.</p><p>Police have said that the suspect in Wednesday's shooting received a suspended sentence in 2005 for violent behavior and had appealed his latest conviction for illegal weapons possession. Montenegrin media have reported that he was known for erratic and violent behavior.</p><p>“Instead of holiday joy ... we have been gripped by sadness over the loss of innocent lives,” Montenegro's President Jakov Milatović said in a post on X.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writers Jovana Gec and Dušan Stojanović contributed to this report from Belgrade, Serbia.</p>

The first postponement of a Sugar Bowl in the event's 91-year history followed hours later.</p><p>“We spent some time together, and I think that’s what you do in tough moments,” Freeman said in recounting how the Irish handled their unexpected down time on Wednesday. “You want to spend time with family, and that’s what we are.”</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><div class='taboola_readmore' data='autoembed'></div><div id='afs:Card:534267443022' class='hub-peek-embed' content-id='53413cf35e62b2f4ea486d512cc1f4e7'>Hub peek embed (Collegefootball) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Notre Dame (13-1, CFP No. 5) came through with enough big plays, avoided major mistakes and all but sealed it with a clever move by Freeman.</p><p>“Our coaches called the game aggressive. Our players executed, put everything on the line,” Freeman said. “I’m really proud of them. Proud of the way they handled the events of the last 24 hours.”</p><p>Georgia (11-3, CFP No. 2) was in position to close within one score when Notre Dame stopped the Bulldogs on fourth-and-5 from the Irish 9-yard line with 9:29 to go.</p><p>Minutes later, Notre Dame had a fourth-and-short deep in his own territory when Freeman sent the punt team out before running all 11 players off the field and sending the offense back out. Georgia raced to match up and then jumped offside as the play clock ticked down, giving the Irish a clock-sapping first down with 7:17 to go.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>“They were going to hard-count us. We prepare for that. We do it every week,” Georgia coach Kirby Smart said. “We jumped offsides.”</p><p>By the time the Bulldogs got the ball back, just 1:49 remained, and Notre Dame was on its way to a 12th straight victory and a date with No. 5 Penn State (13-2, CFP No. 6 seed) in a semifinal at the Orange Bowl in Miami next Thursday.</p><p>“That’s the aggressiveness in terms of our preparation that I want our program to have,” Freeman said. “That’s got to be one of our edges, that we are going to be an aggressive group and not fear making mistakes.”</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>Georgia played without starting quarterback Carson Beck, who injured his elbow in the Southeastern Conference championship game. He was replaced by Gunner Stockton, who was 20 of 32 for 234 yards and one touchdown.</p><p>The Bulldogs outgained Notre Dame 296 yards to 244, but Georgia was stopped on all three of its fourth-down attempts and lost two fumbles — one deep in Notre Dame territory and one inside its own 20.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>“The turnovers are the difference in the game, guys,” Smart said. “I mean, you should know when you turn it over twice and they return a kickoff for a touchdown, you’re not going to have a lot of success.”</p><p>Leonard finished with 90 yards passing and a team-high 80 yards rushing, including a late first-down run in which he was sent head over heels as he tried to leap over a defender.</p><p>“We’re in the playoffs,” Leonard said. “Everybody else can put their body on the line, I’m going to do it right there with them.”</p><p>The game had been set for Wednesday night as part of a New Year's Day playoff tripleheader, but it was postponed after an Army veteran inspired by the Islamic State group drove a pickup truck into a crowd on Bourbon Street early Wednesday morning, killing 14 revelers. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/sugar-bowl-bourbon-attack-security-cfp-d6142ce05560f597c65dd99846e8ac4e">Security was increased at the Superdome</a> — which will also host the Super Bowl next month — and arriving fans said they felt safe.</p><p>With some fans unable to alter their travel plans, attendance in the 70,000-seat stadium was announced at 68,400. There were patches of empty seats in the upper levels, but passionate supporters made no shortage of noise trying to will their teams into the next round of college football's first 12-team playoff.</p><p>The game was tied at 3-all before Notre Dame scored 17 points in a span of 54 seconds.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>The unusual sequence began with Mitch Jeter’s 48-yard field goal with 39 seconds left in first half.</p><p>Soon after, Georgia paid for a decision to attempt a drop-back pass from its own 25. RJ Oben’s blind-side sack caused Stockton to fumble at the 13, where Irish defensive lineman Junior Tuihalamaka recovered.

Officials later said he <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-hotel-explosion-tesla-cybertruck-5c5a8fd13a50e2bcde46370ae926d427">suffered a gunshot wound to the head</a> before the explosion.</p><p>Turo said it is “shocked and saddened" Wednesday's events and that “our hearts are with the victims and their families." </p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><div class='taboola_readmore' data='autoembed'></div><div id='afs:Card:125415920973' class='hub-peek-embed' content-id='1a8d5f5bb8dcdeed32e17a5efe4296af'>Hub peek embed (apf-technology) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>The company added that is "outraged by the misuse of our marketplace by the two individuals who perpetrated these acts.”</p><p>While both incidents involved vehicles rented through Turo, the FBI has <a href="https://apnews.com/live/new-orleans-truck-attack-updates?user_email=862ba03288565eade925dd89c0c399e2fc71fbcd01825c81cdea469f16c9511c&amp;utm_medium=APNews_Alerts&amp;utm_source=Sailthru_AP&amp;utm_campaign=NewsAlert_Jan02_2025_11:52AM&amp;utm_term=AP%20News%20Alerts">said</a> that is has found “no definitive link” between the New Orleans attack and the Las Vegas explosion.</p><p>Still, the incidents have put a spotlight on the car-sharing platform. Here's what we know about Turo.</p><p><hl2>What is Turo?</hl2></p><p>Turo is a peer-to-peer car-sharing company. The online platform allows car owners to rent their own vehicles directly to other nearby drivers, or “guests.” “Hosts” set their prices, availability and delivery options for renters to choose from and book via Turo's website or app.</p><p>Billing itself as “the world’s largest car sharing marketplace" today, Turo says it operates through a network of hosts across the U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia and France. </p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>The origins of the San Francisco-based company date back almost 15 years, with its <a href="https://turo.com/blog/news/celebrating-10-years-of-turo/">first trip</a> completed in May 2010 and nationwide launch later arriving in 2012. The platform was originally introduced as “RelayRides,” but rebranded to Turo in 2015.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>Over the last 12 years of operating history, Turo says it collected data from over 90 million booked days, 27 million trips, 8.6 billion miles (13.8 billion kilometers) driven as of Sept. 30, 2024. Less than 0.1% of those Turo trips ended with a serious incident such as a vehicle theft, the company said Thursday.</p><p><hl2>How was Turo used for the cars involved in these New Year's Day events?</hl2></p><p>Again, investigators have not found any definitive connections between Wednesday's attack in New Orleans attack and following explosion in Las Vegas. But both incidents involved vehicles rented on Turo. </p><p>Authorities have said that the Cybertruck involved in the Las Vegas explosion was rented through the Turo app in Colorado. Kevin McMahill, the elected sheriff of Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-hotel-explosion-tesla-cybertruck-5c5a8fd13a50e2bcde46370ae926d427">said Wednesday</a> that authorities knew who rented this truck, but were not releasing the name until investigators determine if it is the same person who died.</p><p>On Wednesday, Turo <a href="https://x.com/turo/status/1874646846062186994">confirmed</a> that both the Cybertruck and the pickup truck used in the New Orleans attack were rented using the platform.</p><p><hl2>What else has the company said?</hl2></p><p>Turo has said it's sharing any information it has with law enforcement as investigations continue. The company has also noted that the individuals involved did not have criminal backgrounds that would have identified them as security threats. It said every Turo renter is screened through a "multi-layer, data-science-based trust and safety process.”</p><p>The men involved in the incidents had valid driver’s licenses, clean background checks, and were honorably discharged from the U.S. military, Turo noted Thursday.</p><p>“They could have boarded any plane, checked into a hotel, or rented a car or truck from a traditional vehicle rental chain,” the company said. "We do not believe these two individuals would have been flagged by anyone — including Big Rental or law enforcement.”</p>
