Qualified players should ensure that the email address associated to their Wizards Account—the account system used to log in to <em>MTG Arena</em>—is active and up to date.</p>  <h2>Qualifier Weekend Structure</h2> <p>The Qualifier Weekend takes place as a special event in <em>MTG Arena</em>. Players who have the Qualifier Token in their account will see the event and will be eligible to compete in one course of it during Day One. Both days of competition are Best-of-Three with sideboarding.</p>  <h3>General Structure—Day One</h3> <p>For Constructed formats, the event will allow a player to select their deck prior to any match play, but once a deck is chosen, it cannot be changed for the remainder of the Day One event.</p> <p>For Phantom Sealed formats, players will have access to six Limited packs of the corresponding <em>Magic</em> set and must build a deck with a minimum of 40 cards. Other cards that were opened and available in the sealed pool will be available in that player's sideboard between games of each Best-of-Three match. Additionally, players may modify their 40-card deck between matches during this event after initially submitting a deck. Cards opened will not be added to players' collections.</p> <p>For Phantom Draft formats, players will draft anonymously within the Traditional Draft queue and must build a deck with a minimum of 40 cards. Other cards that were drafted will be available in that player's sideboard between games of each Best-of-Three match. Additionally, players may modify their main deck between matches during this event. After each match completes, each player's deck will be automatically de-sideboarded by the game client. Cards opened will not be added to players' collections.</p>  <h3>Day One Entry Window</h3> <p>Players will be able to join the event on Day One no earlier than Saturday at 6 a.m. PT and no later than 8 a.m. PT. Late entries cannot be accommodated. The entry window is in place to ensure lower matchmaking times and to permit players enough time to complete all Day One matches.</p> <p>Players can participate in Day One until they receive either seven match wins or three match losses. If a player earns seven match wins, an in-game notification will appear, and a Day Two Token will appear on the top-right corner of the player's in-client home screen.</p>  <h3>General Structure—Day Two</h3> <p>For Day Two, players will only be able to participate if they earned seven match wins on Day One or were directly invited to Day Two as mentioned above. Eligible players should receive a Day Two token that appears in the top-right corner of the home screen. That token will appear in eligible players' accounts by the Thursday prior to the Qualifier Weekend (for direct invitees) or as soon as the seven-win Day One course ends. Players who expect to be able to join Day Two but cannot do so should contact <a href="https://mtgarena-support.wizards.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000419612" target="_blank">Customer Support</a> for assistance.</p> <p>Due to the Day Two event being available to many fewer participants than Day One, competitors are strongly encouraged to complete all their games as soon as possible. As the event nears its completion, matchmaking times may take longer than normal.</p> <p>Players who are eligible to participate on Day Two can play in one course that ends when they receive either six match wins or two match losses.</p> <p>For Constructed formats, players are permitted to enter with the same deck as Day One (if applicable), the same deck but with changes, or a different deck. Once a player begins their Day Two course, no further deck changes are permitted.</p> <p>For Phantom Sealed formats, like Day One, players will have access to a new pool of six Limited packs of the corresponding <em>Magic</em> set and must build a deck with a minimum of 40 cards. Other cards that were opened and available in the sealed pool will be available in that player's sideboard between games of each Best-of-Three match. Additionally, players may modify their 40-card deck between matches during this event after initially submitting a deck. Cards opened will not be added to players' collections.</p> <p>For Phantom Draft formats, like Day One, players will draft a new deck anonymously within the Traditional Draft queue and must build a deck with a minimum of 40 cards. Other cards that were drafted will be available in that player's sideboard between games of each Best-of-Three match. Additionally, players may modify their main deck between matches during this event. After each match completes, each player's deck will be automatically de-sideboarded by the game client. Cards opened will not be added to players' collections.</p>  <h3>Day Two Entry Window</h3> <p>Players will be able to join the event on Day Two no earlier than Sunday at 6 a.m. PT and no later than 8 a.m. PT. Late entries cannot be accommodated. The entry window is in place to ensure lower matchmaking times and to permit players enough time to complete all Day Two matches.</p>  <h3>Match Play in <em>MTG </em><em>Arena</em></h3> <p>Players are expected to compete under the implemented rules for <em>MTG Arena</em>.</p> <p>Each player will have 30 minutes on their respective match clock that will count down whenever that player has priority. To see the clock, hover your cursor over the bottom-left corner of the screen beside your display name.</p> <p>If a player runs out of time on their clock before the current game finishes, they will lose the match regardless of the current board state.</p>  <h3>Disclaimers</h3> <p>Players who compete acknowledge that they have read the tournament rules and are competing on hardware that meets the <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgarena/faq" target="_blank">recommended hardware specifications</a> for running <em>Magic: The Gathering Arena</em>.</p> <p>It is not recommended that players compete in Arena Premier Play events on a mobile device or any platform in early access.

                <!-- Intentionally not escaping for html context -->
                <p>With the results of the latest Spotlight Series arriving on the heels of several high-profile Standard events, the conversation around the cards <auto-card>Vivi Ornitier</auto-card> and <auto-card>Agatha's Soul Cauldron</auto-card>, and speculations on "emergency" bans in Standard, we thought now would be a good time to check in.</p>  <p>First, we do think we got our banned and restricted announcement timing windows wrong during this part of the year. This is the first year we've tied these announcements to play seasons, and we don't think we gave ourselves quite the right windows. That has put additional strain on a few formats, including Standard, and we know that can pull some of the fun out of playing competitively.</p>  <p>To that end, we're going to be more aggressive next year with the number of banned and restricted announcement windows and the timing, adding more. We're still fiddling with that cadence, but our aim is to have one for each major set release (or close to that amount) to maintain a sense of predictability and avoid disruptions during play seasons. It's not always possible to have that particular cake and eat it too, but we hear loud and clear that we don't have enough windows of opportunity.</p>  <p>We're also going to <em>slightly</em> move up our previously announced banned and restricted announcement date from November 24 to November 10. This keeps the basic premise of not interfering with players who had planned their decks and travel for the Standard RCQ season while still moving up the announcement and giving players more time to prepare for the World Championships should something change.</p>  <p>What we're not going to do is create a previously unannounced emergency banning window in the middle of the RCQ season, though it's worth noting that we have seen the calls for it and discussed it. Ultimately, we opted to stick (more or less) to what we had said we'd do for a few reasons.</p>  <p>One: The aforementioned RCQ players who have taken the time, effort, and money to plan travel, assemble decks, and schedule time for tournaments. A surprise change to the format hurts them the most, and it undermines one of our clearly stated goals for these announcements: to provide players with the stability and knowledge to make deck choices for events.</p>  <p>Just a few years ago, we tried to give ourselves the flexibility to ban cards whenever we wanted by removing predetermined ban dates, sometimes giving notice, sometimes not. It was chaos and, in retrospect, the wrong move. Every weekend was filled with banning speculation, calls for bans happened weekly (even as formats shifted), and we very rarely got the timing right. We're not doing that again. We want players and tournament organizers to be able to make plans around our announcement timings.</p> <p>Two: We believe that we will likely take action in November. <auto-card>Vivi Ornitier</auto-card> is warping the Standard format and likely needs to go. We're unsure about <auto-card>Agatha's Soul Cauldron</auto-card>. But we also don't think the format has reached its final form, which would give us the clearest direction to set Standard up for long-term success.</p>  <p>What do I mean by that?</p>  <p>Here's what we see right now. Vivi Cauldron decks have taken the spotlight with disproportionate metagame shares and top finishes. But recently, players have found a version of Mono-Red that is rebalancing the scales. Not only is it more played on the <em>MTG Arena</em> ladder, but it has a better win percentage against the field and is knocking off Vivi Cauldron decks at a clip above 60%. We're also seeing new decks (like the 2nd-place <a href="https://www.mtgo.com/decklist/standard-challenge-32-2025-09-0512813541" target="_blank">Mono-Green Stompy</a> deck from this <em>Magic Online</em> Challenge) that have promising win percentages but lower play rates. Despite the top finishes of the Vivi Cauldron deck, it's entirely possible Mono-Red is the best deck in the format and that there's further evolution coming.</p>  <p><auto-card>Vivi Ornitier</auto-card> is a clear outlier, but the format hasn't reached an equilibrium point yet.</p>  <p>Three: We believe Standard play may be hurt in the short term by one or two dominant decks. Long term, it is certainly hurt by banning decks out from under players in a surprise move. We want players to have as much confidence as possible in their ability to put a deck together and play it for as long as possible. That's why we moved to three-year Standard and why we try to minimize bans where possible.</p>  <p>This is a good place to add that our philosophy on Standard bans hasn't changed. Our intention is to make changes to the format once a year around rotation, unless we have what constitutes an emergency (we call it a "<auto-card face="https://gatherer-static.wizards.com/Cards/medium/A37550DF324EDA4D153F5C2E966717A07E8699E8ED270D6F3B8EC6016E4BF485.webp">Felidar</auto-card>" situation internally). We do think we are likely at that point, but it's good to keep in mind that we consider an emergency situation to be an instance where we ban a card during a window other than the yearly rotation window, not one where we would go off schedule.</p>  <p>Fourth and finally: While we acknowledge that high-level competitive Standard is lopsided, the majority of Standard play is not. The <em>MTG Arena</em> ladder isn't nearly this distorted, and in-store play isn't nearly this distorted. Most players who play Standard outside the competitive sphere have a different experience. Now, that said, there's a balance to be struck between "things are fine with most play" and "things are unstable with high-level competitive play" that we haven't currently hit. But when we make ban decisions, we make them for the entire ecosystem. High-level play gets the headlines and clicks, but the everyday experience is also important.</p>  <p>This means that the flip side of the current story could also be true—high-level play can appear balanced, but we may take action if everyday play isn't fun or engaging. That's not the current situation, but it's something to keep in mind for larger conversations around a format.</p>  <p>Before we go, I will note that we've focused mostly on Standard here, but November 10's announcement will encapsulate all the usual formats we talk about in our updates.</p>  <p>So, our next banned and restricted announcement will be on November 10. We'll be watching closely to see how Standard develops, but we're prepared to take action given the current state of the format. Until then, we hope everyone battling in Standard RCQs, at local events, and on digital platforms enjoys their time gaming.</p>

Welcome to <i>Arena Cube</i>, September 2025 edition! <i>Arena Cube</i> is a fan-favorite experience that we're always excited to feature, and we've once again got some sizeable changes this time.</p>  <p>Cube is like Booster Draft but pulls cards from across <i>Magic</i>'s history. There are all sorts of permutations of cubes, from high powered to rarity restricted, special rules to color restricted, and many, many more flavors. <i>Arena Cube</i> is a powerful, classic Cube experience:</p>  <ol> <li><b>High Powered</b>. <i>Arena Cube</i> uses many of the most powerful cards available on <i>MTG Arena</i>.</li> <li><b>Fast</b>. Many of the strongest cards on <i>MTG Arena</i> are cheap, which means you need to have a plan either to be aggressive or to answer aggression. Accordingly, this cube is lower on synergies, combos, and giant plays more frequently seen in another of our Cube events, like <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/mtg-arena/chromatic-cube-draft-mtg-arena" target="_blank"><i>Chromatic Cube</i></a>.</li> <li><b><i>Mostly</i> Singleton*</b>. <i>Arena Cube</i> contains exactly 540 cards with only one copy of each <i>nonland card</i>. There are three copies of each fetch land and two copies of each shock land.</li> <li><b>Phantom</b>. In tabletop, a cube is lent out to players who return the cards at the end of the draft, and the same is true here. Cards are not added to a player's collection.</li> </ol>  <div style="text-align: center;"> <magic-cards config="fan"> <magic-card face="https://media.wizards.com/2025/tdm/en_33f7c3a5b1.webp">Adeline, Resplendent Cathar</magic-card> <magic-card face="https://media.wizards.com/2023/lci/en_206a087d30.png">Inti, Senschal of the Sun</magic-card>   <magic-card face="https://media.wizards.com/2024/fdn/KJcVGY55Z3Bgi7/en_0ba6fe138d.png">Lotus Cobra</magic-card> <magic-card face="https://media.wizards.com/2022/dmu/en_HNF5Jq18tK.png">Sheoldred, the Apocalypse</magic-card> <magic-card face="http://media.wizards.com/2016/bVvMNuiu2i_KLD/en_7imxJLicMd.png">Smuggler's Copter</magic-card> <magic-card face="https://media.wizards.com/2024/inr/ZL7CP7UBj6fh/en_9baa5481c0.png">Snapcaster Mage</magic-card> </magic-cards> </div>  <h2><i>Arena Cube</i> Event Details</h2> <ul style="list-style-type: none;"> <li><b>Event Open</b>: September 9, 8 a.m. PT (15:00 UTC)</li> <li><b>Signup Close</b>:  September 23, 7 a.m. PT (15:00 UTC)</li> <li><b>Entry</b>: 4,000 gold or 600 gems</li> <li><b>Format</b>: <i>Arena Cube</i> Phantom Player Draft</li> <li><b>Structure</b>: <ul style="margin-bottom: 0;"><li><b>Best-of-One</b>: Seven wins or three losses</li> <li><b>Best-of-Three</b>: Three matches</li> </ul></li> <li><b>Rewards</b>: Historic individual card rewards (ICRs) not in Standard</li> </ul>  <div style="text-align: center; margin-top: -20px;"> <div style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: top; width: 49%; font-size: smaller; min-width: 320px;"> <table> <thead> <tr> <th style="background: black; color: white;" colspan="3"> <h2><i>Arena Cube</i> Best-of-One</h2> </th> </tr> <tr style="background: lightgray;"> <th>Wins</th> <th>Gold</th> <th>Individual Card Rewards (ICRs)</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody style="text-align: center;"> <tr> <td style="width: 20%;">7 Wins</td> <td>6,000 gold</td> <td>At least 2 rare and 1 uncommon Historic ICRs</td> </tr> <tr> <td>6 Wins</td> <td>5,000 gold</td> <td>At least 2 rare and 1 uncommon Historic ICRs</td> </tr> <tr> <td>5 Wins</td> <td>4,000 gold</td> <td>At least 2 rare and 1 uncommon Historic ICRs</td> </tr> <tr> <td>4 Wins</td> <td>3,000 gold</td> <td>At least 1 rare and 2 uncommon Historic ICRs</td> </tr> <tr> <td>3 Wins</td> <td>2,000 gold</td> <td>At least 1 rare and 2 uncommon Historic ICRs</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2 Wins</td> <td>1,000 gold</td> <td>At least 1 rare and 2 uncommon Historic ICRs</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1 Win</td> <td>500 gold</td> <td>At least 1 rare and 2 uncommon Historic ICRs</td> </tr> <tr> <td>0 Wins</td> <td>–</td> <td>At least 1 rare and 2 uncommon Historic ICRs</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div>  <div style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: top; width: 49%; font-size: smaller; min-width: 320px;"> <table> <thead> <tr> <th style="background: black; color: white;" colspan="3"> <h2><i>Arena Cube</i> Best-of-Three</h2> </th> </tr> <tr style="background: lightgray;"> <th>Wins</th> <th>Gold</th> <th>Individual Card Rewards (ICRs)</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody style="text-align: center;"> <tr> <td style="width: 20%;">3 Wins</td> <td>6,000 gold</td> <td>At least 2 rare and 1 uncommon Historic ICRs</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2 Wins</td> <td>4,000 gold</td> <td>At least 1 rare and 2 uncommon Historic ICRs</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1 Wins</td> <td>–</td> <td>At least 1 rare and 2 uncommon Historic ICRs</td> </tr> <tr> <td>0 Wins</td> <td>–</td> <td>At least 1 rare and 2 uncommon Historic ICRs</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> </div>  <hr>  <h2>A Moderate Adsjustment to A Moderate Experiment</h2>  <div class="rtecenter">  <img alt="" src="https://media.wizards.com/2025/images/daily/CtaqNA2Uz8.jpg"/> </div> <div style="text-align: right; margin: -10px 0 25px 0; font-size: smaller;">Art by: <a href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/search?artistName=eq~Sam_Guay" target="_blank">Sam Guay</a> </div>  <p>Last time, we tried out something bigger by radically reshaping <i>Arena Cube</i>'s mana base. Instead of being a full Singleton cube, we switched it to a Baltimore Singleton cube, meaning nonland cards only appear once but land cards appear multiple times. We included three copies of each fetch land and two copies of each shock land, with the explicit goal of encouraging more colorful decks and empowering cards like <auto-card face="https://gatherer-static.wizards.com/Cards/medium/A99D635C3607C040D128E292BCAEF52F20C55F81D4D7425CA480BBD16B9EF5ED.webp">Brainstorm</auto-card> and <auto-card>Lotus Cobra</auto-card>. While this experiment likely isn't a permanent change, we were happy with how the first iteration went and are running it back with some significant tweaks.</p>  <p>As usual, we are testing out plenty of cards that have been added to <i>MTG Arena</i> since we last ran <i>Arena Cube</i>. This includes demonstrated power outliers like Cori-Steel Cutter and Stock Up that have come through recent Standard-legal releases, powerful additions from Arena Anthologies like <auto-card>Grist, the Hunger Tide</auto-card> and <auto-card>Mana Leak</auto-card>, and a few more oddball candidates that benefit from the preponderance of fetch lands, like <auto-card>Tannuk, Memorial Ensign</auto-card> and <auto-card>Hydroponics Architect</auto-card>.</p>  <div style="text-align: center; width: 100%;"> <div style="width: 265px; height: 370px; display: inline-block; vertical-align: top;"> <img style="position: relative;" alt="Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer" src="https://media.wizards.com/2021/mh2/en_t8Zry6Y7UM.png"> <img style="position: relative; z-index: 2; bottom: 350px;" alt="Red cross-out mark" src="https://media.wizards.com/2023/images/daily/redx.png"> </div> </div> <br>  <p>Perhaps the biggest change this time around isn't about what's <i>in</i> the list, but what <i>isn't</i>. Over the past few iterations of <i>Arena Cube</i>, red-based aggressive decks—particularly red-white ones—have consistently dominated. In general, it's great for aggro to be the top dog. It means games play out on the battlefield, interaction matters, and the average game or match doesn't take long. To show my hand a bit, I love slow, controlling decks. Therefore, I make an active effort to ensure aggro is strong to counter my unconscious and conscious biases.</p>  <p>With that said, there's a limit to how good any one deck ought to be. If red aggro is too strong, then entire archetypes and colors struggle to compete. Getting to be on the play, which is outside of a player's control, becomes too large a determinant in who wins. The possibility space of the cube shrinks when red cards push you to play one style of gameplay and not playing red cards puts you at a disadvantage. We will <i>want</i> aggro to be strong—we <i>are</i> adding cards like <auto-card>Voice of Victory</auto-card> and <auto-card>Cori-Steel Cutter</auto-card>—but we're removing cards like <auto-card>Ocelot Pride</auto-card>; <auto-card>Ajani, Nacatl Pariah</auto-card>; <auto-card>Phlage, Titan of Fire's Fury</auto-card>; <auto-card>Fable of the Mirror-Breaker</auto-card>; and the mighty <auto-card>Goblin Bombardment</auto-card> (a card that's often picked late but has the second-highest win rate of the cube), along with some non-red-white outliers like <auto-card>Psychic Frog</auto-card>. These join <auto-card face="https://gatherer-static.wizards.com/Cards/medium/EB4FE8998CC4340148F8FFD0B78C728EEDDDF370D9D05E819FEAEA5A5E5FF4B7.webp">Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer</auto-card>; <auto-card>Solitude</auto-card>; and <auto-card>Mana Drain</auto-card> as cards that are more powerful than we can currently handle in <i>Arena Cube</i>.</p>  <h3>The September 2025 <i>Arena Cube</i></h3>  <p>I hope these changes will bring the cube a bit more into balance, allowing red-white to be strong without overly defining the entire play space. We want to see what players do with the high density of fixing when under slightly less pressure to interact every turn of the game. And as always, we'll try something new next time. Most importantly, we hope that you have fun playing this iteration of <i>Arena Cube</i>. We look forward to seeing you share your decklists, stories, experiences, and feelings on the experimental mana base. See you in the queues!</p>  <h2 id="cardlists" style="scroll-margin-top: 70px;"><i>Arena Cube</i> Card Lists</h2> <p>The following lists contain all cards in <i>Arena Cube</i> broken down by color.</p>  <!-- CARD LISTS --> <!-- WHITE --> <div class="collapsibleBlock"> <dl class="showHideListItems"> <dt> <div style="text-align: center;
