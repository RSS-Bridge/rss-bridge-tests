                <p>The United States said on Tuesday that 104% duties on imports from China will take effect shortly after midnight, even as the Trump administration moved to quickly start talks with other trading partners targeted by President Donald Trump's sweeping tariff plan.</p><p>U.S. stocks retreated on the news. Global markets had previously posted gains on hopes that Trump might be willing to negotiate down the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/tariffs/">array of country and product-specific trade barriers</a> he is erecting around the world's largest consumer market.</p><p>The administration has scheduled talks with <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-korea-trade-minister-says-considering-measures-boost-us-imports-2025-04-08/">South Korea</a> and Japan, two close allies and major trading partners, and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is due to visit next week.</p><p>But the White House made clear that country-specific tariffs of up to 50% would nevertheless take effect at 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time (0401 GMT), as planned.</p><p>Those tariffs will be especially steep for China, as Trump has ratcheted up duties on its imports to 104% in response to counter-tariffs Beijing announced last week. China has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/donald-trump/china-rejects-us-blackmail-markets-steadier-2025-04-08/">refused to bow</a> to what it called "blackmail" and has vowed to "fight to the end."</p><p>Administration officials said they would not prioritize negotiations with the world's No. 2 economic power.</p><p>Trump's sweeping tariffs have raised fears of recession and upended a global trading order that has been in place for decades.</p><p>"Right now, we've received the instruction to prioritize our allies and our trading partners like Japan and Korea and others," White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said on Fox News.</p><p>The White House said Trump instructed his trade team to create "tailor made" deals for the nearly 70 countries that have reached out for talks.</p><p>Trump's lead trade negotiator, Jamieson Greer, told Congress that his office is trying to work quickly but is not facing a particular deadline.</p><p>"The president has been clear, again, that he's not doing exemptions or exceptions in the near term," Greer told lawmakers.</p><p>China is bracing for a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/limited-options-push-china-into-trade-war-attrition-with-trump-2025-04-08/">war of attrition</a>, and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/its-like-throwing-darts-blindfolded-tariffs-take-toll-chinese-exporters-2025-04-08/">manufacturers</a> are warning about profits and scrambling to plan new overseas plants. Citing rising external risks, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/citi-cuts-china-gdp-growth-forecast-42-47-2025-2025-04-08/">Citi cut</a> its 2025 China GDP growth forecast to 4.2% from 4.7%.</p><p>Three out of four Americans expect prices to rise as Trump's tariffs kick in, according to a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/73-americans-expect-price-surge-under-trump-tariffs-reutersipsos-poll-finds-2025-04-08/">Reuters/Ipsos poll</a>.</p><p>Chipmaker Micron <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/MU.O" target="_blank">(MU.O)</a> told customers it will impose a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/micron-impose-tariff-related-surcharge-some-products-april-9-sources-say-2025-04-08/">tariff-related surcharge</a> starting on Wednesday, while U.S. clothing retailers said they are <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/clothing-retailers-delay-orders-freeze-hiring-tariffs-hit-2025-04-08/">delaying orders</a> and holding off on hiring. Running shoes made in Vietnam that now retail for $155 will cost $220 when Trump's 46% tariff on that country takes effect, according to an industry group.</p><p>Consumers are <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/some-us-consumers-stockpile-goods-ahead-trumps-new-tariffs-2025-04-08/">stocking up</a> while they can. "I'm buying double of whatever - beans, canned goods, flour, you name it," Thomas Jennings, 53, said as he pushed a shopping cart through the aisles of a New Jersey Walmart <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/WMT.N" target="_blank">(WMT.N)</a>.</p><p>Stock markets found a firmer footing on Tuesday after a gut-wrenching few days for investors which prompted some business leaders, including those close to Trump, to urge the president to reverse course.</p><p>European shares bounced off 14-month lows after four straight sessions of heavy selling, while global <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/oil-prices-climb-1-after-heavy-us-tariff-driven-selloff-2025-04-08/">oil prices</a> steadied after falling to four-year lows.</p><p>Wall Street's main indexes had posted gains earlier in the day, but fell after the White House said the tariffs on China would take effect.</p><p>The European Commission, meanwhile, is mulling <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/eu-commission-proposes-25-counter-tariffs-some-us-imports-document-shows-2025-04-07/">counter-tariffs</a> of 25% on a range of U.S. goods including soybeans, nuts and sausages, though other potential items like bourbon whiskey were left off the list. Officials said they stood ready to negotiate.</p><p>The 27-member bloc is struggling with tariffs on autos and metals already in place, and faces a 20% tariff on other products on Wednesday. Trump has also threatened to impose tariffs on EU alcoholic drinks.</p><p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/drugmakers-warn-eu-that-us-tariffs-further-weaken-sector-europe-sources-say-2025-04-08/">European pharma companies</a>, also fearful of the tariff fallout, warned the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, in a meeting that Trump's tariffs would expedite the industry's shift away from Europe and towards the United States.</p>  <figure><img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/5YJ2UBGNOFJETGPZLSPA4BBJUY.jpg" alt="Gantry cranes stand near shipping containers at Yangshan Port outside of Shanghai"> 	 <figcaption style="text-align: center;"><i>Gantry cranes stand near shipping containers at Yangshan Port outside of Shanghai, China, February 7, 2025.

                <p>The U.S. State Department on Tuesday announced that American and Russian delegations will meet for a second time in Istanbul on April 10 to "solely" discuss stabilizing bilateral embassy operations.</p><p>Speaking at a daily press briefing, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said the discussions will not include any political or security issues.</p><p>"Ukraine is not, absolutely not on the agenda," Bruce said.</p><p>"These talks are solely focused on our embassy operations, not on normalizing a bilateral relationship overall, which can only happen, as we've noted, once there is peace between Russia and Ukraine," she added.</p><p>A diplomatic source earlier said the talks will take place at the Russian consulate in Istanbul.</p><p>In February, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/russian-delegation-arrives-talks-with-us-istanbul-2025-02-27/">Russian and U.S. teams</a> held talks in Istanbul to try to restore normal functioning of their embassies. The talks, focused narrowly on conditions for each other's diplomats, provided an early test of the two countries' ability to reset wider relations.</p><p>Russia and the United States have expelled diplomats and limited the appointment of new staff at each other's missions in tit-for-tat measures over the past decade, leaving their embassies thinly staffed.</p><p>Earlier on Tuesday, the Russian state-run TASS news agency reported that delegations from Russia and the U.S. would meet for consultations in Istanbul in the coming days, citing the Russian Foreign Ministry.</p><p>The Russian delegation will be led by Alexander Darchiev, recently appointed as Russia's ambassador to the U.S., while the U.S. delegation will be headed by Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Sonata Coulter, TASS reported.</p><p>Both delegations will be made up of only diplomats and the talks will focus on normalising the operations of the diplomatic missions of both countries, it quoted Russia's Foreign Ministry as saying.</p><p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/europe-says-it-is-committed-ukraine-ahead-russia-us-talks-2025-02-18/">U.S. and Russian officials</a> also met in February in the Saudi capital Riyadh to discuss how to end the war in Ukraine, part of a broader rapprochement with Moscow sought by the new Trump administration.</p>  <figure><img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/QGELAARLUVKENKOXYGAJAIRHNY.jpg" alt="Press briefing by Tammy Bruce at the State Department in Washington"> 	 <figcaption style="text-align: center;"><i>U.S. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce speaks during her first press briefing at the State Department in Washington, D.C., U.S., March 6, 2025.

                <p>Three American citizens jailed over a failed coup attempt in Democratic Republic of Congo were handed over to U.S. custody on Tuesday officials said, following high-level talks between the two countries on security and mining deals, the Congolese presidency told Reuters on Tuesday.</p><p>The presidency said the Americans had been transferred to U.S. authorities after their sentences were <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/congo-commutes-death-sentences-us-citizens-failed-coup-2025-04-02/">commuted</a> last week to serve their time at home.</p><p>The deal to hand over the Americans was finalised as U.S. President <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/donald-trump/">Donald Trump's</a> senior Africa adviser, Massad Boulos, traveled to Congo to hold meetings with President Felix Tshisekedi in the capital Kinshasa.</p><p>Their release comes at a time of intensifying negotiations between Washington and Kinshasa. The United States is open to exploring <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/us-open-minerals-partnerships-with-democratic-republic-congo-2025-03-09/">critical minerals partnerships</a>, the State Department told Reuters last month, after Congo pitched a minerals-for-security deal to the Trump administration.</p><p>Ahead of the trip, Trump's special envoy for hostage response had called on Tshisekedi to release the Americans.</p><p>‚ÄúThis shows that the collaboration and cooperation between the two states is growing stronger and stronger,‚Äù said Tina Salama, Tshisekedi's spokeswoman.</p><p>The White House and State Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Joseph Szlavik-Soto, a lobbyist working for Kinshasa, said the Congolese had also agreed to pay for the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/congo-protesters-attack-kinshasa-embassies-over-conflict-east-2025-01-28/">damage caused by protesters who attacked the U.S. embassy</a> and other missions earlier this year.</p><p>Congo wants the U.S. to play a bigger role in securing the war-ravaged country, where fighting in the east has raised fears of a wider regional conflict.</p><p>The violence has escalated since January, when Rwandan-backed M23 rebels made a swift advance, capturing the two largest cities in the east.</p><p>Washington is interested in securing greater access to Congo's minerals, which are used in mobile phones and electric cars, and are currently exploited predominantly by China and its mining companies.</p><p>The Trump administration hasn't said how it might provide security, but a former senior defense official said options could include providing troops or contractors to train Congolese forces.</p><p>"I hope it could work in a fashion that respects human rights and contributes to long-term stability in this important region. This will be very challenging in the DRC context," the official said.</p><p>The Americans were among 37 defendants in Congo <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/us-citizens-trial-role-congo-coup-attempt-sentenced-death-2024-09-13/">sentenced to death</a> by a military court in September.</p><p>The coup attempt last May was led by Christian Malanga, a U.S.-based Congolese politician, whose 22-year-old son was among the Americans arrested.</p><p>Marcel Malanga, who was visiting Congo with a high school friend, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/us-citizens-congo-coup-attempt-tell-court-they-were-forced-join-2024-07-05/">said at the trial</a> his father had threatened to kill them if they did not obey his orders. His mother did not respond to a request for comment sent on Facebook.</p>  <figure><img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/CEJTFWG3RFKOJJ2IZDAAKY6GQI.jpg" alt="19th Francophonie Summit in Paris"> 	 <figcaption style="text-align: center;"><i>Democratic Republic of the Congo's President Felix Tshisekedi arrives to attend the opening session of the 19th Summit of the Francophonie at the Grand Palais in Paris, France October 5, 2024.

                <p>The rise of right-wing populism in Europe and elsewhere should not prevent Africa from bringing reparations for transatlantic slavery and colonialism to the table, the head of the African Union's (AU) diaspora division said.</p><p>"There is no better time as this to discuss the issue of reparations as Africans ... irrespective of the various issues going on that may seem intimidating," the official, Angela Naa Afoley Odai, told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday.</p><p>Others, including the president of the African island nation of Cape Verde, Jose Maria Neves, previously said the growth of right-wing populism has made it difficult to hold a serious debate over reparations.</p><p>Neves <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/cape-verde-president-says-governments-must-discuss-colonial-reparations-2024-06-05/">said</a> debating the issue in the "public arena" could potentially lead to more political polarisation in European countries formerly involved in slavery and colonialism, such as Portugal, France and Britain.</p><p>While the issue of reparations has gained <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/slavery-tribunal-africa-caribbean-unite-reparations-2024-04-04/">momentum</a> worldwide, so has the backlash. U.S. President Donald Trump has said he "doesn't see it happening," and many of Europe's leaders have <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/british-lawmakers-accuse-starmer-colonial-mindset-slavery-reparations-debate-2024-10-27/">opposed</a> even talking about reparations.</p><p>African leaders <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/african-leaders-push-slavery-reparations-despite-resistance-2025-02-13/">launched</a> a new push for reparations in February, and say they will set out their own plan of what reparations may look like, from financial compensation and formal acknowledgement of past wrongs to policy reforms.</p><p>The AU said in a statement that reparations could involve "diplomatic pressure or legal actions at international courts".</p><p>Afoley Odai said diplomatic pressure would stem from the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/african-caribbean-nations-join-forces-call-reparations-slavery-2023-07-27/">work</a> the AU was doing, including with the Caribbean, to "build a united front" involving both those who live on the continent and the African diaspora.</p><p>She said ongoing links between the African Union and the European Union, from summits to partnerships, would be used to push for reparations.</p><p>Opponents of reparations argue, among other things, that contemporary states and institutions should not be held responsible for their past.</p><p>But <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/un-chief-calls-slavery-reparations-overcome-generations-discrimination-2024-03-25/">advocates</a> say action is needed to address the legacy of slavery and colonialism, such as systemic and structural racism, and say that contemporary states still benefit from the wealth generated by hundreds of years of exploitation.</p>  <figure><img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/QFWP2GFPJZN2NAOTTPCDYHBNRY.jpg" alt="African Union member states Heads of State gather at the headquarters for the Annual Summit in Addis Ababa"> 	 <figcaption style="text-align: center;"><i>A delegate walks next to African Union (AU) member states flags ahead of the 38th Ordinary Session of the Heads of State and Government of the African Union at the African Union Commission (AUC) headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, February 14, 2025.

                <p>The United States will take back the Panama Canal from Chinese influence, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Tuesday during a visit to the Central American nation.</p><p>Hegseth, following talks with Panama's government, vowed to deepen security cooperation with Panama's forces and said China would not be allowed to "weaponize" the canal by using Chinese firms' commercial relationships for espionage.</p><p>"Together, we will take back the Panama Canal from China's influence," Hegseth said, speaking at a pier renovated with U.S. assistance in Panama City.</p><p>"China did not build this canal. China does not operate this canal and China will not weaponize this canal. Together with Panama in the lead, we will keep the canal secure and available for all nations."</p><p>More than 40% of U.S. container traffic, valued at roughly $270 billion a year, goes through the Panama Canal, accounting for more than two-thirds of vessels passing each day through the world's second-busiest interoceanic waterway.</p><p>Hegseth is expected to get a close-up look at the Panama Canal later on Tuesday, the first full day of a rare visit to a nation still unsettled by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/donald-trump/">Trump</a>'s threats to take back the canal.</p><p>While Hegseth spoke about removing Chinese influence, Trump has spoken in broader terms and not ruled out using military force, if necessary.</p><p>Hegseth is the first U.S. defense secretary to visit in decades, and his trip follows reports that the Trump administration has requested options from the U.S. military to ensure access to the canal, which the United States built more than a century ago and handed over to Panama in 1999.</p><p>Trump has complained that was a bad deal for the United States.</p><p>Hegseth was greeted by Panama Public Security Minister Frank Abrego and held closed-door meetings with President Jose Raul Mulino and other officials.</p><p>Given Trump's tough rhetoric, the stakes are high for Hegseth's visit.</p><p>"On the whole, this hasn't been a winning issue for the United States in terms of public diplomacy in Panama," said Ryan Berg, director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.</p><p>Still, current and former U.S. officials and experts say the United States has found a willing partner in tackling Chinese influence in Mulino.</p><p>In February, Mulino announced Panama's formal <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/rubio-hails-panamas-move-exit-chinese-infrastructure-plan-2025-02-03/">move to exit</a> China's Belt and Road Initiative and he has aided Trump's crackdown on migrants.</p><p>He has accepted deportation flights of non-Panamanians and worked to stem migration from South America by those crossing through his country's dangerous Darien jungle.</p><p>Hegseth praised Mulino, saying his government understood the threat from China, and his remarks about Panama being in the lead on addressing the canal's security concerns appeared to be a nod to Panamanian sensitivities.</p><p>Hegseth, a U.S. military veteran and former Fox News host, has enthusiastically backed Trump's southern-focused security agenda, by means such as dispatching U.S. troops to the U.S. border with Mexico and offering military aircraft for deportation flights.</p><p>Trump has falsely claimed that China is operating the canal, something even Hegseth said was not true on Tuesday, and that Chinese soldiers are present.</p><p>But experts acknowledge U.S. security concerns, particularly regarding espionage, with an expansive Chinese commercial presence in Panama that also includes plans by Chinese firms to build <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/senators-raise-concern-about-chinese-influence-panama-canal-operations-2025-01-29/">a bridge</a> over the canal.</p><p>Last month, Trump <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/ck-hutchison-shares-jump-22-after-panama-canal-stake-sale-blackrock-2025-03-05/">celebrated a deal</a> led by U.S. firm BlackRock to buy most of the $22.8-billion ports business of Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison, including its ports on either end of the Panama Canal.</p><p>Trump said the purchase was an example of how the United States was "reclaiming" the canal.</p><p>But China has criticized it, with the market regulator saying it will carry out an antitrust review of the deal.</p><p>Current and former U.S. officials say the Panama Canal would be critical for the passage of U.S. warships during any future conflict in Asia, since Navy vessels would transit from the Atlantic to the Pacific to support the war effort.</p><p>Even without blocking the canal, China could have an enormous advantage by being able to surveil vessels passing through it.</p><p>Still, John Feeley, who was U.S. ambassador to Panama from 2015 to 2018, disputed the Trump administration's assertion that China's presence in Panama was a violation of the U.S.-Panama treaty.</p><p>"What's not legitimate about the way Trump has gone about this is the bullying tactic that he's used, which is to claim that there has been a violation of the neutrality treaty. There hasn't been," Feeley said.</p><p>Mulino has defended Panama's administration of the canal, saying it has been handled responsibly for world trade, including that of the United States, and that it "is, and will continue to be, Panamanian."</p>  <figure><img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/V56RZ4QPGJIFTKLBM456QRTZVA.jpg" alt="U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth in Panama"> 	 <figcaption style="text-align: center;"><i>U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Panama's Minister of Public Security Frank Abrego shake hands, in Panama City, Panama April 8, 2025.

                <p>A top U.S. Senate Democrat pressed the FBI on Tuesday to explain why it reassigned staff from domestic terrorism investigations, accusing Republican <a href="https://www.reuters.com/topic/person/donald-trump/">President Donald Trump</a>‚Äôs administration of imperiling efforts to confront violent extremists in the U.S.</p><p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/fbi-scales-back-staffing-tracking-domestic-terrorism-probes-sources-say-2025-03-21/">Reuters reported</a> last month that the FBI transferred about 16 agents and intelligence analysts from its Domestic Terrorism Operations Section, which supports investigations run by the FBI‚Äôs 55 field offices and provides information on domestic threats.</p><p>The letter from Senator Dick Durbin, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, asked the FBI how many personnel remain in the section and how the agency is managing investigations previously assigned to its staff.</p><p>‚ÄúI strongly urge you to put the safety of the American people first, reverse these resource reallocations, and reaffirm the Administration‚Äôs commitment to tackling domestic violent extremism with the full force and attention this significant threat demands,‚Äù Durbin of Illinois wrote to FBI Director Kash Patel and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.</p><p>The move raised fears that investigations into violence fueled by white supremacist and anti-government ideologies may be a lower priority under Patel, who has criticized the FBI's past work on domestic terrorism.</p><p>An FBI spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Patel told the House Intelligence Committee last month that FBI counterterrorism staff "move all the time" and he was focused on reprioritizing the FBI to combat violent crime and national security threats.</p><p>Federal authorities have recently said they will treat arson attacks targeting Tesla as domestic terrorism. Tesla CEO Elon Musk is championing Trump‚Äôs overhaul of the federal government.</p><p>Durbin also asked for an explanation of Department of Homeland Security moves recently reported by the media. The Washington Post reported DHS has stopped funding a national database on domestic terrorism and hate crimes, and the investigative news outlet ProPublica reported that grants for violence prevention programs had been cut or frozen.</p><p>A spokesperson for DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>‚ÄúTaken together, these moves represent a broad institutional pullback from confronting the full scope of domestic terrorism threats,‚Äù Durbin wrote in the letter.</p>  <figure><img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/FDA7NNVHE5O5FH3KASHRHS3QT4.jpg" alt="Democrats hold hearing about the Trump administration's treatment of the Justice Department on Capitol Hill in Washington"> 	 <figcaption style="text-align: center;"><i>U.S. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) speaks during a hearing organized by Democrats in the House of Representatives and Senate about the Trump administration's treatment of the Justice Department and law firms who act in cases disliked by the Republican president, on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., April 7, 2025.

                <p>The United States "will have no patience for bad faith negotiation or violation of commitments" as it seeks to end the war in Ukraine, acting U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Dorothy Shea told the Security Council on Tuesday.</p><p>"We will ultimately judge President (Vladimir) Putin's commitment to a ceasefire by Russia's actions," Shea told the 15-member council.</p><p>The Security Council met after a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-kryvyi-rih-mourns-victims-russian-missile-strike-2025-04-07/">Russian missile attack</a> on the Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih last week killed 11 adults and nine children in one of the deadliest attacks on civilians in months, jeopardizing Washington's ceasefire push.</p><p>"We urge the Russian Federation to bear in mind that strikes like those on Kryvyi Rih, and executions of prisoners of war, have the potential to damage peace efforts and all dependent discussions," Shea said.</p><p>Russia said without providing evidence that Friday's strike had targeted a meeting of Ukrainian service members and foreign trainers and killed up to 85 of them, a claim rejected by Kyiv as disinformation.</p><p>Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia on Tuesday blamed the civilian deaths on a Ukrainian attempt to intercept the Russian attack.</p><p>He also reminded the Security Council that one of Moscow's long-stated goals was Ukrainian demilitarization, which it would achieve "using military or negotiating means in such a way to make sure that Ukraine is no longer a threat to Russia."</p><p>"We are ready to have a serious and practical dialogue, but we will not allow anyone to deceive us. We will not allow anyone to use this negotiating process in the interest of strengthening the Kyiv regime's military potential," Nebenzia said.</p><p>Ukraine's deputy U.N. Ambassador Khrystyna Hayovyshyn noted that Ukraine had accepted a U.S. proposal for a 30-day ceasefire.</p><p>"In response to this proposal, Russia targets Ukrainian cities and villages with drones, bombs, artillery and ballistic and cruise missile attacks," she told the council. "Russia demonstrates its complete disregard for international peace efforts led by the United States."</p>  <figure><img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/ZL2256544NNCJDQVU5SI73MY3E.jpg" alt="Funeral ceremony for Ukrainians killed during Russian missile strike in Kryvyi Rih"> 	 <figcaption style="text-align: center;"><i>Relatives and friends attend a funeral ceremony for two children, Alina Kutsenko, 15, and Danylo Nikitskyi, 15, who were killed in a Russian missile strike on Friday, April 4, as a result of which many people died, including children, and dozens people were injured, amid Russia's attack on Ukraine, in the town of Kryvyi Rih, Dnipropetrovsk region, Ukraine April 7, 2025.

                <p>Russia is close to regaining full control of its western Kursk region after pushing Ukrainian forces from one of their last footholds there, the regional governor and state media said on Tuesday.</p><p>Russia's Defence Ministry released video of what it said was the recapture of the settlement of Guyevo set to dramatic music, showing smoke rising into the air from various buildings, a soldier waving the Russian flag from the window of a heavily damaged Orthodox church, and Russian troops carrying out house-to-house checks in case any Ukrainian soldiers were hiding.</p><p>Reuters was able to verify the location of the video from file and satellite imagery of the area, but not the date.</p><p>There was no immediate comment on Russia's assertion from Ukraine, but the Ukrainian General Staff said in a statement that its planes had struck a complex of hangars and military buildings in the Kursk region being used by Russian drone operators and maintenance workers. Reuters was unable to verify the claim.</p><p>Russia has been trying to eject <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraine-russia-war/">Ukrainian forces</a> from Kursk since August last year after Kyiv's troops mounted a surprise incursion that embarrassed President Vladimir Putin and which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hoped would give him a bargaining chip in any future talks.</p><p>But Russia has retaken a swath of territory inside Kursk in recent weeks, pushing Ukrainian forces closer towards the border. It has also begun to take territory in Ukraine's neighbouring Sumy region after Putin spoke of the possibility of carving out a buffer zone.</p><p>Alexander Khinshtein, the governor of Kursk who was appointed by Putin in December, said the raising of Russia's flag in Guyevo meant Russian forces were on course to regain control of the region "very soon".</p><p>Citing an unnamed source in the military, the state TASS news agency said that Russian forces only had to push Ukrainian troops out of two more settlements - Gornal and Oleshnya - in order to retake the entire region.</p><p>The Defence Ministry said its forces had defeated Ukrainian troops in fighting around the two settlements, but suggested they remained under Ukrainian control. Reuters could not verify the battlefield claims.</p><p>Ukraine's authoritative DeepState war map shows Ukraine in control of about 58 square kilometres (22 square miles) of Russian territory in Kursk, down from as much as 1,400 square kilometres claimed by Kyiv last year.</p><p>Zelenskiy <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/zelenskiy-acknowledges-ukrainian-troops-were-present-russias-belgorod-region-2025-04-07/">confirmed for the first time</a> on Monday that Ukrainian troops have also been active in Russia's adjacent Belgorod region.</p><p>He said the aim of Ukrainian activity in Russia's border areas was to protect Ukraine's Sumy and Kharkiv regions from Russian aggression and said that "the war must return to where it came from".</p><p>Russia's war in Ukraine has left hundreds of thousands of dead and injured, displaced millions of people, reduced towns to rubble and triggered the sharpest confrontation for decades between Moscow and the West.</p><p>Russian commander Apti Alaudinov was quoted by the state RIA news agency as <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-commander-says-situation-belgorod-under-control-while-battles-continue-2025-04-04/">saying on Friday</a> that the situation in the Belgorod region was "under control" after the Ukrainian army tried to break through the border around two weeks ago.</p>  <figure><img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/BFW46S7HNBOAVDQVVRAG6PARVA.jpg" alt="Satellite image shows Sudzha border crossing in Oleshnya, Kursk Region"> 	 <figcaption style="text-align: center;"><i>A satellite image shows the Sudzha border crossing in Oleshnya, Kursk Region August 1, 2024 in this handout obtained August 8, 2024 by Reuters. 2024 Planet Labs Inc/Handout via REUTERS/File Photo</i></figcaption></figure>

Lift some sanctions or unfreeze some money," a regional diplomat said.</p><p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/kremlin-says-it-supports-direct-us-iran-talks-over-nuclear-program-2025-04-08/">Russia backs</a> either direct or indirect talks between Iran and the U.S. as a chance to de-escalate tensions, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday, adding: "We know that certain contacts, direct and indirect, are planned in Oman."</p><p>Russia's lower house of parliament also <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-lower-house-parliament-ratifies-20-year-pact-between-russia-iran-2025-04-08/">ratified</a> on Tuesday a 20-year strategic partnership with Iran, a sign of the deepening military ties between the two countries.</p><p>Efforts to settle a dispute over Iran's nuclear programme, which it says is purely for civilian use but which Western countries see as a precursor to an atomic bomb, have ebbed and flowed for <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/irans-tangled-nuclear-dispute-with-west-2025-04-08/">more than 20 years</a> without resolution.</p><p>Trump tore up a 2015 deal between Iran and six world powers - the U.S., Russia, China, France, Britain and Germany - during his first term of office in 2017 and talks since then have stalled.</p><p>With the Middle East aflame since 2023 with wars in Gaza and Lebanon, strikes in Yemen, exchanges of fire between Iran and Israel and regime change in Syria, Trump's warnings of military action have jangled nerves across the oil-exporting region.</p><p>In Tehran, Trump's warnings are seen as a way to box the Islamic Republic into accepting concessions in the talks Trump demands or face air strikes, three Iranian officials said.</p><p>They said the U.S. wanted to push other issues too, including Iranian influence across the Middle East and its ballistic missiles programme, which they said were off the table.</p><p>"Trump wants a new deal: end Iran's regional influence, dismantle its nuclear programme, and halt its missile work. These are unacceptable to Tehran. Our nuclear programme cannot be dismantled," a senior Iranian official said.</p><p>"Our defence is non-negotiable. How can Tehran disarm when Israel has nuclear warheads? Who protects us if Israel or others strike?" said another official.</p><p>Israel, which has long regarded Iran as its biggest regional threat, defeated Tehran's Lebanese ally Hezbollah last year and its prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, was with Trump on Monday when the U.S. president announced Saturday's talks.</p><p>Netanyahu, who has repeatedly urged U.S. governments to use strikes against Iran's nuclear programme, said a diplomatic solution would be good if it was done "in a full way", citing the complete dismantling of Libya's atomic programme.</p><p>"Let them drag out the talks and then the option is military. Everyone understands this," Netanyahu said on Tuesday in a statement.</p><p>Iran has pushed back against Trump's warnings of military action, saying it will not be cowed by threats.</p><p>The Islamic Republic has withstood repeated sanctions programmes over recent decades and Iranian military leaders have previously threatened to cut off regional oil exports - a significant proportion of global energy supply.</p>  <figure><img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/35YWVVF5JNIIDE2OZHHXSTW6WQ.jpg" alt="Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi speaks to the media, in Beirut"> 	 <figcaption style="text-align: center;"><i>Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi looks on as he speaks to the media, in Beirut, Lebanon, October 4, 2024.

                <p>Lawmakers clashed over the future of the nation's largest food aid program during U.S. House and Senate Agriculture Committee hearings on Tuesday, previewing a partisan fight over the issue in farm bill negotiations.</p><p>The conflict over potential cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program has flared in the ongoing budget reconciliation process and could serve as a roadblock to passage of a new farm bill this year.</p><p>The House Republican <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-house-republicans-set-vote-trumps-tax-cut-agenda-2025-02-25/">budget plan</a> would have the chamber's Agriculture Committee cut $230 billion as part of government-wide spending cuts to make way for President <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a>'s $4.5-trillion tax and border security agenda.</p><p>Democrats fear those cuts would come from SNAP, which sends an average benefit of $187 to about 41 million low-income people monthly, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data.</p><p>Any cuts to SNAP, also known as food stamps, would come as food prices climb, and as food banks strain under the twin pressures of high demand and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-cuts-hit-struggling-food-banks-risking-hunger-low-income-americans-2025-03-25/">cuts from the Trump administration</a>.</p><p>SNAP cuts would also hurt farmers due to reduced spending on food, said Angie Craig, the top Democrat on the House Agriculture Committee, at Tuesday's hearing.</p><p>"This cut would slash farm revenue by approximately $30 billion, on top of the markets they‚Äôre losing because of the dumbest trade war in history," she said.</p><p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has said Democrats will forcefully oppose any SNAP cuts in the budget plan.</p><p>Glenn "GT" Thompson, the chairman of the House committee, has said he aims to avoid benefit cuts, though he and other Republicans spoke in Tuesday's hearing of the need to strengthen the program's work requirements.</p><p>"We must preserve benefits for those truly in need but also ensure that SNAP guides participants to independence and self-sufficiency," Thompson said.</p><p>Democrats argue that expanding work requirements amounts to a benefit cut because it <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/poor-genxers-without-dependents-targeted-by-us-debt-ceiling-work-requirements-2023-05-29/">shrinks enrollment</a> in the program.</p><p>The issue also came up in Tuesday's Senate Agriculture Committee confirmation hearing for two Trump nominees, including Stephen Vaden, his pick for USDA deputy secretary.</p><p>Asked about work requirements, Vaden said SNAP benefits are meant to give "a helping hand" to those in acute need but that recipients should work their way out of the program.</p><p>The House and Senate Agriculture Committees must each pass their own versions of a farm bill and reconcile them into one bill to be voted on by the full Congress. The 2018 farm bill expired in 2023 and has been twice extended as the committees struggle to find agreement on policies such as SNAP.</p><p>The farm bill is a half-billion dollar spending package passed every five years that funds farm, conservation and nutrition programs.</p>  <figure><img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/4KKBGOMVL5JINFW5SC6AKS2AUI.jpg" alt="Trump administration's cuts to food bank funds risk hunger for low-income Americans"> 	 <figcaption style="text-align: center;"><i>Sara Busse, coordinator for Trinity's Table, a Charleston-based feeding ministry, adds canned goods to a food pantry at the Roosevelt Community Center as food banks across the country, already strained by rising demand, say they will have less food to distribute because of federal funding cuts and pauses by the Trump administration, in Charleston, West Virginia, U.S., March 19, 2025.

                <p>United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday rejected a new Israeli proposal to control aid deliveries in Gaza, saying it risks "further controlling and callously limiting aid down to the last calorie and grain of flour."</p><p>"Let me be clear: We will not participate in any arrangement that does not fully respect the humanitarian principles: humanity, impartiality, independence and neutrality," Guterres told reporters.</p><p>No aid has been delivered to the Palestinian enclave of some 2.1 million people since March 2. Israel has said it would not allow the entry of all goods and supplies into Gaza until Palestinian militants Hamas release all remaining hostages.</p><p>COGAT, the Israeli military agency that coordinates aid, last week met with U.N. agencies and international aid groups and said it proposed "a structured monitoring and aid entry mechanism" for Gaza.</p><p>"The mechanism is designed to support aid organizations, enhance oversight and accountability, and ensure that assistance reaches the civilian population in need, rather than being diverted and stolen by Hamas," COGAT posted on X on Sunday.</p><p>Jonathan Whittall, the senior U.N. aid official for Gaza and the West Bank, said last week that there was no evidence of aid being diverted.</p><p>Israel last month resumed its bombardment of Gaza after a two-month truce and sent troops back into the enclave.</p><p>"Gaza is a killing field ‚Äì and civilians are in an endless death loop," said Guterres as he again called for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages, a permanent ceasefire, and full humanitarian access in Gaza.</p><p>"With crossing points into Gaza shut and aid blockaded, security is in shambles and our capacity to deliver has been strangled," he said.</p><p>"As the occupying power, Israel has unequivocal obligations under international law ‚Äì including international humanitarian law and international human rights law," Guterres said.</p><p>That means Israel should facilitate relief programs and ensure food, medical care, hygiene and public-health standards in Gaza, he said. "None of that is happening today," he added.</p><p>Israel says it does not exercise effective control over Gaza and therefore is not an occupying power.</p><p>The war in Gaza was triggered on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas killed 1,200 people in southern Israel, and took some 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Since then, more than 50,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to Gaza health authorities.</p>  <figure><img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/IBA2UW5GEZKJDFKFP3WH4QWK4U.jpg" alt="UN Security Council comments on the escalating situation in South Sudan"> 	 <figcaption style="text-align: center;"><i>UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres makes comments on the security situation in South South Sudan, in New York City, U.S., March 28, 2025.

                <p>A Russian spacecraft safely delivered an American astronaut Jonathan Kim and two Russian cosmonauts to the International Space Station (ISS) on Tuesday, a flight hailed by Moscow as an example of fruitful Russia-U.S. space cooperation.</p><p>The Russian Soyuz 2.1a rocket blasted off from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan carrying Kim and Russians Sergei Ryzhikov and Alexei Zubritsky, docking three hours later with the ISS, Russia's Roscosmos state space corporation said.</p><p>Once the hatches were opened, Kim and the Russians were shown smiling and hugging their companions on the station, which now has 10 people on board, including four NASA astronauts, five Russians and Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi.</p><p>"Throughout his eight-month stay aboard the orbital outpost, Kim will conduct scientific research in technology development, Earth science, biology, human research, and more," NASA said in a statement.</p><p>President Vladimir Putin's investment envoy on Tuesday hailed U.S.-Russia space cooperation after the Russian rocket blasted off for the ISS.</p><p>Kirill Dmitriev, who is trying to spur a reset in U.S.-Russia ties and held talks in Washington last week, said Tuesday's launch was the latest example of an enduring relationship which traced its history back to 1975.</p><p>That was when the first crewed international space mission carried out jointly by the United States and the Soviet Union saw an Apollo and a Soyuz dock in space.</p><p>That mission, which featured the first international handshake in space, was a symbol of Cold War detente.</p><p>"Russian and U.S. cooperation in the space industry continues today," Dmitriev said on Tuesday, posting a video on his official Telegram channel of the Soyuz rocket blasting off.</p><p>Despite sweeping U.S. sanctions imposed on Moscow over its <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraine-russia-war/">war in Ukraine</a>, space is one area where cooperation has continued.</p><p>Dmitriev, who has talked up the possibility of joint Russian-U.S. investment in the Arctic and in the development of Russian rare earths, has said Moscow could supply <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-envoy-says-russia-could-supply-small-nuclear-power-plant-musks-mars-2025-03-27/">a small nuclear power plant</a> for a mission to Mars planned by billionaire entrepreneur and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk.</p><p>However, with the ISS nearing the end of its service life, Russia plans to go it alone with its own space station, for which it plans to launch the first two modules in 2027. It is also expanding its cooperation with China in space exploration.</p>  <figure><img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/EUXSWY7CPJM6JOSMDZ7GU25YPA.jpg" alt="The¬†Soyuz¬†MS-27 spacecraft¬†blasts¬†off¬†to the International Space Station (ISS) from the launchpad at the Baikonur Cosmodrome"> 	 <figcaption style="text-align: center;"><i>The¬†Soyuz¬†MS-27 spacecraft carrying the crew formed of NASA¬†astronaut¬†Jonny Kim, Roscosmos cosmonauts Sergey¬†Ryzhikov and Alexey Zubritskiy¬†blasts¬†off¬†to the International Space Station (ISS) from the launchpad at the Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan.

If we want to grow America's electricity production meaningfully over the next five or 10 years, we've got to stop closing coal plants," Wright said in the interview.</p><p>Asked about Trump's comment that the European Union should buy more energy from the United States, Wright said he has had countries in Asia, in Europe and elsewhere reach out to express interest in buying more American energy."</p><p>Wright said he does not think European countries will want to return to Russia for their energy supplies when the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraine-russia-war/">war in Ukraine</a> ends.</p><p>"As I talk to European leaders, one thing they all share is a regret that they bet their energy future on Russia," he said.

                <p>Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni will meet U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on April 17 to discuss <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-stokes-trade-war-world-reels-tariff-shock-2025-04-03/">the tariffs</a> that he has slapped on European Union imports, her office said on Tuesday.</p><p>The 27-nation bloc faces 25% import tariffs on steel and aluminium and cars, and broader tariffs of 20% from Wednesday for almost all other goods under Trump's policy to hit countries he says impose high barriers to U.S. imports.</p><p>Meloni told Italian business leaders that she supported an offer made by the European Commission to introduce a "zero-for-zero" tariff deal to avert a trade war with the United States.</p><p>"This is the negotiation that must see us all committed at all levels, which sees us committed and which commits me as I will be in Washington next April 17," Meloni said in a speech released by her staff.</p><p>A nationalist with deep admiration for Trump, Meloni is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/italys-meloni-torn-between-trump-european-allegiance-2025-03-21/">battling to reconcile</a> the growing gulf between her ideological instincts, which lie with Washington, and Italy's strategic ties to the European Union, analysts say.</p><p>She is under pressure also to defend Italy's export-driven industry, which last year ran a 40-billion-euro ($43.75-billion)trade surplus with the United States -- the third-largest in the European Union after Germany and Ireland.</p><p>Italy's exports to the U.S. are worth 10% of total exports.</p><p>"I think (tariffs) are an absolutely wrong decision on the part of the Trump administration. The economies of Western nations are strongly interconnected. Such hard-hitting protectionist policies will end up hurting Europe as much as the U.S.," Meloni said.</p><p>Meloni said her government would discuss with the European Union alternative ways to use already allocated EU funds to offset the expected negative impact of the tariffs.</p><p>"We are committed to use all available resources, starting with those that do not have an impact on public finances," she said.</p><p>With no extra-borrowing currently foreseen, she said some 14 billion euros could come from an overhaul of Italy's EU-backed post-COVID recovery plan, while an additional 11 billion would stem from EU regional development funds.</p><p>A further 7 billion euros were expected to be deployed using EU funds aimed at addressing climate change.</p><p>The government is preparing to cut its economic growth estimates for both this year and next amid mounting uncertainty caused by the U.S. tariffs, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday.</p><p>Italy's multi-year budget framework, due to be unveiled on Wednesday, forecasts gross domestic product in the euro zone's third largest economy to grow by 0.6% this year, down from a 1.2% target made last September, the sources said. Next year, GDP was seen at +0.8%, down from the previous +1.1% target.</p><p>($1 = 0.9142 euros)</p>  <figure><img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/AGZUJLWK6FNTTMVBMP6QEFZSBU.jpg" alt="Italian PM Giorgia Meloni attends the "master of the art of Italian cuisine award" ceremony, in Rome"> 	 <figcaption style="text-align: center;"><i>Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni speaks as she attends the "master of the art of Italian cuisine award" ceremony at Palazzo Chigi, in Rome, Italy, April 2, 2025.

                <p>Two U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday sent a letter to President Donald Trump's administration urging an end to a data agreement with the U.K. and to renegotiate a new one in the wake of reports that the U.K. ordered Apple to build a backdoor to access encrypted user data.</p><p>Ohio Republican Jim Jordan, who chairs the Judiciary Committee, and Arizona Republican Andy Biggs, who chairs a subcommittee on surveillance, asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to end the U.S.-U.K. agreement made under the CLOUD Act.</p><p>That agreement, which has been in place since 2019 and was renewed last year, allows the U.K. government to ask U.S. companies such as Apple <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/AAPL.O" target="_blank">(AAPL.O)</a> to hand over data during criminal investigations - but not if the targets are U.S. citizens.</p><p>The two members of the U.S. House of Representatives urged Bondi to "renegotiate it to adequately protect American citizens from foreign government surveillance," according to the letter, which was seen by Reuters.</p><p>The Washington Post in February reported that the British government ordered Apple to build a system that would give it powers to view end-to-end encrypted data uploaded by Apple users anywhere in the world - an unprecedented demand that the U.K. said is aimed at crime prevention and the pursuit of criminals.</p><p>Apple <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-removing-end-to-end-cloud-encryption-feature-uk-bloomberg-news-reports-2025-02-21/">withdrew</a> its Advanced Data Protection feature for U.K. users later that month and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-appealing-against-uk-governments-back-door-order-tribunal-confirms-2025-04-07/">is appealing the order</a>.</p><p>The U.K. order <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-examining-whether-uks-encryption-demand-apple-broke-data-treaty-2025-02-26/">sparked concern among U.S. officials</a> that it could violate the CLOUD Act agreement between the countries by allowing the U.K. to obtain the data of U.S. citizens.</p><p>CLOUD stands for "clarifying lawful overseas use of data."</p><p>"We are ... concerned that the order exposes all Apple users, including American citizens, to unnecessary surveillance and could enable foreign adversaries and nefarious actors to infiltrate such a backdoor," the U.S. lawmakers wrote.</p>  <figure><img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/YC2S2LUBLRNETM45QRTVVRPALE.jpg" alt="Press conference on the impeachment of U.S. Secretary of  Department of Homeland Security Mayorkas on Capitol Hill in Washington"> 	 <figcaption style="text-align: center;"><i>U.S. Rep.
