The company has focused on building cheap hardware for Alexa over the past decade and wasting efforts on failed ways for people to interact with the assistant rather than improving the core technology. The new Alexa was 100% rearchitected and is far more capable than its predecessor - which will remain accessible. It can order food, control smart home devices, create natural language security reports and menus, and much more.</div></article></section><section><header><div class="text-center text-3xl mt-3">🚀</div><h3 class="text-center font-bold">Science &amp; Futuristic Technology</h3></header><article class="mt-3"><a href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/alphabets-taara-chip-uses-light-beams-to-provide-high-speed-internet-140040922.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter"><b>Alphabet&#x27;s Taara chip uses light beams to provide high-speed internet (2 minute read)</b></a><div class="newsletter-html">Alphabet's Taara chip could lead to low-cost, high-speed internet connectivity even in distant locations.

The technology works similarly to traditional fiber except the light doesn't travel through cables. It only takes days to install instead of the months or years it takes to lay down fiber.

One of the reasons LLMs won't put software professionals out of work is because their job is to prove that code works - manually testing code is essential.

There seems to be diminishing returns in training unsupervised-learning large language models - scaling laws may have possibly met their natural end.

It is likely somewhere around o1-pro in terms of capability and ahead of DeepSeek-R1. DeepSearch can produce high quality responses to various research- or lookup-type questions, but it can still hallucinate information - even URLs. Overall, Grok 3 + Thinking feels somewhere around the state-of-the-art territory of OpenAI's strongest models, and slightly better than DeepSeek-R1 and Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking.</div></article><article class="mt-3"><a href="mailto:jobs@tldr.tech?utm_source=tldrnewsletter"><b>TLDR is hiring curators for our new TLDR Data newsletter (Fully Remote, $100/hr)</b></a><div class="newsletter-html">TLDR is hiring part time curators to launch our TLDR Data newsletter.<p></p><p>The ideal candidate would have deep experience working directly with data warehouses, data pipelines, data lakes, and other modern cloud infrastructure.</p><p>Time commitment is ~2-3 hours/week paid at a rate of $100/hr.
