                Existing models for deadlock detection and avoidance give practical solution only in the case of chains of independent tasks. In this paper we propose a non enumerative approach to deadlock avoidance when the workload consists of a graph-structured task system. The avoidance algorithm is based on an extention of the Coffman and Denning deadlock model.

                This paper presents a colored resourceoriented Petri net (CROPN) modeling method to deal with conflict and deadlock arising in Automated Guided Vehicles (AGV) systems. The work can be viewed as the continuation of some of the authors&#39; previous work. Some unique features in AGV systems require the further investigation into their deadlock avoidance using CROPN models. The proposed approach can easily handle both bidirectional and unidirectional paths. Bidirectional paths offer additional flexibility, efficiency and less cost than unidirectional paths. Yet they exhibit more challenging AGV management problems. By modeling nodes with places and lanes with transitions, one can easily construct a CROPN model for dynamic AGV systems with changing routes. A control policy suitable for real-time control implementation is then proposed.

                In this paper, incremental computation of schedules for complex discrete event systems in an uncertain environment is studied. Uncertainties are assumed to occur due to uncontrollable events. A particular class of flexible manufacturing systems (FMSs) with partial precedence constraints is proposed where some operations are performed with total precedence constraints and others with full routing flexibility (namely partial routing FMSs). Interruptions may occur due to unavailability of resources and interruption of operations. Such interruptions may deviate the trajectory from the planed schedule. For the modeling of the partial routing FMS, a systematic multi-level formalism based on the hierarchical structuration of the operations is introduced. Then, the risk of deviation is integrated and a new cost function is defined accordingly. Finally, a modified beam search algorithm referred to as generation double filtered beam search algorithm that accelerates the convergence of the method is proposed. The new algorithm is based on a new filtering mechanism that uses the cost function to selectively explore the state space of Petri net model in order to find a control sequence from an initial state to a reference one with a trade-off between performance and robustness. Examples are used to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed scheduling approach.

                Hierarchical data representations are powerful tools to analyze images and have found numerous applications in image processing. When it comes to multimodal images however, the fusion of multiple hierarchies remains an open question. Recently, the concept of braids of partitions has been proposed as a theoretical tool and possible solution to this issue. In this paper, we demonstrate the relevance of the braid structure for the hierarchical representation of multimodal images. We first propose a fully operable procedure to build a braid of partitions from two hierarchical representations. We then derive a framework for multimodal image segmentation, relying on an energetic minimization scheme conducted on the braid structure. The proposed approach is investigated on different multimodal images scenarios, and the obtained results confirm its ability to efficiently handle the multimodal information to produce more accurate segmentation outputs.

                The optimistic nature of Transactional Memory (TM) systems can lead to the concurrent execution of transactions that are later found to conflict. Conflicts degrade scalability, and may lead to aborts that increase wasted work, and degrade performance. A promising approach to reducing conflicts at runtime is dynamically, and transparently, reordering the execution of transactions upon discovery of conflicts. This approach has been explored in Software TMs (STMs), but not in Hardware TMs (HTMs). Furthermore, STM implementations of this approach cannot be ported to HTMs easily. This paper investigates the feasibility of such reordering in HTMs, and presents two designs that are scalable, independent of the on-chip interconnect, require only minor modifications to each core, and add no execution overhead if no conflicts occur. The evaluation takes LogTM-SE as a base line and considers benchmarks with different levels of contention (transactional conflicts). The results show that the preferred design increases HTM performance by up to 17% when contention is low, 57% when contention is high, and never degrades performance. Finally, the designs are orthogonal to LogTM-SE; they require no modification to cache structures, and continue to support transaction virtualization, open and closed unbounded nesting, paging, thread suspension, and thread migration.

                In this paper we study the problem of deadlock avoidance of production lines with shared resources. We use the Petri net model for production lines and a restrictive policy which prevents some enabled transition from firing for avoiding deadlock in the system. This is the safety control for non-stochastic discrete event systems. We generalise this notion of safety to the setting of stochastic discrete event systems, modelled as Markov chains. We propose a restriction policy for this generalised case.

                Structured occurrence nets (SONs) are a Petri net based formalism for portraying the behaviour of complex evolving systems. The concept extends that of occurrence netsa formalism that can be used to record causality and concurrency information concerning a single execution of a system. In SONs, multiple occurrence nets are combined by various types of relationships. In particular, relationships are included that enable the representation of dependencies between communicating and evolving sub-systems. In this paper, we introduce a tool for editing, simulating, and analysing SONs. The present version deals with three of the various types of abstractions that have been defined for SONs.

                This paper surveys recent research on the application of Petri net models to the analysis and synthesis of controllers for discrete event systems. Petri nets have been used extensively in applications such as automated manufacturing, and there exists a large body of tools for qualitative and quantitative analysis of Petri nets. The goal of Petri net research in discrete event systems is to exploit the structural properties of Petri net models in computationally efficient algorithms for computing controls. We present an overview of the various models and problems formulated in the literature focusing on two particular models, the controlled Petri nets and the labeled nets. We describe two basic approaches for controller synthesis, based on state feedback and event feedback. We also discuss two efficient techniques for the on-line computation of the control law, namely the linear integer programming approach which takes advantage of the linear structure of the Petri net state transiti...

                Deadlock can occur wherever multiple processes interact. System deadlock is a serious problem in a multiprogramming environment. The approaches to this problem can be divided into three categories: (1) prevention, (2) detection and recovery, and (3) avoidance. This paper proposes a variation of the first approach, partially applying ideas developed in the second and third approaches. This is an approach that is especially effective in process control computer systems, in which the application programs are usually fixed once designed. Using four predetermined application program parameters obtained in the program development stage, a directed graph model and a &quot;restriction&quot; matrix model are introduced representing the usage of common resources. Conditions sufficient for system deadlock prevention are presented along with algorithms for checking to see that the models meet these conditions. By using this approach, if a deadlock possibility is detected the causes can also be detected. The deadlock can thus be prevented during the program development stage. As the algorithms are not used in the real-time mode, there is no negative effect on the responsiveness of the system. A higher utilization rate of common resources is also ensured because the usage of resources is restricted only when the possibility of a deadlock is detected.

                Il Tribunale di Milano si misura con il delicato problema dell’interpretazione degli statuti di società, essendo stato chiamato ad occuparsi, in sede di reclamo di un provvedimento cautelare, dell’interpretazione di clausola statutaria dalla formulazione alquanto singolare, che mescola le caratteristiche di due note clausole di risoluzione delle situazioni di stallo (quelle di Russian roulette e quelle di Texas shoot-out). Di là del merito della vicenda, che ha visto coinvolti due noti ed esuberanti personaggi del mondo dei social, il provvedimento merita d’essere annotato non solo per essersi occupato di una tipologia di clausole (oramai nemmeno più tanto) “esotiche”, ma perché costituisce un interessante esempio delle contraddizioni in cui si dibattono gli operatori del diritto nel momento in cui si trovano a dover interpretare clausole statutarie dalla formulazione ambigua. Nel caso esaminato il Tribunale, nonostante un dichiarato impegno ad individuare la “volontà delle parti”, ha infatti interpretato la clausola ambigua secondo un criterio eminentemente oggettivo, cioè alla luce di quella che è la sua funzione socialmente tipica: quella di risolvere (rapidamente) una situazione di stallo.

‘Wild Bunch’ between Russian roulette and Texas shoot-out clauses: the interpretation of an ambiguous clause of a LLC charter, note to Trib. Milano 28 May 2014
The Court of Milan deals with the delicate problem of the interpretation of company by-laws, having been called upon, during the appeal of a precautionary measure, to interpret a clause with a rather singular wording, which mixes the characteristics of two well-known clauses for the resolution of stale-mate situations (Russian roulette and Texas shoot-out clauses). Regardless of the merits of the case, which involved two well-known and exuberant personalities from the italian world of social networking, the decision deserves to be noted not only for having dealt with a type of (nowadays not even so much) “exotic” clause, but also because it constitutes an interesting example of the contradictions in which legal practitioners find themselves when they must interpret ambiguously worded by-laws. In the case examined, the court, despite a declared commitment to identify the “will of the parties”, in fact interpreted the ambiguous clause according to an eminently objective criterion, i.e. in the light of what is its socially typical function: that of resolving (quickly) a dead-lock situation.

                The paradigm of computation on streaming data has received considerable recent attention. Streaming computations can be efficiently parallelized using systems of computing nodes organized in dataflow-like architectures. However, when these nodes have the ability to filter, or discard, some of their inputs, a system with finite buffering is vulnerable to deadlock. In this paper, we formalize a model of streaming computation systems with filtering, describe precisely the conditions under which such systems may deadlock, and propose provably correct mechanisms to avoid deadlock. Our approach relies on adding extra &quot;dummy&quot; tokens to the data streams and does not require global run-time coordination among nodes or dynamic resizing of buffers. This approach is particularly well-suited to preventing deadlock in distributed systems of diverse computing architectures, where global coordination or modification of buffer sizes may be difficult or impossible in practice.

                Streaming is a highly effective paradigm for expressing parallelism in high-throughput applictions. A streaming computation is a network of compute nodes connected by unidirectional FIFO channels. However, when these computations are mapped on to real parallel platforms, some computations, especially ones in which some nodes act as filters, can deadlock the system due to finite buffering on channels. In this paper, we focus on streaming computations which contain a commonly used structure called splitjoin. Based on our previous work, we propose two correct deadlock-avoidance algorithms for applications with the split-join structure. These algorithms are based on dummy messages, messages that the system generates in order to propagate information about the status of the computation. In one of these algorithms, only the split nodes generate dummy messages, but these messages are propagated by other nodes. In the other algorith, all nodes may potentially generate dummy messages, but these messages are not propagated. Theoretically, these algorithms are incomparable in terms of performance since there are conditions under which each outperforms the other. We focus on two representative applications, biological sequence alignment and random number generation, which can be efficiently parallelized with the split-join streaming structure. Our evaluation of these applications shows that the non-propagating algorithm generates much fewer dummy messages (and thus has a smaller overhead) than the propagating algorithm. In particular, even for systems which are very vulnerable to deadlocks (buffering ≤ 10 messages and filtering ≥ 95% of input data in one path), our non-propagating algorithm causes less than 10% message overhead. For systems with large buffer sizes or a low filtering ratio, the message overhead of the Non-propagating Algorithm is negligible.

                In this paper, we study the effect of various benchmark deadlock recovery strategies, and we find that each of these recovery strategies either results into another kind of deadlock or results into very high handling cost and long handling time. We also propose a new improved strategy in order to solve the shop deadlock problem through the use of both automated guided vehicle and a central buffer. To the best knowledge of the authors, till date, no research study has been performed to propose any such strategy in this regard or to study the effect of several deadlock recovery strategies altogether. Simulation result shows that the proposed strategy performs better than the existing benchmark recovery strategies and provides much improved solution to the shop deadlock problem, resulting into considerable reduction in handling time and cost and better handling of jobs in central buffer compared to various benchmark deadlock recovery strategies available in the literature.

                Deadlock is a highly unfavorable situation that can occur in flexible manufacturing systems. The occurrence of a deadlock can cripple parts of a production system and hinder flexible automation. It is necessary to develop control policies that avoid deadlocks by restricting the freedom in resource allocation; however, such policies can also negatively affect system performance indices. Feedback algorithms, which use information on the current operating condition of the system to avoid deadlock, can be distinguished based on the effects of the constraints they impose on the freedom in resource allocation. Referring to this characterization of the algorithms, this paper compares performances of some deadlock avoidance policies. First, theoretical analysis is carried out by introducing a criterion for ordering different policies by flexibility in resource allocation. Second, avoidance policies are applied to some case studies, which are simulated in details. The simulation analysis confirms the theoretical results showing that the algorithms allowing larger flexibility in resource allocation lead to better performance indices.

                Modern production facilities (i.e., flexible manufacturing systems) exhibit a high degree of resource sharing, a situation in which deadlocks (circular waits) can arise. Using digraph theoretic concepts we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for a deadlock occurrence and rigorously characterize highly undesirable situations (second level deadlocks), which inevitably evolve to circular waits in the next future. We assume that the system dynamics is described by a discrete event dynamical model, whose state provides the information on the current interactions job-resources. This theoretic material allows us to introduce some control laws (named restriction policies) which use the state knowledge to avoid deadlocks by inhibiting or by enabling some transitions. The restriction policies involve small on-line computation costs, so they are suitable for realtime implementation. For a meaningful class of systems one of these policies is the least restrictive deadlock-free policy one can find, namely it inhibits resource allocation only if leads directly to a deadlock. Finally, the paper discusses the computational complexity of all the proposed restriction policies and shows some examples to compare their performances.

                We give a formal account of a calculus for modeling service-based systems, suitable to describe both service composition (orchestration) and the protocol that services run when invoked (conversation). The calculus includes primitives for defining and for invoking services, for isolating conversations between requesters and providers of services, and primitives for orchestrating services, that is, to make use of existent services as building blocks to accomplish complex tasks. The calculus is equipped with a reduction and a labeled transition semantics; an equivalence result relates the two. To give an hint on how the structuring mechanisms of the language can be exploited for static analysis we present a simple type system guaranteeing the compatibility between the protocols for service definition and for service invocation, and ensuring the sequentiality of each protocol.

                Three-dimensional network-on-chips are suitable communication fabrics for high-density 3D many-core ICs. Such networks have shorter communication hop count, compared to 2D NoCs, and enjoy fast and power efficient TSV wires in vertical links. Unfortunately, the fabrication process of TSV connections has not matured yet, which results in poor vertical links yield. In this work, we address this challenge and introduce AFRA, a deadlock-free routing algorithm for 3D mesh-based NoCs that tolerates faults on vertical links. AFRA is designed to be simple, high performance, and robust. The simplicity is achieved by applying ZXY and XZXY routings in the absence and presence of fault, respectively. Furthermore, AFRA, as will be proved, is deadlock-free when all vertical faulty links have the same direction. This enables the routing to save virtual channels for performance rather than scarifying them for deadlock avoidance. Finally, AFRA provides robustness, which means supporting connection for all possible pairs of communicating nodes in high fault rates. AFRA is evaluated, though cycle accurate network simulation, and is compared with planar adaptive routing. Results reveal that AFRA significantly outperforms planar adaptive routing in both synthetic and real traffic patterns. In addition, the robustness of AFRA is calculated analytically.

                This paper addresses an efficient method to identify the process modules that can potentially cause deadlock in semiconductor track systems. Track systems carry out important functions in the photolithography process of semiconductor fabrication. Trends toward high automation and flexibility in the track systems accelerate the necessity of the intelligent controller that can guarantee deadlock-free operation of the track systems. However, there is a limitation when applying a deadlock avoidance policy in realtime due to the computational complexity caused by scores of modules, and complex and flexible process flows. To cope with that problem, this paper proposes an efficient method to identify potential deadlock process modules by introducing the concept of a potential deadlock set. The potential deadlock set is defined as the set of resources or modules that can result in deadlock in near future. Once the potential deadlock set is identified in the track system, a deadlock avoidance policy can be applied only to the process modules included in the potential deadlock set. Therefore, the approach using the potential deadlock set can significantly reduce the computational complexity when applying deadlock avoidance policy. Resource request matrix and genetic algorithm are used to find the potential deadlock set in the track systems.

                This paper presents a Petri net-based method for deadlock control in flexible assembly systems (FAS). Instead of a process-oriented modeling method, a resource-oriented Petri net modeling method is used. A new control policy is thus formulated and proved to outperform the existing one in the literature. The deadlock problem in FAS is often more difficult since deadlock can arise from improper base component flow and part flow, as well as ill-synchronized assembly operations.

                This paper presents a colored resourceoriented Petri net (CROPN) modeling method to deal with conflict and deadlock arising in Automated Guided Vehicles (AGV) systems. The work can be viewed as the continuation of some of the authors&#39; previous work. Some unique features in AGV systems require the further investigation into their deadlock avoidance using CROPN models. The proposed approach can easily handle both bidirectional and unidirectional paths. Bidirectional paths offer additional flexibility, efficiency and less cost than unidirectional paths. Yet they exhibit more challenging AGV management problems. By modeling nodes with places and lanes with transitions, one can easily construct a CROPN model for dynamic AGV systems with changing routes. A control policy suitable for real-time control implementation is then proposed.

                Petri nets (PN) represent a well known family of formalisms for the modeling and analysis of Discrete Event Systems (DES). As most formalisms for DES, PNs suffer from the state explosion problem. A way to overcome this difficulty is to relax the original discrete model and deal with a fully or partially continuous model. In contrast to continuous Petri nets that consider a full continuous firing of transitions, what can lead to the loss some properties of the original discrete model, this paper deals with Hybrid Adaptive Petri nets (HAPNs), that consider partially continuous firings. In an HAPN, a threshold is associated with each transition: if the load of the transition is higher than its threshold, it behaves as continuous; if it is lower, it behaves as discrete. This way, transitions adapt dynamically to their load. The reachability space and the deadlock-freeness property of HAPNs are studied and compared to those of discrete and continuous Petri nets.

                Mobile agent systems have unique properties and characteristics and represent a new application development paradigm. Existing solutions to distributed computing problems, such as deadlock avoidance algorithms, are not suited to environments where both clients and servers move freely through the network. This paper describes a distributed deadlock solution for use in mobile agent systems. The properties of this solution are locality of reference, topology independence, fault tolerance, asynchronous operation and freedom of movement. The presented technique, called the shadow agent solution proposes dedicated agents for deadlock initiation, detection and resolution. These agents are fully adapted to the properties of a mobile agent environment.

                The recital of Network-on-Chip (NoC) depends on the underlying routing techniques. There are a lot of requirements that has to be met. Such performance metrics are minimum latency, least power and maximum throughput. This paper deals with XY route, PROM routing, FTXY routing and DyAD routing on 5x5 2D torus topology. The simulation is performed on nirgam NoC simulator version 2.1 for constant bit rate traffic condition. The simulation results reveals the dominance of XY, PROM, FTXY and DyAD algorithms depicting the minimum values of overall average latency per channel (in clock cycles per flit) as 0.409836 overall average latency per channel (in clock cycles per packet) as 6.2535, average throughput as 16.68, and total network power as 35.6768 mw, achieved for FTXY routing algorithm.

                Software architectural style is one of the best concepts to define a family of related architectures and their common properties. Despite the essential role of software architectures in the software engineering practice, the lack of formal description and analysis may hamper the quality of designed models. Hence, using proper formal languages seems necessary for architectural style description. In this case, it is possible to use model checking to verify the designed models automatically. However, the model checking of complex software systems suffers from the state space explosion problem. To handle this problem, data mining techniques may contribute to obtain the required knowledge for intelligent model checking i.e. searching only a portion of the state space. In this paper, to check the model of complex software systems which are designed according to an architectural style, an efficient approach is proposed using data mining techniques. These software systems must be specified through architectural styles and modeled by Graph Transformation Systems (GTS) formally. In the proposed approach, to check a large model based on a specific style intelligently, a specific knowledge is required. Such knowledge is acquired from mining the data of checking a smaller model consistent with the same style. These smaller models can be designed either by the designers or can be automatically generated consistent with the style. The proposed solution can be used to verify the reachability property and to refute the safety and liveness properties. This solution is implemented in GROOVE, a toolset for designing and model checking of graph transformation systems. The experimental results show that our method is faster and more accurate in comparison with the existing techniques in model checking of complex software systems.

                Assessing the reliability of safety-critical systems is an important and challenging task because even a minor failure in these systems may result in catastrophic consequences, like losing human life. A well-known and fully automatic technique in reliability assessing approaches is model checking. However, applying this technique to verify some properties such as safety may lead to the state space explosion problem in which all reachable states cannot be checked due to computational limitations. In such situations that the verification of a safety property is infeasible, it is possible to refute the safety property by searching a reachable state in which a sp ecial configuration (e.g., an error or an undesirable behavior) occurs. Therefore, checking reachability can be done instead of refuting the corresponding safety property. Finding such reachable states, in the worst case, may cause the state space explosion problem again. Hence, using evolutionary algorithms to explore the state space efficiently can be a promising idea. In this paper, at first, we propose an evolutionar y algorithm to check reachability properties and refute safety ones in software systems specified formally through graph transformations. Since the accuracy and convergence speed of the proposed approach can still be improved, we employ the Bayesian Optimization Algorithm (BOA) to propose another approach. In BOA, a Bayesian network is learnt from the population and then sampled to generate new solutions. The proposed approaches can be used to analyse the reachability and safety properties. The proposed approaches are implemented in GROOVE which is an open source toolset for designing and model checking graph transformation systems. To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed approaches, different benchmark problems are employed. Experimental results show that the proposed approaches are faster and more accurate than the existing methods.

                A real-time deadlock avoidance policy is proposed for a subclass of FMS. To model the flow of parts in the FMS, a new formulation, which separates the controller from the workcell dynamics, is adapted. The controller is rule-based, and is represented as a set of matrix equations over (min, +) algebra. The proposed scheme is founded on a Petri netbased analysis of deadlock situations in FMS. It handles the problem of deadlock on an on-line basis, as part of the more general issue of conflict resolution .

                Everlasting demands for solutions to ever growing computation problems and demands for efficient means to manage and utilize sophisticated information have caused an increase in the amount of data necessary,to handle a job, while drastic reduction in CPU prices is encouraging massive parallel architectures foE gigantic data processing. These trends are increasing the importance of a large shared buffer memory with 103-10 4 simultaneously accessible ports. This paper proposes a multiport page buffer architecture that allows 10 3_ l0 4 concurrent accesses and causes no access conflict nor suspension. It consists of a set of memory banks and multistaged switching networks with controllers that control each row of the networks. Consecutive words in each page are stored orthogonally across banks. Memory interleaving may be applied to improve access rate in consecutive retrievals. When used as a disk cache memory, it decreases the number of disk accesses and increases both the page transfer rate and the maximum number of concurrent page accesses.

                One of the most interesting research questions for the microarchitecture community is: &quot;How can we effectively use the increasing number of transistors available on a single chip while avoiding wire delay problem?&quot; The time needed for a signal to reach the opposite edge of a chip is becoming longer than one cycle, and because of this, it becomes hard to gain more performance improvement with the scaling of superscalar architectures. One viable solution for using all the available transistors efficiently and effectively, while hiding wire delay as much as possible is to parallelize resource usage through resource clustering and decoupling. Recently a good number of tiled/clustered architectures have been proposed, indicating that this field is gathering high interest from both academia and industry.

                To develop an efficient implementation of the maximally permissive deadlock avoidance policy (DAP) for complex resource allocation systems (RAS), a recent approach focuses on the identification of a set of critical states of the underlying RAS state-space, referred to as minimal boundary unsafe states. The availability of this information enables an expedient one-step-lookahead scheme that prevents the RAS from reaching outside its safe region. This paper presents a symbolic approach that provides those critical states. Furthermore, by taking advantage of certain structural properties regarding RAS safety, the presented method avoids the complete exploration of the underlying RAS state-space. Numerical experimentation demonstrates the efficiency of the approach for developing the maximally permissive DAP for complex RAS with large structure and state-spaces, and its potential advantage over similar approaches that employ more conventional representational and computational methods.

                Deadlock avoidance for resource allocation systems (RAS) is a well-established problem in the Discrete Event System (DES) literature. This paper is mainly concerned with modeling the class of Conjunctive / Disjunctive sequential resource allocation systems (C/D RAS) as finite automata extended with variables. The proposed modeling approach allows for modeling multiple instance execution, routing flexibility and failure handling. With an appropriate model of the system, a symbolic approach is then used to synthesize the optimal supervisor, in the least restrictive sense. Furthermore, a set of compact logical formulae can be extracted and attached to the original model, which results in a modular and comprehensible representation of the supervisor.

                Supervisory controllers for automated manufacturing systems must assure good system performance and guarantee deadlock-free operation. Order release mechanisms are performance control policies that order and schedule the release of work into the system, while deadlock avoidance policies are control policies that inhibit enabled events that might lead to deadlock. Because neither policy explicitly considers the objectives of the other, their decisions often conflict. To guarantee continuing system operation, these conflicts must be resolved in favor of the deadlock avoidance policy, and as a result, the intended beneficial effects of the order release mechanism can be significantly undermined. The goals of this paper are (1) to demonstrate how deadlock avoidance and order release can be integrated to form a control policy that ensures continued system operation and improved performance with regard to performance measures, and (2) to experimentally investigate the important interactions that can arise between these two types of control.

                Avoiding deadlock is essential in the operation of highly automated manufacturing systems. Many of these systems support sufficient redundancy to permit flexible part routing. Although flexible routing improves the inherent operational flexibility of these systems, it also requires more highly sophisticated supervisory control techniques. The objective of this work is to characterize the deadlock avoidance problem for systems with flexible routing capabilities. Specifically, the paper addresses deadlock avoidance for single capacity systems (each machine has a single unit of buffer capacity), and mixed capacity systems (some machines have multiple units of buffer capacity). For each of these, we characterize deadlock and prove the correctness of several methods of suboptimal deadlock avoidance. We also address two interesting special cases. The first assumes that every stage of every part type can be performed on at least one multiple capacity machine, whereas the second provides a finite central buffer that can be revisited after every processing stage. For the first case, we present two suboptimal deadlock avoidance approaches, while for the second, we show optimal deadlock avoidance to be computationally tractable.

                This paper is focused on presenting the architecture and the implementation of a semi autonomous simulation based system which is able to navigate into a partially known environment. Most of robotic agent does not support mobility according the requirements of applications. Our implementation provides a semi autonomous system which is used by an operator performing several services with better quality and low costs. The design is a module based architecture which supports the robot navigation using simulation offline software and on line at the moment when the agency percepts obstacles. The robot changes states of its mobility in real time building a new strategy to achieve the normal path received from a simulator that execute and communicate the path calculated by a simple navigational algorithm in the virtual static environment. Using a communication protocol between robotic unit and simulator software, it is possible to correct data and to improve the system behavior through a wireless communication. The physical system is tested in a laboratory environment. It is situated in a environment which is the same designed in the simulator. The robot updates its coordinates in the virtual environment and the simulation runs exactly according the navigation algorithms until the sensor module transmits to simulation software new data of obstacle presence. We evaluate the performance of the system and the results confirm an improved behavior of robotic agent in extreme situations of dynamic environment.

                Network-on-Chip (NoC) is an efficient on-chip communication architecture specifically for System-on-a-Chip (SoC) design. However, the input buffers of a NoC router often take a significant portion of the silicon area and power consumption. Besides, the performance of a NoC is also greatly affected by the buffer size. In this article, a static buffer merging and resource sharing method is proposed for the application-specific SoC minimizing the NoC buffer. When given an application-specific task graph and the dataflow distribution, the proposed method statically merges rarely used buffers and generates the suitable number of input buffers for each router at design timely. The merged buffer is shared by several input directions. The experimental result shows that the buffer can be utilized more effectively after the resource sharing. Based on the synthesized design with TSMC 90nm technology, the proposed method reduces an average of 42.23% area and 35.13% power while providing similar...

                This paper deals with a new issue encountered in industry, e.g. the bottlenecks of industrial internet of things (IIoT) automation devices, such as flexible manufacturing systems (FMS). We model such systems with Petri nets and we impose a restrictive policy in order to reject bottlenecks in the system. Deadlocks in automations driven through IIoT applications occur mainly when two or more devices try to access the same resource. In order to solve these issues we use Petri net models which ensure reversibility of the net, respectively to grant the recoverability property of the modelled system. We deal with reversibility of a net not necessary to find returning routes from bottlenecks, but also by finding alternative routes for avoiding deadlocks in the IIoT controlled system. We emphasize our approach with an example, and we propose a general policy for these systems in order to ensure their vivacity.

                The advances in networked industrial enterprises to meet the demands for high productivity level as well as for quality and operational flexibility has driven the development of anthropocentric system that emphasize the importance of human operator. However, greater flexibility and autonomy means greater complexity in the flow of items (material and information) in a system. Thus, this work discusses the concept of Anthropocentric Production Systems (APS) and how it should be implemented do avoid deadlock problem. In particular, the techniques based on Petri nets and Request-Allocation Graphs (RAG) are introduces to the design of deadlock avoidance compensators, employed to support the task of system control program redesign, the only solution in case of extreme changes in the environmental conditions.

                Flexible manufacturing system (FMS) has several advantages compared to conventional systems such as higher machine utilization, higher efficiency, less inventory, and less production time. On the other hand, FMS is expensive and complicated. One of the main problems that may happen is the deadlock. Deadlock is a case that happens when one operation or more are unable to complete their tasks because of waiting of resources that are used by other processes. This may occur due to inappropriate sharing of the resources or improper resource allocation logic which may lead to deadlock occurrence due to the complexity of assigning shared resources to different tasks in an efficient way. One of the most effective tools to model and detect the deadlocks is the petri net. In this research the MATLAB software was used to detect the deadlock in two parallel lines with one shared machines. The analysis showed that the highest utilization is in transition t4 with 71% and the longest waiting time is in place p4 at 72 seconds. Hence, deadlock was located there as parts wait to be processed by machine 1 which is busy to perform processes on parts in both lines.
