Not only will it make you yearn for a car from your childhood that isn&#8217;t as good as you remember, but it will make you pay good money for it. In the case of this 1991 <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/this-12-cylinder-geo-metro-is-one-way-to-die-buy-it-if-you-dare">Geo Metro</a> convertible that&#8217;s <a href="https://www.streetsideclassics.com/vehicles/8685-cha/1991-geo-metro-convertible" rel="nofollow">for sale</a>, not only is the car nostalgic but so is its price. The dealer is asking $9,995 for the 33-year-old Geo, which was its original MSRP when new.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">The Geo Metro was never a beloved car. It was essentially a way for GM to repackage the Suzuki Swift and contend in the affordable hatchback market. The problem was that it lacked the charm of its competitors like the <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/this-rare-honda-crx-convertible-deserves-some-tlc-and-its-for-sale">Honda CRX</a>. The 1.0-liter Suzuki-sourced three-cylinder was reliable enough, but Metros suffered from rust and rot issues and didn&#8217;t hold up to the beating that they usually took from their often very young owners. There&#8217;s a reason why they&#8217;re hard to find in good condition nowadays.</p>    <figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1920" height="1080" loading="lazy" data-id="6466511" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/geo-metro-convertible-7.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6466511" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1920" height="1080" loading="lazy" data-id="6466510" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/geo-metro-convertible-6.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6466510" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1920" height="1080" loading="lazy" data-id="6466507" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/geo-metro-convertible-8.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6466507" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1920" height="1080" loading="lazy" data-id="6466516" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/geo-metro-convertible-1.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6466516" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1920" height="1080" loading="lazy" data-id="6466514" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/geo-metro-convertible-5.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6466514" /></figure> <figcaption class="blocks-gallery-caption wp-element-caption"><em>Streetside Classics</em></figcaption></figure>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">In this specific car&#8217;s defense, it&#8217;s a two-door, four-seat convertible with a naturally aspirated engine and a manual transmission. There are some kids in Little Tikes Cozy Coupes that are faster, as the Metro only made 55 horsepower and 58 lb-ft of torque when new, but hey—slow car fast, right? Just don&#8217;t turn on the air conditioning if you hope to reach your destination in a timely manner. </p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Still, cheap, fun convertibles don&#8217;t really exist in the U.S. market anymore. Back when this was new, there was the Metro, the Volkswagen Cabrio, and the <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/new-cars/pontiac-fiero-race-car-review-lemons-price-specs-driving">Pontiac Fiero</a>. So this Metro does take you back to a more enjoyable time for the cheap car market.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">The &#8217;91 Metro convertible is in nearly pristine condition, which is surprising given its 69,448 miles. Whoever owned this car took care of it, which can&#8217;t be said of most Geos over the years. It&#8217;s also shockingly devoid of rust. But does all of that make it worth a little more than $10,000 after taxes and registration? Probably not. In 10 minutes, I can find you two dozen fantastic convertibles on Facebook Marketplace for the same money or less. Miatas, BMW Z3s <em>and</em> Z4s, Audi TTs, Mercedes R129 SLs—I could go on and on. They won&#8217;t have the same miles, nor will they be in the same condition, but they&#8217;ll be far more enjoyable cars to own and live with.</p>    <figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-2 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1920" height="1080" loading="lazy" data-id="6466515" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/geo-metro-convertible-2.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6466515" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1920" height="1080" loading="lazy" data-id="6466509" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/geo-metro-convertible-10.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6466509" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1920" height="1080" loading="lazy" data-id="6466508" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/geo-metro-convertible-11.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6466508" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1920" height="1080" loading="lazy" data-id="6466513" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/geo-metro-convertible-3.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6466513" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1920" height="1080" loading="lazy" data-id="6466506" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/geo-metro-convertible-9.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6466506" /></figure> <figcaption class="blocks-gallery-caption wp-element-caption"><em>Streetside Classics</em></figcaption></figure>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">But if this Geo Metro tickles your fancy for cheap 1990s convertibles, or maybe there&#8217;s something sentimental about it, this is about as clean as you&#8217;ll find.

                <img src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/bmw-s65-swap-1.jpg?quality=85"> <p class="article-paragraph skip"><a href="https://www.thedrive.com/category/bmw-news">BMW</a> nerds know the significance of the P65 V8, but if you don&#8217;t, let me give you the rundown. The racing engine was a heavily modified version of BMW&#8217;s 4.0-liter naturally aspirated S65, and it was used in the <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/accelerator/36773/bmw-emerges-victorious-at-nurburgring-24-after-9-5-hour-rain-delay">BMW Z4 GT3</a> and E92 BMW M3 GT2. For racing duty, the P65 was stroked to 4.4 liters, given a dry sump oil system, upgraded cams, and much, much more. It also sounded absolutely epic. So you can imagine how big my eyes became when I learned that a tuning shop was stuffing one under the hood of a 2011 <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/bmw-uk-just-dropped-a-glorious-collection-of-photos-and-info-on-16-historic-cars">BMW 1 Series M</a>.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Evolve Automotive—the same UK-based tuner that makes Eventuri carbon fiber air intakes—already had an S65 engine in its 1 Series M to replace the original 3.0-liter turbocharged straight-six. However, the P65 engine is the ultimate version of that V8 and brings genuine motorsport DNA to the M division&#8217;s smallest car.</p>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1920" height="1080" loading="lazy" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/bmw-s65-swap-1-2.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85&#038;w=1920" alt="" class="wp-image-6466462" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Evolve Automotive</em> </figcaption></figure>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Admittedly, some of that motorsport DNA was lost on its way into the little 1M. For road-car use, Evolve had to swap its dry-sump oil system for a more conventional wet-sump, replace the cams, and remove the ultra-cool carbon fiber intake plenum for an Eventuri one. The ECU also needed to be modified. However, most of the engine&#8217;s motorsport internals remain. How much of its original 500 horsepower and 382 lb-ft of torque stuck around is yet to be seen. Fingers crossed it can still rev close to 9,500 rpm with the different cams, as it sounds sensational near its redline in motorsport guise. Evolve only gives a brief sample of the final project&#8217;s exhaust but it&#8217;s at idle, so there&#8217;s no way to know how it will sound at full chat.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">We likely won&#8217;t see this car used in anger much, if at all, as it&#8217;s eventually going to be a show car at SEMA in November. Before it heads to Las Vegas, though, it&#8217;s going to Connecticut, where FCP Euro will work on its suspension. We&#8217;ll hopefully get to see it hit the track after it&#8217;s done with its tour of the U.S., as an M car with a racing engine needs to be used properly. While this isn&#8217;t the world&#8217;s first-ever P65 swap as that video title claims (<a href="https://www.m3post.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1706089" rel="nofollow">there are a few P65 swaps</a> documented on various forums) it might be the first P65 swapped into a 1 Series M, which is enough to get me very excited.</p>    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7qirlzLKDA"><div class="lazied-youtube-frame" data-video-id="Q7qirlzLKDA" data-iframe-classes="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"> 	<img class="lazied-youtube-frame-thumbnail" loading="lazy" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q7qirlzLKDA/hqdefault.jpg" />  	 		 		 	 </div></a>   	        <p class="article-paragraph skip"><em>Got tips?

And while we don&#8217;t yet know how much it&#8217;ll cost, it seems safe to bet that the Bronco&#8217;s entry price will drop a fair amount.</p>    <figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-3 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="722" height="960" loading="lazy" data-id="6466440" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/463180950_9251727251524006_55942.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6466440" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="746" height="960" loading="lazy" data-id="6466441" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/463438991_9251726694857395_13825.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6466441" /></figure> <figcaption class="blocks-gallery-caption wp-element-caption"><em>Via Ford Bronco Base Facebook Group</em></figcaption></figure>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">The Bronco Base is marked for late availability, meaning you won&#8217;t be able to get one right away. Still, once it eventually launches, you&#8217;ll be able to get it with the seven-speed manual and 2.3-liter EcoBoost four-cylinder. I haven&#8217;t found out whether the 2.7-liter twin-turbo V6 and 10-speed automatic will be optional on the entry-level trim, but they were previously.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Importantly, you&#8217;ll be able to get a Bronco Base with the Sasquatch Package once again. Snagging the most budget-friendly Bronco with 35-inch Goodyear Wrangler MTs, upgraded suspension, a 4.7 final drive ratio, and front and rear lockers from the factory sounds pretty nice. The Sasquatch Package isn&#8217;t as cheap as it used to be—for 2024, it&#8217;s $8,460 with non-beadlock-capable wheels and $9,455 with the beadlocks—so if that&#8217;s your plan, you better set aside an extra chunk of change on top of whatever Ford charges for the Bronco Base.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Other additions to the 2025 Bronco, per the guide, include a new Stroppe Edition trim (which <a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2024/10/15/2025-ford-bronco-stroppe-special-edition-honors-the-original-baj.html" rel="nofollow">Ford already announced</a>), the Free Wheeling Package on Big Bend models, and Desert Sand, Marsh Gray, and Ruby Red Metallic Tinted Clearcoat paint colors. Gone are Cactus Gray, Iconic Silver, Hot Pepper Red Metallic Tinted Clearcoat, Peak Blue, Race Red, and Yellowstone color options. The rest of the changes are pretty minor from what I can tell. When asked for comment on the info contained in the sheet, a Ford PR representative told <em>The Drive</em>, &#8220;We’ll have more to share on 2025 Bronco in the next few weeks.&#8221;</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">I&#8217;m eager to hear how much the 2025 Bronco Base will cost. I don&#8217;t expect it to be sub-$30,000 like it was back in 2021, especially since it was around $37,000 when it left after 2023. It&#8217;ll have to stay close to that if it wants to compete with <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/2025-jeep-wrangler-ditches-manual-crank-windows-after-all-these-years">the Jeep Wrangler Sport</a>, which starts at $34,585 for the two-door and $39,185 for the four-door.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip"><em>Got a tip or question for the author?

Privately owned since 2022, the storied brand <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/carrozzeriabertone_some-designs-are-timeless-they-transcend-activity-7250094342873264129-7L3o?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" rel="nofollow">published a dark preview image</a> last week that shows the outline of a wedge-shaped roadster. Couple that with a mention of a vehicle &#8220;first revealed in 1969&#8221; that won the Gran Turismo Award at the 2022 Pebble Beach Concours, and there&#8217;s no doubt about it—Bertone is reimagining its Autobianchi A112 Runabout concept. </p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Most of the original design study&#8217;s key styling cues look like they&#8217;re accounted for in the teaser. Beyond a doorstop-like silhouette, the concept features pronounced wheel arches, wide wheels, and what we&#8217;re somewhat sure is a removable roof panel. It&#8217;s not merely a copy-paste job, however: The modern-day Runabout gains a much taller windshield than its predecessor and a smoother-looking roll bar without lights that poke out like eyes.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">There&#8217;s no word on what powers the born-again Runabout, though we&#8217;re hoping it uses a mid-mounted, four-cylinder engine like the original. It&#8217;s not too far-fetched to speculate that Bertone bought an existing engine; <a href="https://bertone.it/gb110/" rel="nofollow">its GB110</a> is powered by Lamborghini&#8217;s 5.2-liter V10, for example.</p>    <figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-1 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-4 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="2000" height="1333" loading="lazy" data-id="6466342" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/rg-retromobile-2020-bertone-runabout-concept-1.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6466342" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="2000" height="1333" loading="lazy" data-id="6466343" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/rg-retromobile-2020-bertone-runabout-concept-2.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6466343" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="2000" height="1333" loading="lazy" data-id="6466344" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/rg-retromobile-2020-bertone-runabout-concept-3.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6466344" /></figure> <figcaption class="blocks-gallery-caption wp-element-caption">1969 Autobianchi A112 &#8220;Runabout&#8221; concept. <em>Ronan Glon</em></figcaption></figure>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Shown above, the Runabout concept made its debut at the 1969 Turin Auto Show. The late, great Marcello Gandini, the legendary designer of the Lamborghini Countach among many other beloved cars, drew inspiration from the world of speedboats to create what he imagined as a successor to the Fiat 850 Spider. The result was a two-seat roadster characterized by an angular design, a short windshield, and a Kamm tail. There was no shortage of oddities; you won&#8217;t find a speedometer, but Bertone was kind enough to put a compass on the dashboard. Power came from a Fiat 128-sourced four-cylinder engine linked to a manual transmission.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">While the Runabout didn&#8217;t receive the proverbial green light for production, it influenced the X1/9 that launched in 1972 to replace the 850 Spider. It&#8217;s too early to tell if the second time will be the charm, as Bertone hasn&#8217;t announced what the future holds for the concept. If the roadster reaches production, we expect that it will land as a limited-edition model with a relatively high price tag and numerous customization options.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip"><em>Got tips?

Yes. I&#8217;m really talking about this tool again. It&#8217;s legitimately amazing. I bought this thing for myself way back in 2022 and have used it for every major job since. Being able to set it up with cut-off discs, sanding discs, wire wheels, and anything else that&#8217;ll fit in the 1/4-inch collet makes it as versatile as any other die-grinder. The fact that it does away with air hoses for batteries takes it to the next level. The performance is there, too.

In a 10-second video posted to X, Ferrari showed off a supercar under a red sheet, along with a reveal date of October 17 at 8 a.m. Eastern. As many have speculated, it appears to point to the unveiling of the long-awaited successor to the LaFerrari.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Of course, Ferrari hasn&#8217;t explicitly said what this car is going to be. However, back in June, a<a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/looks-like-ferrari-will-drop-a-road-version-of-the-499p"> few very special Ferrari customers</a> were given a sneak preview of Maranello&#8217;s upcoming project, and they hinted that it&#8217;s packing technology from the two-time Le Mans-winning <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/2024-le-mans-24-ferrari-wins-back-to-back-nearly-runs-out-of-fuel-doing-it">Ferrari 499P</a>. That prototype race car uses a 3.0-liter, 571-horsepower twin-turbocharged V6 with a 268-hp electric motor on the front axle. <a href="https://www.thesupercarblog.com/ferrari-f250-teased-laferrari-successor-to-debut-on-october-17/" rel="nofollow">There have been rumblings</a> that Ferrari could add two more motors to the powertrain, but regardless, Maranello is free to go well beyond the limitations stipulated by Le Mans Hypercar-class regulations.</p>    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p class="article-paragraph skip" lang="en" dir="ltr">Something new is on the horizon. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FerrariSupercars?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#FerrariSupercars </a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ferrari?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Ferrari </a> <a href="https://t.co/kfpg1J80jM">pic.twitter.com/kfpg1J80jM</a></p>&mdash; Ferrari (@Ferrari) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ferrari/status/1846559095836606511?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October  16, 2024</a></blockquote>     <p class="article-paragraph skip">Another possible hint that we&#8217;re looking at the next Ferrari flagship under that red fabric is that it&#8217;s been shared by the <a href="https://x.com/FerrariHypercar" rel="nofollow">Ferrari Hypercar Le Mans team account</a>.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Ferrari&#8217;s teaser simply pans around the cloaked vehicle from overhead in a dimly-lit garage, before flashing the date of its debut. The silhouette beneath the red sheet echoes the stylized sketch of the car teased in Ferrari&#8217;s secret meeting. At the very least, it seems to have a massive rear wing, narrow cockpit, and some pointy front fenders. Just from its size and overall shape, it looks like a LaFerrari with more prominent aero.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Ferrari vice-chairman Piero Ferrari—Enzo&#8217;s son—told <em><a href="https://www.topgear.com/car-news/supercars/laferrari-successor-coming-soon-confirms-piero-ferrari" rel="nofollow">Top Gear</a></em> back in June that a LaFerrari successor was on the way. “Every ten years, we have one,” he said. Since the LaFerrari launched in 2013, the brand is overdue for a replacement.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">There had been a bit of confusion earlier in the morning, as Ferrari initially published its teaser with an erroneous time of &#8220;14:00 p.m. CEST.&#8221; The announcement was briefly deleted, before reappearing with a proper 2 p.m. CEST time.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">In any case, Maranello&#8217;s new halo car appears to be landing just in time to take on the newly revealed <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/new-2-1-million-mclaren-w1-is-a-rear-drive-hybrid-with-a-great-power-to-weight-ratio">McLaren W1</a>. Unless Porsche is ready to surprise us all with an announcement of a new hybrid flagship of its own, we aren&#8217;t likely to see a rematch of the early-2010s holy trinity of hypercars. Prove us wrong, Stuttgart.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip"><em>Got tips?

A week ago, the automaker announced a massive recall of 1.7 million vehicles for steering problems. Now adding insult to that injury (or maybe just more injury), Honda is recalling a further 720,000 vehicles for fuel pump problems. While some <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/2-6m-hondas-and-acuras-recalled-for-faulty-fuel-pumps-yes-even-the-nsx">fuel pump failures can cause your car to stall</a> or not start, this defect can make combustion happen <em>outside</em> your engine—and that isn&#8217;t good.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Announced Tuesday, <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/category/honda-news">Honda</a> states the defect is found in the fuel pump of certain 2023 through 2025 model year vehicles. The NHTSA has not published an in-depth report on the recall yet, but Honda says there is a problem with the &#8220;core&#8221; of these vehicles&#8217; high-pressure fuel pumps. The pumps may have internal cracks (potentially from manufacturing errors) that may expand during operation, and eventually leak. Like any external fuel leak, it technically poses a fire risk, though Honda says it is unaware of any crashes or injuries associated with the defect.</p>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="960" height="640" loading="lazy" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/10-2023-Honda-CR-V-Sport-Touring.jpeg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="2025 Honda CR-V hybrid" class="wp-image-6466307" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">2025 Honda CR-V Hybrid. <em>Honda</em> </figcaption></figure>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Vehicles known to be affected include 2023 and newer <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/car-reviews/2023-honda-cr-v-hybrid-review-specs-price-options-impressions">CR-V Hybrids</a>, the 2023 and 2024 <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/this-shorty-honda-ev-prototype-is-how-the-accord-should-really-look">Accord</a> and Accord Hybrid, and 2025 Civics along with <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/car-reviews/2025-honda-civic-hybrid-first-drive-review">its own hybrid version</a>. Honda indicates a potential sign of the defect is the smell of fuel while idling or driving, and that it will begin notifying affected owners in December. They will be mailed instructions to visit a <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/category/honda-reviews">Honda</a> dealer for a free inspection, plus replacement if the part is found to be faulty. Owners can also check <a href="http://www.recalls.honda.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Recalls.Honda.com</a> to see if their vehicle is involved.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Some of these same vehicles were implicated in last week&#8217;s recall as well, notably the Civic and CR-V. The availability of recall services may be slightly staggered, however, with notices for the steering defect being issued starting in November. Some of you might have to make more than one trip to the dealer, but at least the fix won&#8217;t be on your dollar.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip"><em>Got a tip or question for the author?

If it&#8217;s rear-wheel-drive, two-door thrills you want, <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/car-reviews/2023-bmw-m2-review">BMW builds an actual coupe for precisely that purpose</a>. But if you want to poke your foot into the Bimmer life with a more practical compact that&#8217;s enjoyable enough to drive, it fits the role decently. After four years, it&#8217;s finally getting a replacement, and now we&#8217;ve got our first look at the second generation.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">The 2025 2 Gran Coupe will roll off BMW&#8217;s Leipzig assembly lines before the year is out, and begin reaching U.S. dealers in March. Sales will kick off with the 228 xDrive Gran Coupe and M235 xDrive Gran Coupe; the former will start at $42,775 including destination, while the latter will start at $50,675. The front-wheel-drive 228 Gran Coupe will arrive later in 2025, with a base price of $40,775. Compared to the current model year, the whole range is just over $2,000 more expensive, on average.</p>    <figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-5 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="2560" height="1440" loading="lazy" data-id="6466180" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/P90572288_highRes-copy.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6466180" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="2560" height="1440" loading="lazy" data-id="6466181" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/P90572425_highRes-copy.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6466181" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="2560" height="1810" loading="lazy" data-id="6466182" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/P90572287_highRes-copy.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6466182" /></figure> <figcaption class="blocks-gallery-caption wp-element-caption">2025 BMW M235 xDrive Gran Coupe. <em>BMW, Fabian Kirchbauer</em></figcaption></figure>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">The compact&#8217;s new exterior isn&#8217;t a massive departure from its predecessor&#8217;s, though I&#8217;d argue it&#8217;s a step in the right direction. Many <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/category/bmw-news">BMW</a> fans haven&#8217;t taken to the smoother, rounder, friendlier design of the brand&#8217;s entry-level models, but I happen to think the new 2 looks nice, mostly because it reminds me of a late-model Ford Focus. The kidneys appear prominent without dominating the front end, the teardrop headlights are elegant, and the tails have been made more conventional-looking, after the existing sedan&#8217;s odd rear-end structure. I&#8217;d still prefer a hatch, as Europeans get, but this works decently as a three-box design.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">The Gran Coupe measures seven-tenths of an inch longer and an inch taller than the outgoing model, but the wheelbase and width are the same. The sedan&#8217;s tacked on some mass in this new generation—117 pounds, to be precise—with the all-wheel-drive variant tipping the scales at 3,578 pounds. All trims employ the two-liter TwinPower turbo four-cylinder, which in base guise improves to 241 horsepower (up 13 hp) and a formidable 295 lb-ft of torque (up 37 lb-ft). Step up to the M235, and you get 312 hp (up 11 hp), while torque remains unchanged. That&#8217;s good for 0-60 mph in just 4.7 seconds—not bad for a little Bimmer. Both are mated to the latest-generation seven-speed Steptronic dual-clutch transmission.</p>    <figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-6 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="2560" height="1707" loading="lazy" data-id="6466244" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/P90572411_highRes-copy-1.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85&#038;w=2560" alt="" class="wp-image-6466244" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="2560" height="1706" loading="lazy" data-id="6466183" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/P90572432_highRes-copy.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6466183" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="2560" height="1707" loading="lazy" data-id="6466237" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/P90572431_highRes-copy.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6466237" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="2560" height="1708" loading="lazy" data-id="6466238" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/P90572361_highRes-copy.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6466238" /></figure> <figcaption class="blocks-gallery-caption wp-element-caption"><em>BMW, Fabian Kirchbauer</em></figcaption></figure>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">The M235 also receives M Adaptive Suspension, for a supple or hard-charging ride when you want either. In fact, BMW is making a big deal out of optimizations to the 2 Gran Coupe&#8217;s chassis, touting new shock absorber tech that reduces roll during spirited driving, plus preloaded anti-roll bar mounts and a very rigid rear axle to sharpen dynamics, among a suite of enhancements. Customers can add M Compound brakes, which comprise four-piston, fixed calipers with 15.2-inch drilled rotors up front; and single-piston, floating calipers with 13-inch discs out back.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Inside, the new 2 Gran Coupe looks relatively sparse, as many modern cabins do, but also unique. The tri-color M-themed stitched stripes across the dash work better than I would&#8217;ve guessed, and the HVAC vents showcase one of the most inventive uses of BMW&#8217;s kidney motif I&#8217;ve seen yet. (And BMW&#8217;s done <em>a lot </em>with those shapes over the years.) A pair of roughly 10-inch displays form the instrument cluster and infotainment interfaces across a curved panel, and BMW points out that a 12-speaker Harmon/Kardon premium sound system now comes standard with every 2 Gran Coupe. Wireless device charging and auto-dimming mirrors both inside and outside the cabin are also standard equipment.</p>    <figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-7 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="2560" height="1708" loading="lazy" data-id="6466188" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/P90572374_highRes-copy.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6466188" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="2560" height="1708" loading="lazy" data-id="6466193" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/P90572381_highRes-copy.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85&#038;w=2560" alt="" class="wp-image-6466193" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="2560" height="1698" loading="lazy" data-id="6466190" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/P90572440_highRes-copy.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85&#038;w=2560" alt="" class="wp-image-6466190" /></figure> <figcaption class="blocks-gallery-caption wp-element-caption"><em>BMW, Fabian Kirchbauer</em></figcaption></figure>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Note the seats, which are made not of leather, but cruelty-free &#8220;Veganza.&#8221; I could&#8217;ve sworn Veganza was a psoriasis drug, but nope, turns out it&#8217;s upholstery. Whatever it is, it looks good. Appearances aside, so far BMW has only provided images of the M235&#8217;s interior, and as everyone knows, the true mark of a well-designed cabin is how good the base model looks, sans bells and whistles. We&#8217;ll just have to wait and see about that.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">While the 2 Gran Coupe is often overshadowed by its sibling in name only, I&#8217;d reckon that the second-gen deserves more than passive acknowledgment. The M235 may come in 13 ponies shy of the <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/car-reviews/2023-audi-s3-review-specs-price-options-impressions">Audi S3</a>, but it&#8217;s a match where torque&#8217;s concerned, and both rely on front-biased all-wheel drive. I&#8217;d love to know how they compare, and we&#8217;ll hopefully get our chance in the coming months.</p>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="2560" height="1440" loading="lazy" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/P90572406_highRes-copy.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6466235" /></figure>    <p class="article-paragraph skip"><em>Got tips?

Back in 2021, company CEO Carlos Tavares gave every one of its struggling makes an ultimatum: <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/40582/stellantis-ceo-says-chrysler-other-struggling-brands-will-have-10-years-to-prove-worth">get it together within a decade, or clear out your offices</a>. Well, the first round of performance reviews is coming up soon, and they could bring some difficult &#8220;decisions&#8221; about the future of brands like <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/category/chrysler-news">Chrysler</a>.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">So said Tavares at this year&#8217;s Paris Motor Show, as recorded by <a href="https://www.autonews.com/executives/stellantis-ceo-carlos-tavares-successor-decide-brand-closures" rel="nofollow"><em>Automotive News</em></a>. Tavares indicated that Stellantis will check in on individual brands about two-thirds of the way through its Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan, when viable marques will be separated from those that aren&#8217;t. He pointed to a timeframe about two to three years from now, or around the end of the five-year period during which the brands&#8217; turnarounds are fully financed.</p>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1620" height="1080" loading="lazy" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/CH025_003PFot6euc89vfrs5uum77opf2kn3m.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="2025 Chrysler Pacifica" class="wp-image-6466215" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">2025 Chrysler Pacifica Pinnacle. <em>Chrysler</em> Stellantis</figcaption></figure>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">“We will review each brand&#8217;s performance at about two-thirds of the way through the Dare Forward 2030 plan, so you could expect decisions in two to three years,” Tavares told <em>AN</em>. “So far we delivered on our commitments. We already launched the STLA Medium platform, which debuted with the Peugeot 3008 and, when needed, we re-scheduled some product launches due to changing conditions, but we did not cancel any.&#8221;</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">What those decisions are wasn&#8217;t specified by Tavares, but it&#8217;s not certain that he&#8217;s talking about culling any makes so soon. Initially, the CEO suggested the brands would have until at least 2030 to prove their worth, so this milestone may instead mark the point when Stellantis decides to allocate further resources to brands under pressure. <em>The Drive</em> reached out to the company for clarification but did not receive a response at the time of publication.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">In any case, the call is expected to fall on Tavares&#8217; successor, now that the executive has announced a decision to retire after his contract ends in early 2026. Stellantis will name his replacement before the end of next year.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Chrysler is one of the most imperiled companies in Stellantis&#8217; portfolio, with only two models and no clear roadmap to recovery. One is the <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/chrysler-pacifica-hybrid-fires-actually-increased-after-recall-nhtsa">Pacifica</a> minivan, while the other is a continuation of the last-gen Pacifica rebadged as the <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/42674/chryslers-cheap-voyager-minivan-might-be-fleet-only-next-year">Voyager</a>. While <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/category/chrysler-reviews">Chrysler</a> seemingly planned to roll out an electric crossover styled after the Airflow concept, <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/chrysler-is-trashing-the-airflow-ev-concept-and-starting-over">poor reception drove it to restart from a clean slate</a>. The result was the more promising Halcyon concept, which, if anything, <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/the-chrysler-halcyon-is-an-ev-concept-that-looks-nothing-like-a-chrysler">looks far too radical for Chrysler to actually sell</a>. Then again, rumors a while back pointed to <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/chrysler-300-wont-die-but-itll-turn-into-an-ev-in-2026-report">a Chrysler twin to the Charger Daytona EV</a>, and the Halcyon at least looks like the right shape to be that car.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">If it is, then it could signal a return to the days of its namesake—or at least send Chrysler out with a bang.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip"><em>Got a tip or question for the author?

While speaking to <a href="https://www.carexpert.com.au/car-news/toyota-supra-here-to-stay-says-local-exec" rel="nofollow"><em>Car Expert</em>,</a> Toyota Australia&#8217;s Vice President of Sales, Marketing, and Franchise Operations Sean Hanley confirmed that the <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/car-reviews/2024-toyota-gr-supra-review">Supra</a> &#8220;brand&#8221; isn&#8217;t going anywhere anytime soon. However, he was a bit hazy on whether that meant the continuation of this model or if the Supra name is going to stick around for future models.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">“There is no plan to discontinue the Supra brand in this car company. I know that,”Hanley said.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">While that&#8217;s pretty vague, Hanley did say that just because BMW might be killing off the Z4—the Supra&#8217;s mechanical twin—in 2026, that doesn&#8217;t mean Toyota will kill off the Supra, too. He didn&#8217;t specifically say it won&#8217;t, either. &#8220;BMW is not Toyota. The notion that Supra is stopping is purely speculative,&#8221; he said. “And, quite frankly, I have no expectation, sitting here today, that the Supra brand will disappear. At all.”</p>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img width="1920" height="1080" loading="lazy" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-toyota-supra-1.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85&#038;w=1920" alt="" class="wp-image-6466226" style="width: 1024px;height: auto" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Toyota</em> </figcaption></figure>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Thankfully, Hanley recognizes the importance of the Supra name to the Toyota brand. Even if this current A90 generation Supra does come to an end in 2026, we shouldn&#8217;t have to wait 22 years for the next one, as we did after the fourth generation.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">“The Supra nameplate goes back for years. There is a lot of legacy there. It is an incredibly important brand,”Hanley said. “If you get it right, people will start to gravitate to your brand and go ‘Wow, that’s a fun brand. They are doing well, they know what they’re doing.’”</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">It&#8217;d be nice if A90 Supra stuck around for a few more years. It&#8217;s still as good-looking as it was when it first launched and it&#8217;s one of the more entertaining sports cars in its price range. It&#8217;s also one of the few cars on sale that pares a <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/car-reviews/2025-bmw-z4-vs-2024-toyota-gr-supra-manual-review">straight-six engine with a six-speed manual </a>and rear-wheel drive. But if 2026 is the year it dies, it&#8217;s refreshing to know that Toyota values the Supra nameplate and should replace it with another one. Let&#8217;s just hope it doesn&#8217;t take another two decades to do so.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip"><em>Got tips?

It&#8217;s known by several names: The LL8, Vortec 4200, or more colloquially, the Ameri-Barra. The latter draws on a comparison to <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/42678/old-aussie-work-van-gets-1100-hp-barra-motor-and-seating-for-7">the mighty Barra I6</a> that Ford sold for years in Australia. Tuners love that thing, and given the GM engine&#8217;s similarity, American performance nuts like Calvin Nelson are using it for some crazy-high-power builds.

Just so you know, he also has a Vortec 4200-powered <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/turbo-ford-300-i6-flirts-with-1000-hp-in-9-second-fairmont-wagon">Ford Fairmont wagon</a> that&#8217;ll run 8s in the quarter-mile. He&#8217;s plenty familiar with these inline-sixes as he&#8217;s put them in several other cars before. The Camaro we&#8217;re talking about here might be my favorite because instead of swapping an LS <em>into it</em>, he swapped an LS3 <em>out of it.</em></p>    <figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-8 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="3718" height="2158" loading="lazy" data-id="6466213" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screen-Shot-2024-10-15-at-2.30.47-PM.png?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6466213" /></figure> <figcaption class="blocks-gallery-caption wp-element-caption"><em>Nivlac57 via YouTube</em></figcaption></figure>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">The American Supra-type project is obviously tuned up to make that much power. Nelson mentions in the video that it&#8217;s running Molnar connecting rods and Diamond pistons in addition to a head ported by Snyder Performance, Schneider Racing 66RH camshafts, Crower valve springs, and ARP head studs as well as main studs. The head gasket, crankshaft, and main caps are stock, impressively.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">As for the turbo, it&#8217;s a VS Racing 8082 unit that&#8217;s plumbed up with <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/getting-this-turbo-ford-300-i6-with-an-ls-head-to-run-took-years">modified LS headers</a>. Nelson has used this blower throughout the build&#8217;s evolution, running it first at 9 psi and making right around 398 hp at the wheels—not too shabby for a starting point. Bumping boost up to 13 psi yielded a 47-hp improvement to 445 whp, and now, he believes it&#8217;s the limiting factor in making more power. More on that in a second.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Nelson reckoned they&#8217;d need to crank the boost up to 38 pounds to break the 1,000-hp mark. He was pretty close, as it turns out a 4.2-liter Chevy Trailblazer engine with these mods needs 39 psi and some additional ignition timing to do it. That&#8217;s just plain crazy, especially when you remember these aren&#8217;t crank hp figures—they&#8217;re measured at the wheel.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Just listen to it spool at 7,400 rpm:</p>    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHAlz4y6DYY"><div class="lazied-youtube-frame" data-video-id="nHAlz4y6DYY" data-iframe-classes="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"> 	<img class="lazied-youtube-frame-thumbnail" loading="lazy" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nHAlz4y6DYY/hqdefault.jpg" />  	 		 		 	 </div></a>   	        <p class="article-paragraph skip">It took a few tries to hit the mark, and as Nelson explains, they&#8217;re fighting some serious backpressure. But seeing how well this package performed—even the intercooler that&#8217;s only rated for 800 hp—is super encouraging. There&#8217;s no telling how much further it can go, but I&#8217;ll tell you this: I&#8217;m excited to learn.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Maybe I ought to start shopping around&#8230;</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip"><em>Got a tip or question for the author?

                <img src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/porsche-911-gt3-1.jpg?quality=85"> <p class="article-paragraph skip">An updated <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/category/porsche-news">Porsche</a> 911 GT3 is on the way, to go along with the rest of the 992.2-generation 911 lineup. While the official reveal isn&#8217;t until Friday, October 18, Porsche decided to kick off the countdown with a teaser of its upcoming sports car. The shadowy silhouette of the facelifted GT3 may look a lot like the outgoing gen&#8217;s, but you can expect a few changes for what could be the model&#8217;s final act with a pure internal combustion powertrain.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">In the teaser, you&#8217;ll note a very familiar <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/new-porsche-911-gt3-kit-from-manthey-racing-costs-57300-and-is-factory-warrantied">992 GT3</a> shape, with its signature swan-neck rear wing. Given that the GT3 is about aerodynamic performance, don&#8217;t be surprised if it has a different fascia than the 992.2 Carrera GTS.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">On the flip side, one similarity the upcoming GT3 could share with the GTS is a new digital gauge cluster, and that means once again saying goodbye to Porsche&#8217;s beloved analog tachometer. While Porsche purists were <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/the-2025-porsche-911-isnt-even-pretending-to-be-analog-anymore">dismayed about the GTS&#8217; dials going all-digital</a>, GT3 buyers are even more discerning when it comes to analog experiences, and will probably be even more furious. Another controversial change could be the implementation of a push-button starter, as the 992.2 models seen thus far have replaced the old twist knob with a button. Thankfully, it&#8217;s at least to the left of the steering wheel, as all Porsche starters should be.</p>    <figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-9 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1920" height="1081" loading="lazy" data-id="6466154" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/911_Carrera_RG24_0075-3__Displays_Kopie.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6466154" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1920" height="1080" loading="lazy" data-id="6466153" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/911_Carrera_RG24_0080_1.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6466153" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="2122" height="1193" loading="lazy" data-id="6466147" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/24_PAG_G188_911_Vorshooting_1001__A3_RGB-copy-1.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6466147" /></figure> <figcaption class="blocks-gallery-caption wp-element-caption">At top, interior photos of the 2024 911 Carrera—note the digital instrument cluster and push-button start. At bottom, the 2024 Porsche 911 Carrera GTS &#8220;T-Hybrid.&#8221; <em>Porsche</em></figcaption></figure>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Porsche says it will launch two model variants at the same time, so we&#8217;re putting money on the 911 GT3 Touring to also debut Friday. There are a few differences between the trims—the most notable is the Touring&#8217;s lack of a rear wing—but they&#8217;re mechanically very similar. The teaser also seems to show off a roll cage in the rear of the cabin, possibly hinting at a more extreme track package.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Now that the 992.2 911 <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/car-reviews/2025-porsche-911-carrera-gts-first-drive-review">Carrera GTS is a hybrid</a>, there&#8217;s some worry that the new GT3 will go hybrid as well. For what it&#8217;s worth, there have been spy videos of the new GT3 lapping the Nürburgring without any hybrid test vehicle badges. So it would seem that this next rendition is going to retain combustion exclusivity, for now.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Both versions of the track-tested 911 will be presented by racing drivers Walter Röhrl and Jörg Bergmeister, who assuredly will be keen to share their driving impressions. The premiere happens on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_BaxRhNREI_V0DVXjXDALA" rel="nofollow">Porsche&#8217;s YouTube channel</a> this coming Friday, at 12:30 p.m. Eastern.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip"><em>Got tips?

                <img src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/deals-1015-powerbanks.jpg?quality=85"> <p class="article-paragraph skip">When I leave the house, I always have a smartphone and <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/guides-and-gear/garmin-instinct-2x-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">smartwatch</a>; that&#8217;s the minimum. Having the ability to keep them charged is a necessity. I&#8217;ve found some great deals on <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/guides-and-gear/dji-power-1000-solar-generator-hands-on-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">power banks </a>for keeping them powered up no matter where you are. Some of these power banks will fit in your pocket and will top off a phone. Others fit in an EDC bag and will provide several full charges that could keep you going for several days in an emergency.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">I&#8217;ve had a variety of power banks over the years for my smartphones. Whether it was to keep them charged through hours and hours of international travel or surviving an entire day of posting news from auto shows, I feel like they&#8217;ve been an integral part of my work kit for a couple of decades. Someday I&#8217;ll tell you kids the story of the time I was at the Geneva Autoshow and had to type all my stories on a Blackberry. Anyway, of the dozens I&#8217;ve had, all but a few very recent ones are trash. My advice, buy ruggedized power banks if you intend to use them hard. This <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ELECOM-Portable-15000mAh-Waterproof-Shockproof/dp/B0BX364B54/?tag=drive09e6-20" rel="nofollow">ELECOM NESTOUT rugged power bank</a> has 15,000 mAh worth of battery cells in it and is on sale for $52.99 on Amazon. It looks like a canteen for making mixed drinks, but also looks nearly bullet proof.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/myCharge-AdventurePlus-Waterproof-Accessories-Bluetooth/dp/B07XLN3SQM/?tag=drive09e6-20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">myCharge 6,700 mAh</a> unit looks less tactical, but equally as rugged. Both of these are waterproof and the myCharge is only $35.99 with coupon. And, a little more divisive, for $49.99 is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/DEWALT-10-000mAh-Powerbank-Portable/dp/B09S4RD82T/?tag=drive09e6-20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">DeWalt portable charger</a>. It looks like something a company would give out as a promotion. I think that&#8217;s cool. Some people may not want to pay a premium to feel like they&#8217;re advertising for DeWalt. Especially if their allegiance lies with a different brand.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Usually, I like power banks that just have USB ports and I can provide whatever cables are required on my own. If a built-in cable breaks or becomes obsolete, it takes down the whole power bank. This <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-45800mAh-Charging-Flashlights-Carabiner/dp/B0BGX8Y62Y/?tag=drive09e6-20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GOODaaa apocalypse preparedness unit</a> is a whole different ballgame. Its goal is to be a self-contained unit that charges itself with solar or even a hand crank if necessary, so I feel the integrated cables are justified. Below that, I&#8217;ve posted a few different sizes and use case models of Anker power banks. These are all discounted, so it closes the gap between these and lower quality brands. I have a number of Anker products, and they&#8217;re all top-notch.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">The last power bank I have listed is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/AstroAI-Starter-Battery-Portable-Flashlight/dp/B0CB3W9FRD/?tag=drive09e6-20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">AstroAI unit</a>, which also happens to be a car jump starter as well. If you keep a power bank in your car, it may as well be able to jump-start it. I have one of these and I&#8217;ve used it several times for powering devices through USB. It even includes an adapter so you can use it to power devices that plug into 12v sockets. And at the very bottom, is for when the excreta impinges the rotary oscillator. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Messenger-Satellite-Communicator-Messaging/dp/B0BFBZR4KW/?tag=drive09e6-20" rel="nofollow">Garmin inReach Messenger handheld satellite communicator</a> for $252.47 will get you out of a jam when you can&#8217;t make contact with anyone, no matter how charged your phone is.</p>    <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-deals-on-power-banks">More Deals on

                <img src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/gm-defense-tactical-vehicle-2.jpg?quality=85"> <p class="article-paragraph skip">GM Defense wants to offer United States soldiers a stealthier way of getting around combat zones. At its core, the Next Gen tactical vehicle is a heavily modified Chevrolet <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/car-reviews/2024-chevy-silverado-hd-review-specs-price-options-impressions">Silverado 2500</a> ZR2 with a ton of armor. However, unlike the off-road truck civilians can buy, this one runs on electricity supplied by a battery and diesel generator. </p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Powering GM’s new tactical vehicle are two electric motors—one at each axle—with a 12-module battery pack wired up. A 2.8-liter Duramax turbo-diesel keeps the batteries juiced, making this like a military-grade <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/new-cars/4668/the-2017-chevrolet-volt-might-be-the-worlds-best-commuter-car">Chevrolet Volt</a>. While GM Defense didn’t provide any power specs, it should be enough to haul the bespoke armored body, up to six passengers, and all of the gear that military personnel might need.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">And because it&#8217;s based on the ZR2 model, it gets all of GM&#8217;s best four-wheeling upgrades like <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/why-the-2024-chevy-silverado-hd-zr2-sticks-to-ifs-and-multimatic-dampers">Multimatic DSSV shocks</a>.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">With its electrified powertrain and diesel range extender, GM Defense claims the new tactical vehicle has improved range and mission duration versus its traditional counterpart. It also reduces fuel-supply logistics and still uses the same JP8 fuel as most other military vehicles, so it fits into the current fuel infrastructure. </p>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1920" height="1080" loading="lazy" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/gm-defense-tactical-vehicle-1.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85&#038;w=1920" alt="" class="wp-image-6466042" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>GM Defense</em> </figcaption></figure>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Most importantly, though, GM Defense’s new electrified pickup is much harder to detect than traditional military vehicles. Its Silent Drive mode, which presumably cuts the diesel engine and allows it to run solely on battery power, provides soldiers with a tactical advantage. Additionally, its Silent Watch technology makes it harder to detect with thermal imaging. Again, GM didn’t provide specs for how long it can operate without the diesel engine running but I guess that isn’t information we need to know. It’s also information that the Department of Defense might not want public. GM Defense also prepared it for automation, so it’s ready for unmanned operation if needed. </p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Despite being a military vehicle, there are some features you’d expect in a normal road car, like ABS, stability control, and a 360-degree camera system. GM Defense also offers armor add-ons, too, and the thought of the DoD shopping for these things and picking out armor like we pick out rubber floor mats is funny to me. “Yes, we’ll take the frag grenade underbody protection, please. Also, one 50-caliber mounted machine gun. Oh, and the wireless phone charger, please. Is the Apple CarPlay wireless or wired? OK, wired. Thanks.”</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">This new GM Defense tactical vehicle is available in two-, four-, and six-seat configurations and will be revealed at the AUSA 2024—the annual meeting and exposition of the Association of the U.S. Army—which runs October 14-16.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip"><em>Got tips?

With a power figure like that, 200 miles per hour was a given, and the real question became how much higher it could go. We have our answer now, because <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/accelerator/21316/gm-executive-mark-reuss-issues-apology-for-crashing-chevy-corvette-zr1">General Motors President Mark Reuss</a> just drove the mid-engined machine 233 mph on a test track in Germany.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">That top speed was measured as a two-way average on the northbound and southbound straightaways at Automotive Testing Papenburg&#8217;sHigh-Speed Oval Track. Importantly, GM notes it wasn&#8217;t a fluke result. Five engineers also cracked the 230-mph mark in both Corvette ZR1 test vehicles onsite.</p>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="2400" height="1500" loading="lazy" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/809.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6466058" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>General Motors</em> </figcaption></figure>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">The specifics of the run are as follows: They used the ZR1&#8217;s specially developed Top Speed Mode (sick) to go 233 mph at redline in sixth gear with an engineer in the passenger seat. <a href="https://news.gm.com/home.detail.html/Pages/topic/us/en/2024/oct/1015-zr1-barber.html" rel="nofollow">GM says the car was factory-stock</a>, and it wore the standard aero package with Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires and aluminum wheels. As for that drive mode, it adjusts the chassis control systems for maximum speed. It&#8217;s reserved for closed-course driving, and you&#8217;d best believe that&#8217;s the only place anyone should try hitting speeds this high.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">“We actually didn’t think 233 was in the cards,” Corvette ZR1 lead development engineer Chris Barber said following the test. “That’s part of the reason everyone was so excited. Not only did we meet the target, we did better. It speaks to the confidence the car provides, how easy it felt for us to do something that sounds just insane.</p>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1280" height="853" loading="lazy" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/887.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6466059" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>General Motors</em> </figcaption></figure>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">“We’ve done some cool stuff, but I’ve never seen the group so ecstatic. Having Mark Reuss there as the driver just added to it,&#8221; Barber continued. &#8220;We’re proud as the Corvette team, but to have Mark be so involved speaks to the importance of what this means. This is a pretty historic thing.”</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">GM can now add a few more line items to the Corvette ZR1&#8217;s list of accomplishments. It was already the most powerful American V8 production car from a major automaker, thanks to <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/heres-why-the-chevy-corvette-zr1-couldnt-go-turbo-until-now">the twin-turbo, 5.5-liter flat-plane crank LT7</a>. Those BorgWarner blowers are also <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/the-chevy-corvette-zr1s-twin-turbos-are-the-largest-ever-fitted-to-a-production-car">the largest twin turbos</a> ever fitted to a car for sale to the public. The runs at Papenburg have now proven the ZR1 as the fastest under $1 million. While Chevrolet hasn&#8217;t announced pricing yet, it&#8217;s expected to land somewhere between $180,000 and $200,000. That&#8217;s far from cheap, but then again, this car is far from slow. Here&#8217;s the high-speed run for proof:</p>     <figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">  </div></figure>    <p class="article-paragraph skip"><em>Got a tip or question for the author?

                <img src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/R0000797-copy.jpg?quality=85"> <p class="article-paragraph skip">Branding matters. If you’ve got any doubt, take a look at the current <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/new-cars/44129/2022-subaru-wrx-review-grown-up-but-still-down-to-clown" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Subaru WRX</a> lineup, which consists of five trims, none labeled STI. The <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/car-reviews/2024-subaru-wrx-tr-first-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WRX TR</a> joined the fray last year, giving fans a bit more of—though, crucially, not <em>all</em> of—what they’ve been pining for. The story behind the <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/2025-wrx-ts-once-again-proves-subaru-will-do-anything-but-make-a-new-sti" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2025 Subaru WRX tS</a> isn’t all that different. In fact, I’m getting a little tired of telling it.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">For starters, <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/car-reviews/2024-subaru-brz-ts-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tS means “Tuned by STI.”</a> And indeed, the WRX tS has more of the attributes of a theoretical <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/44763/subaru-killed-the-new-wrx-sti-because-of-regulations-it-says" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WRX STI</a> without actually being one. That means the TR’s six-piston front, two-piston rear Brembo brakes, and Bridgestone Potenza S007 high-performance summer tires riding on lovely matte-gray 19-inch wheels have come along for the ride. It also means the range-topping GT’s adaptive suspension is here too, with exclusive custom damping rates courtesy of Subaru Tecnica International, in addition to that trim’s changeable drive modes.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Those are the headline additions, though the tS offers a little more. You’ve got the first fully digital gauge cluster ever in a WRX, as well as a special blue-trimmed version of the sport sedan’s signature body-hugging Recaros. They look great, though they sort of clash with any exterior color that isn’t blue or neutral, like our Galaxy Purple Pearl example here. It’s a new shade for the tS, and I dig it.</p>    <figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-10 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"> <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="2560" height="1706" loading="lazy" data-id="6465898" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Subaru-WRX-TS_03.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6465898" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="2560" height="1706" loading="lazy" data-id="6465897" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Subaru-WRX-TS_33.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6465897" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="2560" height="1440" loading="lazy" data-id="6465895" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Subaru-WRX-TS_25.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6465895" /></figure> <figcaption class="blocks-gallery-caption wp-element-caption">2025 Subaru WRX tS in Galaxy Purple Pearl. <em>Adam Ismail</em></figcaption></figure>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">While we’re on the topic of design, it’s true that the tS looks pretty much like every other WRX, and chances are you either love or hate that. Eagle-eyed readers will notice the cherry blossom-pink badges, denoting STI’s involvement, as well as a subtle Crystal Black Silica finish for all of the exterior trim that would normally be piano black. It sparkles a little in sunlight, and I dig that, too.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Heading inside, we <em>should </em>touch on the new 12.3-inch LCD panel in the gauge cluster—though I’m surprised how little there is to say about it. The circular speedo and tach graphics are steely and skeuomorphic like a 2011 iPhone app, while the information that used to be crammed into a tiny vertical screen between the dials on other trims is now spread across that diagonal foot of real estate.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">There are two other interfaces: One focuses on either Apple Maps (no support for Google Maps, unfortunately) or built-in navigation while the other eliminates almost everything to showcase EyeSight’s driver-assist tech at work. You can also toggle through a number of widgets in the lower-left corner of the screen, showing information like boost, tire pressure, fuel economy, and so on.</p>    <figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-11 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="2560" height="1707" loading="lazy" data-id="6465904" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Subaru-WRX-TS_12.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85&#038;w=2560" alt="" class="wp-image-6465904" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="2560" height="1707" loading="lazy" data-id="6465903" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Subaru-WRX-TS_38.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6465903" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="2560" height="1707" loading="lazy" data-id="6465902" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Subaru-WRX-TS_13.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6465902" /></figure> <figcaption class="blocks-gallery-caption wp-element-caption"><em>Adam Ismail</em></figcaption></figure>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">And… that’s pretty much it. No rearranging readouts, no big horizontal tach or shift lights as you get in the Civic Type R—not even an enlarged current gear indicator to replace the extremely small one easily obscured by the steering column. I don’t hate screens as much as some of my colleagues, but I at least expect them to be used to the fullest extent, and so far <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/category/subaru-reviews" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Subaru’s</a> gone all-digital for limited benefit.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Having said that, nobody will buy the WRX tS for its extra screen—they’ll buy it for its chassis. And those adjustable dampers are excellent. Restricting them to the CVT-only GT trim always felt like trolling, and it’s nice that the 83% of WRX buyers that choose manual, per Subaru, can now have variable damper stiffness, too. All three of the suspension modes on the tS—Comfort, Normal, and Sport—exhibit higher damping force than on the GT. Compared to the TR, which already had stiffer springs than a normal WRX, pitch under hard acceleration and braking has been reduced by 55%, and roll by 30%.</p>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="2560" height="1707" loading="lazy" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025_Subaru_WRX_tS_092-copy.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85&#038;w=2560" alt="" class="wp-image-6465942" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">2025 Subaru WRX tS in Sapphire Blue Pearl. <p class="article-paragraph skip"><em>Subaru</em></p> </figcaption></figure>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">That all sounds great on paper, but you feel it in practice, too. In Comfort mode, the WRX tS isn’t easily upset by train tracks or crumbling thoroughfares. I’d go so far as to call the ride supple—for a high-performance compact, anyway. Cycling up the modes, Normal achieves a decent balance, and Sport is uncompromising, for those times you find yourself on a freshly repaved road course. Like Sonoma Raceway!</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">The 12-turn, 2.5-mile circuit was the ideal place to sample the optimized dynamics of the WRX tS, with its hilly first sector defined by blind, off-camber corners; the sweeping, downhill Turns 5 and 6; and those quick esses on the back end. Sonoma’s got a little bit of everything, and the WRX tS can keep up—thanks not only to the new suspension but also to those beefy Brembos shared with the TR, plus the customizable steering.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">I never clicked with the regular WRX’s effortlessly light steering feel, and the tS completely addresses that. Just like with the suspension, STI adjusted all of the steering profiles on the tS to be at least slightly heavier than they are on the GT. For the track, where you need every movement to be deliberate, with as much feedback as possible, it makes a big difference.</p>    <figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-12 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="2560" height="1707" loading="lazy" data-id="6465946" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025_Subaru_WRX_tS_112-copy.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6465946" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="2560" height="1707" loading="lazy" data-id="6465945" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025_Subaru_WRX_tS_114-copy.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6465945" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="2560" height="1707" loading="lazy" data-id="6465951" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025_Subaru_WRX_tS_129-copy.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85&#038;w=2560" alt="" class="wp-image-6465951" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="2560" height="1706" loading="lazy" data-id="6465940" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025_Subaru_WRX_tS_109-copy.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6465940" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="2560" height="1440" loading="lazy" data-id="6465937" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025_Subaru_WRX_tS_102-copy.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6465937" /></figure> <figcaption class="blocks-gallery-caption wp-element-caption">2025 Subaru WRX tS in World Rally Blue Pearl. <em>Subaru</em></figcaption></figure>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">So then, the WRX tS is the sum of its welcome refinements—surely the best WRX of its generation so far. But of course, some things haven’t changed. You still can’t get any WRX from the factory, including a tS, with a mechanical limited-slip differential. And the tS doesn’t offer any improvements on the powertrain side of things, either: merely the same 2.4-liter flat-four, with its 271 horsepower, 258 lb-ft of torque, and burble-less drone at cruising speeds.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">That’s a real shame because the WRX could absolutely use more pep. Those numbers aren’t awful, but they don’t get you quite as far when you’re lugging around 3,430 pounds, which happens to be how much a modern WRX weighs. What&#8217;s more, the FA24F engine doesn’t have a torque curve—it’s more like a torque plateau that rides from 2,000 all the way to 5,200 rpm, before redline hits in a hurry at all but 6,100 rpm.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">In other words, there’s never a moment where the WRX wallops you with power. Boost feels like it rolls in—maybe not quite as early as advertised—and hangs around without really introducing itself. Technically, I suppose that’s… optimal? Efficient? Predictable? It could be all of those things, but it isn’t dramatic, at least with just shy of 260 lb-ft on tap.</p>    <figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-13 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="2560" height="1706" loading="lazy" data-id="6465909" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Subaru-WRX-TS_20.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6465909" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="2560" height="1707" loading="lazy" data-id="6465907" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Subaru-WRX-TS_08.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6465907" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="2560" height="1707" loading="lazy" data-id="6465900" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Subaru-WRX-TS_19.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6465900" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="2560" height="1707" loading="lazy" data-id="6465905" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Subaru-WRX-TS_09.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6465905" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="2560" height="1707" loading="lazy" data-id="6465906" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Subaru-WRX-TS_28.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6465906" /></figure> <figcaption class="blocks-gallery-caption wp-element-caption"><em>Adam Ismail</em></figcaption></figure>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">That’s the best and likely most expensive WRX you’ll be able to buy next year. I say “likely” because Subaru doesn’t plan to share pricing until November, but it isn’t hard to make an educated guess as to where it’ll wind up. The WRX TR, which has less equipment, starts at $42,775. For comparison’s sake, a mid-grade <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/2025-toyota-gr-corolla-starts-at-40000-now-and-the-auto-doesnt-come-cheap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Toyota GR Corolla</a> will set you back $200 less than that; it has more power and torque than any WRX but no adaptive dampers and poorer brakes than the tS. Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/car-reviews/2023-honda-civic-type-r-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Honda Civic Type R</a> starts at $46,690, and the <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/new-cars/2022-vw-golf-r-review-specs-price-driving-impressions-hot-hatchbacks-volkswagen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Golf R</a> at $46,890 (in 2024, anyway—VW hasn’t come through with ‘25 pricing, either). The WRX range begins at $33,855 and, as I said after <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/car-reviews/2024-subaru-wrx-tr-first-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I drove the TR last year</a>, I still believe the Premium trim for a few grand more will remain the value move.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Context aside, it’s safe to assume that the WRX tS will be a mid-$40K car. I know <em>so</em> much has changed in the last five years, but the prior-gen WRX STI started at $38,170 in its final, 2021 guise. There’s no question the tS will be the finest WRX that Subaru will sell in 2025. But it’ll also cost STI money without STI power, let alone power to match its fiercest rivals.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">With the tS, Subaru has optimized just about every component of the WRX experience, save for one. But those improvements haven’t only sharpened the sports sedan—they’ve also made its flaws more glaring than ever. Until they’re addressed, this could well be as good as it’s going to get.</p>    <figure class="wp-block-table"><table><thead><tr><th></th><th><strong>2025 Subaru WRX tS Specs</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Estimated Price</strong></td><td>Around $45,000</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Powertrain</strong></td><td>2.4-liter turbocharged flat-four | 6-speed manual | all-wheel drive</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Horsepower</strong></td><td>271 @ 5,600 rpm</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Torque</strong></td><td>258 lb-ft @ 2,000 to 5,200 rpm</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Seating Capacity</strong></td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Curb Weight</strong></td><td>3,430 pounds</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Cargo Volume</strong></td><td>12.5 cubic feet</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ground Clearance</strong></td><td>5.4 inches</td></tr><tr><td><strong>0-60 mph (2024 TR; tS TBA)</strong></td><td>5.5 seconds</td></tr><tr><td><strong>EPA Fuel Economy (2024 TR; tS TBA)</strong></td><td>19 mpg city | 26 highway</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Quick Take</strong></td><td>The WRX tS inches the sport sedan closer to its rivals, and toward a true STI.

                <img src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Website_ProductPageBanner-T598-1920x1080-2-copy.jpg?quality=85"> <p class="article-paragraph skip">Thrustmaster has packaged the same technology found in many high-performance hybrids and EVs into a new direct-drive sim-racing wheel called the T598. Compatible with PlayStation and Windows, the wheel relies on an <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/features/why-axial-flux-motors-are-the-key-to-small-fun-evs">axial-flux motor</a> to deliver more accurate feedback in a compact footprint.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">While the idea of a direct-drive steering wheel isn&#8217;t new, the T598 is the first fitted with an axial-flux motor; <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/fanatec-gran-turismo-dd-extreme-sim-racing-review">other models</a> from brands like <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/sim-racing-giant-fanatec-was-in-shambles-heres-how-corsair-plans-to-fix-it">Fanatec</a> use radial-flux motors. With an axial-flux motor, the magnetic flux is parallel to the shaft; in a radial-flux motor, the magnetic flux is <em>perpendicular</em> to the shaft. Changing the direction of the flux makes the wheel&#8217;s rotation smoother by eliminating &#8220;cogging,&#8221; which is the notchy feeling felt by players when the magnets and the coils aren&#8217;t perfectly aligned. It also improves response time, and allows the entire drive system to fit into a smaller, flatter package, compared to the long and barrel-shaped construction of radial-flux motors.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">If the technology sounds familiar, that&#8217;s because the latest electrified supercars, like the <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/car-reviews/2025-mclaren-artura-spider-first-drive-review">McLaren Artura</a>, also utilize axial-flux motors for their superb power density. In the Artura&#8217;s case, the motor sits within the bell housing of the gearbox and contributes 94 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque, even though it weighs just 34 pounds. A radial-flux motor would&#8217;ve tacked on unwanted mass and possibly even lengthened the car&#8217;s wheelbase.</p>    <figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-15 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1580" height="960" loading="lazy" data-id="6465992" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Website_ProductPageUTH-T598-1580x960-1-copy-1.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6465992" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1620" height="1080" loading="lazy" data-id="6465993" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Website_ProductPageGallery-T598-1920x1080-2-copy-1.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6465993" /></figure>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1920" height="1080" loading="lazy" data-id="6465991" src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Website_ProductPageGallery-T598-1920x1080-3-copy-1.jpg?strip=all&#038;quality=85" alt="" class="wp-image-6465991" /></figure> <figcaption class="blocks-gallery-caption wp-element-caption"><em>Thrustmaster</em></figcaption></figure>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">As for the T598&#8217;s power output, it generates a consistent 5 Nm—in line with Fanatec&#8217;s popular CSL DD—but can also boost that up to about double for extreme inputs. This is all thanks to what Thrustmaster describes as &#8220;controlled overshoot.&#8221; According to the company, all direct-drive wheels will occasionally exceed their advertised maximum force feedback due to factors like inertia, but not intentionally. The responsiveness enabled by the axial-flux design has supposedly enabled Thrustmaster to harness these spikes in power for better performance at the limit.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Using an axial-flux motor unlocks other advantages, including the ability to produce vibrations (like a jolt when shifting gears) without adding extra haptic modules. Like <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/logitech-is-finally-selling-new-sim-racing-wheels-shifters-for-its-direct-drive-base">Logitech&#8217;s</a> TrueForce, developers will need to purposefully integrate that sort of behavior into their titles. Axial-flux technology has taken some time to mature due to heat dissipation challenges, but the company says it&#8217;s tapping into a patented cooling system that is &#8220;passive, quiet, affordable and innovative,&#8221; per a white paper. Despite all the features the T598 packs, it remains relatively compact: The wheel, pedals, and various accessories weigh a total of about 14 pounds.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">On sale now, the Thrustmaster T598 Direct Drive <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/thrustmaster-t-598-direct-drive-wheel-for-playstation-pc-black/6594092.p?skuId=6594092#&#038;intl=nosplash" rel="nofollow">costs</a> $499, excluding tax and shipping.

                <img src="https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/abc7-car-crash.jpg?quality=85"> <p class="article-paragraph skip">Backyard-related worries normally include mowing and painting the deck. For one California woman, the main concern is not getting hit by a car.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Speaking to local news channel <em><a href="https://abc7.com/post/4-cars-crash-san-bernardino-womans-backyard-she-says-road-is-dangerous/15418198/" rel="nofollow">KABC</a></em>, Alysha Wolfinbarger explained that four cars have veered off Kendall Drive in San Bernardino and crashed into her backyard since she moved into her house in 2014. &#8220;It&#8217;s a little scary, honestly. It&#8217;s not something people usually think about—having cars fly into your backyard,&#8221; she told the station. The last crash occurred earlier this year, right as Wolfinbarger was getting out of bed.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">It looks like it&#8217;s quite a drop between the road and the yard. The sedan took part of the fence with it, narrowly missed a shed, and scattered parts everywhere. It had to be lifted out from the road above, and the injuries the driver sustained were serious enough to warrant a trip to the hospital.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">Beyond the annoyance of having to replace a fence or a barbecue every time someone goes straight where the road doesn&#8217;t, Wolfinbarger is understandably worried about safety. She&#8217;s sometimes reluctant to let her five-year-old daughter play in the backyard out of fear that she&#8217;ll get hit by a car. And while she&#8217;s ended up with four cars in her backyard, a fifth crashed near her neighbor&#8217;s property, where young kids often play.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">San Bernardino city officials claim they&#8217;re taking the matter seriously. They&#8217;ve <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/dtxXXZC2y3RJbMPr8" rel="nofollow">put up</a> &#8220;30 mph&#8221; signs and a solar-powered &#8220;your speed&#8221; sign to warn motorists that they&#8217;re going too fast. They&#8217;ve also installed rumble strips, and they&#8217;re looking into adding concrete barriers to protect homes. While that likely won&#8217;t solve the problem of drivers taking the curve too fast and crashing, it will hopefully keep them out of Wolfinbarger&#8217;s yard.</p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip">&#8220;We&#8217;re just tired of seeing cars in our backyard,&#8221; Wolfinbarger summed up. </p>    <p class="article-paragraph skip"><em>Got tips?
