                <p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Sunday European leaders had agreed to draw up a Ukraine peace plan to take to the United States, a vital step for Washington to be able to offer security guarantees Kyiv says are vital to deter Russia.</p><p>At a summit in London just two days after Volodymyr Zelenskiy clashed with U.S. President Donald <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-zelenskiy-sign-minerals-deal-white-house-meeting-2025-02-28/">Trump</a> and cut short a visit to Washington, world leaders offered a strong show of support to the Ukrainian president and promised to do more to help his nation.</p><p>European leaders agreed they must spend more on defence to show Trump the continent can protect itself. And the European Commission chief, with many EU nations struggling with already stretched public finances, suggested the bloc could ease its rules that limit debt levels.</p><p>Starmer, who welcomed a visibly shaken Zelenskiy on Saturday with a warm hug, said Britain, Ukraine, France and some other nations would form a "coalition of the willing" and draw up a peace plan to take to Trump. He did not name other nations, but said more countries were willing to join.</p><p>"We are at a crossroads in history today," Starmer said. "This is not a moment for more talk. It's time to act. Time to step up and lead and to unite around a new plan for a just and enduring peace."</p><p>Zelenskiy said after the summit that European unity was "at an extremely high level not seen for a long time."</p><p>"We are all working together in Europe in order to find a basis for cooperation with America for a true peace and guaranteed security," Zelenskiy wrote on Telegram.</p><p>Europe is scrambling to ensure that Kyiv is not squeezed out of any talks after Trump's shouting match with Zelenskiy in the Oval Office raised fears that the U.S. could pull support for Ukraine and impose a peace plan negotiated with Russia.</p><p>Several leaders said they must increase defence spending - something that could help bring Trump on side to offer a U.S. security guarantee in the event of peace.</p><p>"After a long time of underinvestment, it is now of utmost importance to step up the defence investment for a prolonged period of time," Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, the EU's executive body, told reporters.</p><p>"Member states need more fiscal space to do a surge in defence spending," she said, adding that Europe needed to turn "Ukraine into a steel porcupine that is indigestible for potential invaders".</p><p>Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said leaders agreed Europe needed to take on more responsibility and start bearing the burden of "more spending on its defence budgets within NATO".</p><p>He added the leaders all agreed they must keep close ties with the U.S.</p><p>Europe, which lacks the weaponry and depth of ammunition stocks of the U.S., hopes to convince Trump that it can defend itself but that Russia will only adhere to a peace deal if it comes with the backing of the United States.</p><p>Talks with the U.S. have centred on Washington providing a so-called backstop for a European peacekeeping role, possibly in the form of air cover, intelligence and surveillance and a greater but unspecified threat if Russian President <a href="https://www.reuters.com/topic/person/vladimir-putin/">Vladimir Putin</a> again sought to take more territory.</p><p>Crucial to getting any agreement from Trump is for European nations to increase defence spending and signal they would take part in any peacekeeping role - something Starmer acknowledged was difficult to get unanimity on.</p><p>Starmer increased the UK's <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-defence-spending-reach-25-gdp-by-2027-pm-starmer-says-2025-02-25/">defence spending</a> before his visit to Washington last week, and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said some European leaders had privately set out new plans on defence spending at the meeting but he declined to give details.</p><p>Trump has upended U.S. policy on the three-year-old war since he returned to the White House in January, casting doubt on U.S. military and political support for Ukraine - and Europe - and ending the isolation of Moscow.</p><p>Trump had blindsided Europe by calling Putin without warning and sending a delegation to Saudi Arabia for talks with Russia without including Ukraine or Europe. Trump has falsely suggested that Kyiv was responsible for starting the war, and on Friday, he criticised Zelenskiy for not being grateful for U.S. aid.</p><p>Zelenskiy's clash with Trump on Friday ended a week when Europe had appeared to be in a better position in its drive to encourage Trump to continue to offer support to Ukraine after cordial visits to Washington by French President Emmanuel <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/macron-arrives-white-house-ukraine-talks-with-trump-2025-02-24/">Macron</a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-britains-starmer-meet-white-house-amid-differences-ukraine-2025-02-27/">Starmer</a>.</p><p>Starmer described watching the spat between Zelenskiy and Trump in the Oval Office as uncomfortable viewing, but was keen to push the conversation forward by offering himself as a go-between for Europe and the United States.</p><p>In a further show of support for the Ukrainian leader, Zelenskiy later on Sunday flew to meet King Charles at his private residence in eastern England.</p><p>The Trump administration on Sunday continued to criticise Zelenskiy. White House national security adviser Mike Waltz told CNN that the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/rubio-says-he-has-not-spoken-with-ukraines-zelenskiy-since-friday-white-house-2025-03-02/">U.S. needs a Ukrainian leader</a> who is willing to secure a lasting peace with Russia, but that it is not clear Zelenskiy is prepared to do so.</p><p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov praised <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/donald-trump/">Trump's</a> "common sense" approach and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-praises-trump-scolds-europe-being-crucible-war-2025-03-02/">accused European countries</a> of seeking to prolong the conflict by propping up Zelenskiy "with their bayonets in the form of peacekeeping units".</p><p>Starmer said the leaders on Sunday also agreed to work to ensure Kyiv is at the table of any peace talks and boost the country's own defence capabilities.</p><p>"Europe must do the heavy lifting, but to support peace in our continent and to succeed, this effort must have strong U.S. backing," Starmer told a news conference.</p>  <figure><img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/XXX4FGZ7QFM27N2SB7SIMX6K4U.jpg" alt="People protest outside Downing Street in London"> 	 <figcaption style="text-align: center;"><i>Downing Street, London, March 2, 2025.

                <p>Israel blocked the entry of aid trucks into Gaza on Sunday as a standoff over the truce that has halted fighting for the past six weeks escalated, with Hamas calling on Egyptian and Qatari mediators to intervene.</p><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said earlier that it had adopted a proposal by U.S. President <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/donald-trump/">Donald Trump's</a> envoy, Steve Witkoff, for a temporary ceasefire in Gaza for the Ramadan and Passover periods, hours after the first phase of the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-hamas-diverge-over-ceasefire-with-first-phase-set-expire-2025-02-28/">previously agreed ceasefire</a> expired.</p><p>If agreed, the truce would halt fighting until the end of the Ramadan fasting period around March 31 and the Jewish Passover holiday around April 20.</p><p>The truce would be conditional on Hamas releasing half of the living and dead hostages on the first day, with the remainder released at the conclusion, if an agreement is reached on a permanent ceasefire.</p><p>Hamas says it is committed to the originally agreed ceasefire that had been scheduled to move into a second phase, with negotiations aimed at a permanent end to the war, and it has rejected the idea of a temporary extension to the 42-day truce.</p><p>A senior Hamas official, Mahmoud Mardawi, told Al Jazeera the group would only release the remaining Israeli hostages under the terms of the already agreed-upon phased deal.</p><p>Reflecting the fragility of the ceasefire deal, local health officials said Israeli gunfire had killed four Palestinians in separate attacks in the northern and southern Gaza Strip.</p><p>The Israeli military said that "suspects" were identified close to its troops in northern Gaza and that they had planted a bomb. It added that an airstrike was carried out to "eliminate the threat."</p><p>Egyptian <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-wants-extend-first-phase-gaza-truce-by-six-weeks-egyptian-security-2025-02-28/">sources said on Friday</a> that the Israeli delegation in Cairo had sought to extend the first phase by 42 days, while Hamas wanted to move to the second phase of the ceasefire deal. Spokesman Hazem Qassem said on Saturday that the group rejected Israel's "formulation" of extending the first phase.</p><p>In the first phase of the ceasefire, Hamas handed over 33 Israeli hostages as well as five Thais returned in an unscheduled release, in exchange for around 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees from Israeli jails and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from some of their positions in Gaza.</p><p>Under the original agreement, the second phase was intended to see the start of negotiations over the release of the remaining 59 hostages, the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, and a final end to the war.</p><p>However the talks never began and Israel says all its hostages must be returned for fighting to stop.</p><p>"Israel will not allow a ceasefire without the release of our hostages," Netanyahu's office said, announcing that the entry of all goods and supplies into the Gaza Strip would be halted.</p><p>"If Hamas persists in its refusal, there will be additional consequences."</p><p>Hamas has denounced Israel's move as "blackmail" and a "blatant coup against the agreement".</p><p>"We call on mediators to pressure the occupation to fulfill its obligations under the agreement, in all its phases," it said, adding that the only way to get the hostages back would be to adhere to the agreement and start talks for the second phase.</p><p>Commenting on the goods suspension, senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters the decision would impact the ceasefire talks, adding his group "doesn't respond to pressures."</p><p>Later on Sunday, Israeli officials said a delegation would arrive in Cairo in an apparent move to discuss ways to defuse tensions and ensure the ceasefire remains in effect.</p><p>Speaking at a news conference with his Croatian counterpart, Israel's Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said Palestinians in Gaza would not get goods for free and further negotiations should be linked to the release of the hostages.</p><p>He said the United States "understands" Israel's decision to halt the entry of goods into Gaza, blaming Hamas for the current stalemate in the talks.</p><p>Over the past six weeks, both sides have accused the other of breaching the agreement. But despite repeated hiccups, it has remained in place while the hostage-for-prisoner exchange envisaged in the first phase was completed.</p><p>But there are wide gaps on key areas regarding a permanent end to the war, including what form a postwar administration of Gaza would take and what future there would be for Hamas, which triggered Israel's invasion of Gaza with its attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023.</p><p>The attack killed 1,200 people, in the worst one-day loss of life in Israel's history, and saw 251 people taken into Gaza as hostages. The Israeli campaign has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, displaced almost all of its 2.3 million population and left <a href="https://www.reuters.com/graphics/ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS/FATALITIES/byvrxlqeqve/">Gaza</a> a wasteland.</p><p>Israel insists that Hamas can play no part in the postwar future of Gaza and that its military and governing structures must be eliminated. It also rejects bringing into Gaza the Palestinian Authority, the body set up under the Oslo Accords three decades ago and which exercises limited governance in the occupied West Bank.</p><p>Hamas has said it would not insist on continuing to rule Gaza, which it has controlled since 2007, but it would have to be consulted over whatever future administration followed.</p><p>The issue has been further muddled by Trump's proposal to remove the Palestinian population from Gaza and redevelop the coastal enclave as a property project under U.S. ownership.</p>  <figure><img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/TNYATBZT3ROORJZG4NH4EQT2E4.jpg" alt="A truck carrying aid drives, amid a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, in Rafah"> 	 <figcaption style="text-align: center;"><i>A truck carrying aid drives, amid a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, February 16, 2025.

                <p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his priority in talks with King Charles on Monday will be protecting his country's sovereignty after U.S. President Donald Trump recently suggested making Canada the 51st U.S. state.</p><p>Trudeau said nothing is more important to his citizens than "standing up for our sovereignty and our independence", ahead of the meeting with Charles, who is Canada's head of state.</p><p>Last week, Charles invited Trump to what would be a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/uk-pm-starmer-dismisses-calls-trumps-state-visit-be-cancelled-2025-03-02/">historic</a> second state visit to Britain, with Prime Minister Keir Starmer handing over the invitation during a meeting before the world's media in the Oval Office.</p><p>"I look forward to sitting down with His Majesty tomorrow, as always we will discuss matters of importance to Canada and Canadians, and I can tell you that nothing seems more important to Canadians than standing up for our sovereignty and our independence as a nation," Trudeau told reporters.</p><p>Trudeau, the outgoing prime minister, said last month that Trump's talk about absorbing Canada "is a real thing" and is linked to the country's rich natural resources.</p><p>Trump has repeatedly suggested Canada would be better off if it agreed to become the 51st U.S. state.</p><p>Trudeau was also asked about Trump's meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. "I stand with Zelenskiy," he said.</p>  <figure><img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/GP3OOKA5JJOWTNAATV6QKC3O4U.jpg" alt="European leaders' summit in London"> 	 <figcaption style="text-align: center;"><i>Justin Trudeau, London, March 2, 2025.

                <p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Sunday dismissed calls to cancel the offer of a state visit to U.S. President <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a> after his <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-zelenskiy-sign-minerals-deal-white-house-meeting-2025-02-28/">extraordinary row</a> with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskiy at the White House.</p><p>Starmer at a meeting in Washington last week used a mixture of flattery and the invitation from the royal family for an unprecedented second state visit to try to win a commitment from Trump for a U.S. security guarantee to protect Ukraine if a deal to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraine-russia-war/">end the war with Russia</a> can be reached.</p><p>Some British politicians, including the leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP), have called for the offer to be withdrawn after Trump accused Zelenskiy of not being grateful enough for U.S. support in Ukraine's war.</p><p>Asked if the state visit should be cancelled, Starmer criticised politicians who he said wanted to widen divisions with Washington at a time when Europe faces a "moment of real fragility".</p><p>"I'm not going to be diverted by the SNP or others trying to ramp up the rhetoric without really appreciating what is the single most important thing at stake here, we're talking about peace in Europe," Starmer told the BBC.</p><p>Starmer, unlike some leaders in Europe, has sought to avoid criticising Trump despite provocations on everything from <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/israel-hamas/">Gaza</a> to Ukraine and possible <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/all-donald-trumps-tariff-threats-2025-01-28/">tariffs</a>.</p><p>The invitation from King Charles, handed to Trump by Starmer in the Oval Office before the world's media, would make the U.S. president the first elected political leader in modern times to be hosted for two state visits by a British monarch.</p><p>A state visit is a grand, ceremonial affair full of pomp and pageantry and usually includes a carriage ride and a lavish state banquet.</p><p>During the reign of the late Queen Elizabeth only three U.S. presidents were given full state visits: Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Trump.</p><p>Trump, whose mother was from Scotland, has spoken regularly about his admiration for the British royal family. Although the royals are meant to be apolitical, they are often deployed to try to secure favourable relations with world leaders.</p><p>Trump's first state visit in June 2019 lasted for three days, during which he attended a state banquet and had tea with Charles, who was then heir to the throne.</p><p>The leader of the SNP, John Swinney, said on Sunday "it is hard to believe" that the offer to Trump still stands.</p><p>An opposition Conservative lawmaker Alicia Kearns, previously the head of parliament's foreign affairs committee, also said that the visit should be paused until the U.S. had offered to provide the security guarantee to Ukraine.</p><p>A petition calling for the invite to be cancelled has attracted almost 70,000 signatures and some of the normally right-wing British newspapers have also been critical of Trump since his row with Zelenskiy. The Telegraph said he had been "undeservedly and disgracefully bullied".</p>  <figure><img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/EEPKAFHSGNMQNMX427QBIML7IA.jpg" alt="Britain's PM Starmer hosts a reception on the third anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, in London"> 	 <figcaption style="text-align: center;"><i>Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer speaks to guests during a reception on the third anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in London, Britain, February 24, 2025.

                <p>Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Sunday he believed he could salvage his relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump after their explosive meeting in the Oval Office, but that talks needed to continue behind closed doors.</p><p>In an <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-zelenskiy-sign-minerals-deal-white-house-meeting-2025-02-28/">extraordinary meeting</a> that was broadcast live on Friday, Trump accused Zelenskiy of being ungrateful for U.S. aid, of showing disrespect to his country and of risking World War Three, casting into doubt Washington's ongoing support for Ukraine.</p><p>Zelenskiy, talking to reporters after a summit with European leaders in London on Sunday, said he did not think the U.S. would stop its assistance to Ukraine, because as "leaders of the civilized world" they would not want to help Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p><p>However, Zelenskiy said he remained prepared for any challenges that may arise.</p><p>"As regards to salvaging the relationship, I think our relationship will continue," he told reporters via a translator after the London meeting.</p><p>But he added: "I do not think it's right when such discussions are totally open. ... The format of what happened, I don't think it brought something positive or additional to us as partners."</p><p>Zelenskiy added that he remained ready to sign the proposed <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/even-after-trump-deal-ukraine-faces-long-uncertain-road-mining-boom-2025-02-28/">minerals deal</a> with the United States, and that he believed the U.S. would be ready as well.</p>  <figure><img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/EZODTHRD5NNKTPMNSXF7HZBJ7A.jpg" alt="European leaders hold summit on Ukraine in London"> 	 <figcaption style="text-align: center;"><i>Ukraine‚Äôs President Volodymyr Zelenskiy waves on the day of a summit on Ukraine at Lancaster House in London, Britain, March 2, 2025.

                <p>The acting leader of Abkhazia has won a presidential election in the breakaway Georgian region, state media said on Sunday, months after his predecessor was driven from office following protests over an investment deal with Russia.</p><p>Acting President Badra Gunba took almost 55% of the vote in Saturday's election in the Russia-backed territory, ahead of opposition leader Adgur Ardzinba on just under 42%, Abkhazian state news agency Apsnypress reported, citing preliminary results from the electoral commission.</p><p>Georgia, of which Abkhazia is recognised as being part of by all but a handful of countries, called the election "another flagrant violation of Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity".</p><p>In footage published by state media, Gunba thanked voters and said he would work to make Abkhazia "independent, free and prosperous".</p><p>Abkhazia has in recent months been plagued by an <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/leader-russian-backed-breakaway-region-abkhazia-warns-humanitarian-catastrophe-2024-12-21/">electricity crisis</a>, with blackouts blamed on low water levels at a key hydroelectric plant and large-scale cryptocurrency mining, which requires large amounts of energy.</p><p>Gunba, Abkhazia's vice president since 2020, took over as acting leader in November after his ally Aslan Bzhania <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/leader-breakaway-georgian-region-resigns-russias-interfax-reports-2024-11-18/">resigned</a> days after protesters seized government buildings and forced him to scrap an unpopular deal with Russia.</p><p>It was the third time since 2014 that an Abkhazian leader had been driven from office by mass protests.</p><p>A lush, Black Sea coastal territory of about 240,000 people, Abkhazia broke away from Georgia after a war in the early 1990s, with the support of Russia.</p><p>Russian President <a href="https://www.reuters.com/topic/person/vladimir-putin/">Vladimir Putin</a> congratulated Gunba on the election win on Sunday, Russian media cited the Kremlin as saying.</p><p>Moscow recognised Abkhazia as independent after another war in 2008. Tens of thousands of ethnic Georgians were expelled from the region in successive conflicts.</p><p>Though the territory is politically and economically dependent on Russia, some Abkhazians have been critical of what they see as Moscow's growing influence.</p>  <figure><img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/LE5HCB6DMJJYPOFEOUVEF4Y4GQ.jpg" alt="City views of Sukhumi, the capital of Georgia's breakaway region of Abkhazia"> 	 <figcaption style="text-align: center;"><i>A general view shows the Black Sea port of Sukhumi (Sukhum), the capital of Georgia's breakaway region of Abkhazia September 8, 2024.

                <p>Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty said on Sunday that Egypt's <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/israel-hamas/">Gaza</a> reconstruction plan, which ensures Palestinians remain in their land, is ready and will be presented at an emergency Arab summit in Cairo on Tuesday.</p><p>Arab states, which were swift to reject President Donald Trump's plan for the U.S. to take control of Gaza and resettle Palestinians, are <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/arab-states-scramble-counter-trumps-gaza-riviera-plan-2025-02-21/">scrambling to agree</a> on a diplomatic offensive to counter the idea.</p><p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/why-trumps-proposal-gaza-is-ringing-alarm-bells-region-2025-02-05/">Trump's plan</a>, announced on February 4 amid a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, appeared to back away from longstanding U.S. Middle East policy focused on a two-state solution and sparked anger among Palestinians and Arab nations.</p><p>Abdelatty said Egypt would seek international backing and funding for the plan and emphasised Europe's crucial role, particularly in the financing of Gaza's reconstruction.</p><p>"We will hold intensive talks with major donor countries once the plan is adopted at the upcoming Arab Summit," he said in a press conference with the EU Commissioner for the Mediterranean, Dubravka Suica.</p><p>Israel on Sunday <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-agrees-us-plan-temporary-ceasefire-gaza-pms-office-says-2025-03-01/">blocked the entry of aid</a> trucks into Gaza as a standoff over the truce that has halted fighting for the past six weeks escalated. Abdelatty said the use of aid as a weapon of collective punishment could not be permitted.</p><p>The first phase of the fragile ceasefire agreement expired this weekend. Abdelatty reaffirmed Egypt's commitment to the originally agreed ceasefire that had been scheduled to move into a second phase. "It will be difficult, but with goodwill and political determination, it can be achieved," he said.</p><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said earlier that it had adopted a U.S. proposal for a temporary ceasefire in Gaza for the Ramadan and Passover periods.</p><p>Abdelatty said after Tuesday's summit, foreign ministers of member states of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation would hold an urgent meeting in Saudi Arabia to discuss how to present the plans.</p><p>"We will ensure that the results of the Arab summit are presented to the world in the best possible way," he said.</p>  <figure><img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/HC77MWIO3RKNPHFEN4AASOZDI4.jpg" alt="Egypt's Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty attends a joint press conference with Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa in   Cairo"> 	 <figcaption style="text-align: center;"><i>Egypt's Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty attends a joint press conference with Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa in   Cairo, Egypt March 1, 2025.

                <p>An influential Russian parliamentarian dismissed a summit of European leaders in London on Sunday for producing no plan to settle the war in Ukraine and said Kyiv's only hope for the future was an improvement in ties between Moscow and Washington.</p><p>Konstantin Kosachev, writing on the Telegram messaging app, derided the outcome of the London meeting as "a desperate attempt to pass off as success the failure of a 10-year policy of inciting Ukraine towards Russia by the same Great Britain and, until recently, the United States".</p><p>"Europe has no plan," wrote Kosachev, head of the Foreign Affairs Committee of Russia's upper house of parliament.</p><p>"And if Ukraine should count on something, it can only be on progress (if there is any to come) in Russian-American relations."</p><p>He said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who hosted the meeting, "cannot fail to understand this".</p><p>Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, writing on X before the end of the London gathering, dismissed it as a "coven...to swear allegiance to the Nazi nobodies in Kiev" and a "shameful sight."</p><p>Starmer, speaking after the meeting, said participants had agreed to draw up a Ukraine <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/uks-starmer-tries-revive-hope-ukraine-peace-summit-2025-03-01/">peace plan</a> to take to the United States -- two days after Zelenskiy's meeting in Washington with President Donald Trump broke down in <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-zelenskiy-sign-minerals-deal-white-house-meeting-2025-02-28/">acrimonious exchanges</a>.</p><p>Starmer said Britain, Ukraine, France and some other nations would form a "coalition of the willing" to produce a plan.</p><p>Zelenskiy said he felt strong support from Europe.

                <p>Members of Austria's liberal Neos party on Sunday voted overwhelmingly in favour of a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/key-policies-austrias-new-coalition-government-agreement-2025-02-27/">coalition deal</a> with the conservative People's Party (OVP) and Social Democrats (SPO), paving the way for their three-party <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/austrian-centrist-parties-announce-future-ministers-crucial-vote-looms-2025-02-28/">government</a> to take office.</p><p>The vote was the last remaining obstacle to the planned <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/austrian-centrist-parties-reach-deal-form-government-without-far-right-2025-02-27/">alliance</a>. The government is due to be sworn in on Monday at 11 a.m. (1000 GMT), five months after a parliamentary election the far-right Freedom Party (FPO) won with around 29% of the vote.</p><p>It will end the longest wait for a government in Austria since World War Two. The same centrist parties initially tried to form a coalition government without the FPO but that bid <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/austrian-conservatives-hold-crisis-meeting-after-chancellor-quits-2025-01-05/">collapsed</a> in January. The eurosceptic, Russia-friendly FPO then led an effort that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/austria-goes-back-drawing-board-after-far-right-fails-form-government-2025-02-13/">failed</a> last month.</p><p>The centrist alliance excluding the FPO was one of few remaining alternatives to a snap election that opinion polls suggest would have increased the FPO's lead over other parties.</p><p>"Thank you! Work begins tomorrow!" Neos leader Beate Meinl-Reisinger told the meeting of her party's members in Vienna moments after 94% of them voted in favour of the 200-page coalition agreement, clearing the hurdle of two thirds needed.</p><p>Had they not backed it, the OVP and SPO would have been left with a majority of just one seat in the lower house, which is widely seen as impractically narrow.</p><p>"I have asked myself what democracies are worth if no-one can reach out their hand anymore," Meinl-Reisinger said in a speech before the vote, referring to the months of negotiations and compromises made in different coalition talks.</p><p>The party's priorities include cutting state spending and eliminating red tape, and the government programme includes measures such as pension reform, long a top issue for Neos, a party that has never been in national government.</p><p>"We have a responsibility, each of us (to build) a liberal democracy," she said, ending her speech with the call: "Let's make history today."</p><p>The three centrist parties came second, third and fourth in September's election. As the party with the most votes, the OVP will lead the government, with OVP leader Christian Stocker becoming chancellor. It will also control the interior and defence ministries.</p><p>The SPO will control the finance ministry for the first time in 25 years as well as heading the justice ministry. The Neos will run foreign affairs and education.</p>  <figure><img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/QU3IIBQEW5PIFGZQOPCS3MV5LE.jpg" alt="Neos members to vote Sunday on whether to join coalition during a general meeting in Vienna"> 	 <figcaption style="text-align: center;"><i>Head of NEOS party and its nominee for foreign minister, Beate Meinl-Reisinger speaks at the party's general meeting in Vienna, Austria March 2, 2025.

                <p>For years, soldiers from Russia's Hmeimim Air Base in Syria roamed freely through coastal cities. War planes flew from the complex to bombard Islamist rebels fighting Bashar al-Assad's repressive regime.</p><p>No longer. With Assad gone, at both Hmeimim and at Russia's Soviet-era Tartous Naval Base 60 km (37 miles) south, small groups of former rebels guard the entrances, their Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) Islamist force now in control of the country.</p><p>The khaki-uniformed guards escort any Russian convoys that venture out, they told Reuters reporters visiting the area last week.</p><p>"They have to notify us before they leave," one of the guards said, declining to speak on record.</p><p>The future of the bases, which are integral to Russia's military reach in the Middle East and Africa, is in the hands of Syria's interim President Ahmed Sharaa.</p><p>He wants to renegotiate the generous Assad-era <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/world/russia-establishing-permanent-presence-at-its-syrian-bases-ria-idUSKBN1EK0HA/">49-year lease</a> for Tartous and an indefinite lease for Hmeimim to secure better terms, but doesn't appear to want Moscow shut out altogether.</p><p>Instead, it appears the bases may stay in exchange for diplomatic backing and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/russia-syria-hold-further-talks-russian-military-bases-syria-tass-reports-2025-01-29/">financial compensation</a> from Russia, deeply involved in Syria's economy and defence for seven decades before it joined the civil war in 2015 and wrought devastation that helped keep Assad in power for years.</p><p>Assad fell in December, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/assads-final-hours-syria-deception-despair-flight-2024-12-13/">fleeing to Russia through Hmeimim</a>. The Islamist Syrian leadership - once the target of relentless Russian airstrikes - is now engaged with Moscow at the negotiating table.</p><p>For this story, Reuters spoke to eight Syrian, Russian and diplomatic sources who gave previously unreported details from <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/russia-syria-hold-further-talks-russian-military-bases-syria-tass-reports-2025-01-29/">the first high-level meeting</a> between Sharaa and an envoy sent by President Vladimir Putin, including demands related to billions of dollars of debt, the future of Assad, and the repatriation of Syrian money alleged to be in Russia.</p><p>Like others in the story, the sources requested anonymity to speak about sensitive matters.</p><p>Putting enmity aside has benefits for both parties. Despite the EU and the U.S. easing some sanctions on Syria, the remaining restrictions make it hard to do business with the war-shattered and impoverished country of 23 million.</p><p>A restoration of Russia's traditional supplies of weapons, fuel and wheat could be a life-line. As such, the country's leaders are willing "to make peace, even with their former enemies," one Damascus-based diplomat told Reuters.</p><p>"Moscow still has something to offer for Syria," and is too powerful, too entrenched to ignore, said Anna Borshchevskaya at The Washington Institute.</p><p>"Russia simply needs a government in Damascus that would ensure its interests, and it would be willing to make a deal with that government," she said. One U.N. aid source said that Russia has not exported grain to Syria under the new administration.</p><p>U.S. President Donald Trump has said little about Syria since taking office, but he has sought to repair U.S. relations with Moscow. A U.S. State Department spokesperson said with Assad gone there was an opportunity for Syria "to no longer be dominated and destabilized by Iranian or Russian influence."</p><p>U.S. ally Israel, however, wants Russia to stay as a bulwark against the Turkish influence, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/israel-lobbies-us-keep-russian-bases-weak-syria-sources-say-2025-02-28/">Reuters reported on Friday.</a></p><p>At the January 29 meeting in Damascus, Sharaa sought the cancellation of loans contracted with Russia under Assad, two of the sources told Reuters. Syria, which was largely free of foreign debt before the war, currently has $20 billion-$23 billion in external obligations, Finance Minister Mohammad Abazid said last month, without specifying how much was owed to Russia.</p><p>During the three-hour encounter with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov, Syrian officials raised another key issue, the return of Assad to Syria, but only in broad terms, suggesting it was not a major obstacle to rebuilding ties, one of the sources said. Russia will not agree to extradite Assad, and had not been asked to do so, a senior Russian source said.</p><p>Sharaa also urged the repatriation of Syrian funds his government believes were deposited by Assad in Moscow, but the Russian delegation, led Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov, denied such funds existed, according to a Syria-based diplomat familiar with the talks.</p><p>Sharaa's office and the White House's National Security Council did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>In a statement issued after the meeting, Syria's government said Sharaa stressed that new relations need to address past mistakes and demanded compensation for the destruction Russia caused. The meeting went relatively smoothly, all the sources said. A phone call between Sharaa and Russian President Vladimir Putin two weeks ago was described as <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/russias-putin-holds-phone-call-with-syrias-sharaa-2025-02-12/">constructive</a> by the Kremlin.</p><p>Asked by Reuters on Tuesday whether talks between Moscow and Damascus on the fate of Russia's military bases were progressing, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: ‚ÄúWe are continuing our contacts with the Syrian authorities."</p><p>"So, well, let's just say that the working process is underway," he added.</p><p>Russia‚Äôs Foreign Ministry did not reply to a request for comment.</p><p>Sergei Markov, a former Kremlin adviser, said this month that things were looking good for Moscow.</p><p>‚ÄúThe new Syrian authorities do not see Russia as a hostile country. But Russia will have to do something favourable for the Syrian government in return for these bases,‚Äù he wrote on Telegram.</p><p>In an interview with Saudi Al Arabiya News in late December, Sharaa acknowledged Syria's ‚Äústrategic interests‚Äù with Russia, which supplied the country's now defunct army for generations and financed power plants and dams along with other key infrastructure.</p><p>In turn, with American troops in Syria's northeast, Turkish forces in the north and Israeli troops newly in southern Syria, Russia is resolute in maintaining its only naval base in the Mediterranean.</p><p>Doing so would help Moscow retain political leverage amid a diplomatic scramble for sway over Damascus after Assad's fall.</p><p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov his Turkish counterpart in Ankara on Monday. Their talks included Syria, a Turkish source said. Turkey's Foreign Ministry did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Damascus <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/russia-syria-hold-further-talks-russian-military-bases-syria-tass-reports-2025-01-29/">wants compensation</a> for wartime destruction. Rebuilding costs are projected at $400 billion, according to the U.N. Economic and Social Commission for West Asia (ESCWA).</p><p>Moscow is unlikely to accept responsibility but instead could offer humanitarian aid, said a source familiar with Russia's view on the matter,</p><p>In December, Putin offered the bases as hubs to deliver humanitarian aid to the Syrian people and Russia's ambassador to the U.N. Vasily Nebenzya said Russia's alliance with Syria was ‚Äúnot connected to any regime.‚Äù The U.N. aid source said they were unaware of any aid having been moved through the bases.</p><p>The fate of Assad and associates who fled to Moscow is a delicate matter. Russia remains resistant to surrendering Assad, insisting on continuity in its alliances, the Russian and diplomatic sources said.</p><p>"Russia does not simply give people up because the wind changes direction," the senior Russian source said.</p><p>Syria's war, which erupted nearly 14 years ago with protests against Assad's autocratic rule, left hundreds of thousands of people dead, some 13 million displaced and swathes of the country in ruins.</p><p>Driving from Damascus along the highway to the Russian bases, entire areas stand as grim reminders of Syrian and Russian airstrikes. Buildings are gutted or reduced to rubble.</p><p>Across the street from Hmeimim Air Base, shopowners sat in empty food stalls, lamenting their dire conditions in the dilapidated town.</p><p>In its markets, store signs are in Russian, but the soldiers no longer visit or linger in cafes, locals said.</p><p>"Russian soldiers used to come here to buy beer, whiskey and other drinks, but that's stopped," said the owner of a sandwich shop opposite the base. "Now, they only leave in convoys to their naval base. They don't stop or venture out anymore."</p>  <figure><img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/NTW3ZGDVTVLV3ECWDVCJBEAXEI.jpg" alt="A Russian military vehicle heads towards Hmeimim air base in Syria's coastal Latakia"> 	 <figcaption style="text-align: center;"><i>A Russian military vehicle heads towards Hmeimim air base in Syria's coastal Latakia, Syria, December 15, 2024.

                <p>Top Republicans aligned with U.S. President <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a> pushed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Sunday to change his position on the war with Russia or step aside, ramping up pressure on the Ukrainian leader after a contentious White House meeting last week.</p><p>European leaders gave a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/uks-starmer-tries-revive-hope-ukraine-peace-summit-2025-03-01/">show of support</a> to Zelenskiy at a meeting in London on Sunday, with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer urging his counterparts to step up their defense efforts, just two days after Trump and Vice President JD Vance <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/trumps-zelenskiy-outburst-culmination-weeks-frustration-2025-03-01/">clashed</a> with Zelenskiy in the Oval Office, spurring him to leave early without signing a planned <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/zelenskiy-plans-travel-us-meet-trump-minerals-deal-sources-say-2025-02-25/">minerals deal</a>.</p><p>The blowup, which showcased <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/europe-oval-office-vp-vance-takes-attack-dog-role-trump-2025-03-01/">Vance in an attack dog role</a> for his boss, stunned leaders around the world and raised questions about the next phase of the war, which Russia started by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraine-russia-war/">invading Ukraine</a> three years ago, and Trump's efforts to end it.</p><p>Zelenskiy argued in the meeting that Russian President <a href="https://www.reuters.com/topic/person/vladimir-putin/">Vladimir Putin</a> had not honored a 2019 ceasefire agreement and described him as a killer and a terrorist.</p><p>Trump's national security adviser, Mike Waltz, said it was not clear to the administration that Zelenskiy was ready to negotiate an end of the war. Waltz underscored Trump's goal for a permanent peace between Moscow and Kyiv involving territorial concessions in exchange for European-led security guarantees.</p><p>Asked whether Trump wanted Zelenskiy to resign, Waltz told CNN's "State of the Union" program: "We need a leader that can deal with us, eventually deal with the Russians and end this war."</p><p>"If it becomes apparent that President Zelenskiy's either personal motivations or political motivations are divergent from ending the fighting in his country, then I think we have a real issue on our hands," Waltz added.</p><p>U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a top Trump ally and also an advocate for Ukraine, questioned whether the United States could still work with Zelenskiy following the White House clash in remarks to reporters on Friday.</p><p>House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson issued a similar message on Sunday.</p><p>"Something has to change. Either he needs to come to his senses and come back to the table in gratitude, or someone else needs to lead the country to do that," the top congressional Republican told NBC's "Meet the Press" program, referring to Zelenskiy.</p><p>"I'd like to see Putin defeated, frankly. He is an adversary of the United States. But in this conflict, we've got to bring an end to this war."</p><p>U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont aligned with the Democrats, dismissed suggestions that Zelenskiy should resign.</p><p>"I think that is a horrific suggestion. Zelenskiy is leading a country, trying to defend democracy against an authoritarian dictator, Putin, who invaded his country," Sanders said on "Meet the Press." Republican U.S. Senator James Lankford of Oklahoma said on the same program that he did not agree with calls for Zelenskiy to resign.</p><p>Democrats have expressed disgust over the tenor of Trump's meeting with the Ukrainian leader.</p><p>U.S. Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut lambasted the White House for drawing closer to Russia than to fellow democracies.</p><p>"It is absolutely shameful what is happening right now. The White House has become an arm of the Kremlin," he said on CNN's "State of the Union" program. "The entire pretext for that meeting... was an attempt to rewrite history in order to sign a deal with Putin that hands Putin Ukraine. That is disastrous for U.S. national security."</p><p>Waltz called it "absolutely false" that the Oval Office meeting was an ambush, and the Trump administration put the onus on the Ukrainians to shift their position.</p><p>"We'll be ready to reengage when they're ready to make peace," Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on ABC's "This Week" program. He said he had not spoken to Zelenskiy or Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha since the Friday meeting.</p><p>"No one here is claiming Vladimir Putin is going to get the Nobel Peace Prize this year," Rubio said, while arguing that negotiations with Moscow were required. "You‚Äôre not going to bring them to the table if you‚Äôre calling them names, if you‚Äôre being antagonistic."</p><p>Democrat Amy Klobuchar, a U.S. senator from Minnesota, said on "This Week" that she was "appalled" by the clash in the Oval Office and that she had met with Zelenskiy before he went to the White House on Friday.</p><p>"There is still an opening here" for a peace deal, she said.</p>  <figure><img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/CDPQCUKNSFM7LHP4YLLJYDRJ2I.jpg" alt="White House press secretary Leavitt holds a briefing at the White House in Washington"> 	 <figcaption style="text-align: center;"><i>White House National Security adviser Mike Waltz speaks to members of the media from the briefing room at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., February 20, 2025.
