                                <p>This week one bill completed the process to pass both chambers and will be signed soon by President Trump. The House passed a number of other bills, most with Democratic support and the Senate confirmed the first two cabinet positions for the new administration.</p> <h2>Laken Riley Act</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/s5">S. 5: Laken Riley Act</a> passed the House this week <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2025/h23">263-156</a>. It goes to the President next for signing.</li> </ul> <h2>Other Legislation</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr165">H.R. 165: Wounded Knee Massacre Memorial and Sacred Site Act</a>, which would reduce taxes on the relevant land, passed <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2025/h22">416-0</a>.</li> <li><a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr187">H.R. 187: MAPWaters Act of 2025</a>, which would "provide for the standardization, consolidation, and publication of data relating to public outdoor recreational use of Federal waterways among Federal land and water management agencies", passed <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2025/h19">413-0</a>.</li> <li><a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr375">H.R. 375: Continued Rapid Ohia Death Response Act of 2025</a>, which would continue to provide support for efforts to address a disease affecting native trees in Hawaii, passed <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2025/h24">359-62</a>.</li> <li>H.R. 471: Fix Our Forests Act](<a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr47">https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr47</a>), which would primarily allow logging companies to bypass environmental reviews, passed <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2025/h25">279-141</a>. There are a number of provisions in the bill and differing attitudes towards its central provisions. <a href="https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/2024/10/11/oregons-congressional-members-sharply-divided-over-bill-to-step-up-logging-to-prevent-wildfires/">The Oregon Capital Chronicle</a> provides a good overview of the bill's contents.</li> </ul> <h2>Republican Priority Legislation</h2> <p>In the <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hres5/text/eh#link=5_a_%7ET1&amp;nearest=HCF4279D4F89845B7947163E919CDA0DC">House Rules resolution</a> for the 119th Congress, Republicans listed twelve pieces of legislation they considered the highest priority for passage. So far, they've passed six of them; all with Democratic support, although not necessarily much Democratic support. The Laken Riley Act noted above covers two of the priority bills after an amendment added by the Senate. This week, they added one more (the sixth of twelve) with the</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr21">H.R. 21: Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act</a> which would require health care providers to provide care for any fetus that survived an attempted abortion, passed <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2025/h27">217-204</a>. One Democrat, <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/henry_cuellar/400657">Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-TX28)</a> voted in support of the bill. This bill has come up repeatedly in the last decade. <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2019/03/the-facts-on-the-born-alive-debate/">This article from Fact Check</a> notes that reports of this situation are extraordinarily rare. Some states go years without a single instance reported despite tens of thousands of abortions.</li> </ul> <h2>Trump Cabinet Confirmations</h2> <p>So far, two Cabinet nominees have been confirmed: <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2025/s8">Marco Rubio for Secretary of State</a> and <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2025/s13">John Ratcliffe for Director of the Central Intelligence Agency</a>.</p>

                <!-- Intentionally not escaping for html context -->
                                <p>Hi everyone. Today you're hearing from Josh, the founder of GovTrack. I'm writing for two reasons. First, we have some new features on the site that you may find useful. Second, I have a more dire note about the last decade's trajectory in government accountability.</p> <h2>New on GovTrack</h2> <p>Our newest feature is <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/missing">Missing Legislators</a>. Last year former Rep. Kay Granger managed to <a href="https://www.notus.org/congress/kay-granger-republican-majority">disappear from Congress</a> for five months. That should never happen again, and that's why we built Missing Legislators to see at a glance if any legislators have missed a large number of recent votes. We <a href="https://mastodon.social/@GovTrack">post to social media</a> every time a legislator is added to the list. Check on it to be sure your representatives don't make the list.</p> <p>On the vote search page, you can now <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes#session=308&amp;sort=uniformity">sort votes from least to most party uniformity</a>. Some votes also have a new table showing how the vote <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/118-2024/h136">breaks down by congressional caucuses</a>, which gives insight into the factions and blocs in Congress. And you can <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/posts.rss">subscribe to an RSS feed of these very updates</a> if that's your thing.</p> <p>We've been <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/press">in the news</a> lately: We <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/12/31/congress-passes-only-503-bills-one-of-the-least-productive-in-decades.html">appeared on CNBC</a> to talk about what Congress accomplished and the outlook for 2025. NBC News used our data to write about <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/congress-age-2025-third-oldest-us-history-rcna185742">Congress getting older</a>. <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/2024/12/23/texas-rep-kay-granger-missed-majority-of-us-house-votes-this-year/">The Dallas Morning News</a> mentioned us in their article about Rep. Granger. And new <a href="https://www.psypost.org/congress-members-less-outspoken-against-covid-19-policies-after-personal-infections-study-finds/">research used our database</a> of legislators who got COVID.</p> <h2>A dire outlook</h2> <p>There is some more good news before I get to the bad news: Congress is getting more transparent about its day-to-day activities.</p> <p>In the last decade, <a href="http://congress.gov">Congress.gov</a> has become a modern and sophisticated legislative research tool, the House now usually gives a week of advanced notice on bills being considered and committee schedules, committee meetings are now all streamed online, historical records are being digitized, and on. The best part is that nonpartisan staff regularly meet with us and other congressional transparency organizations to include us in charting the path forward. There is a beacon of light there. (It's no accident the beacon exists. It's something we advocated for.)</p> <p>The rest isn't good.</p> <p>In Congress, bills are getting cobbled together in last-minute huge omnibus deals that are nearly impossible to read (a problem that's been getting worse over the last decade). The <a href="https://firstbranchforecast.substack.com/p/the-new-years-eve-ethics-massacre">ethics committees are often rubber-stamps</a>. The Senate still gives few clues about upcoming votes. Committee votes are still hard to find. Legislators are ceding more power to the executive branch and Big Tech. And, frankly, many legislators are simply not being serious.</p> <p>Outside of Congress, in the executive branch, well, it's been <a href="https://governing.digital/2022/12/09/response-to-the-proposed-themes-for-a-5th-u-s-national-action-plan-on-open-government/">a long time since a president made any effort</a> to create a more transparent government or shut the revolving door of corporate lobbyists. The Biden Administration waited for its last days to issue <a href="https://civic-texts.ghost.io/good-news-for-the-open-social-web-and-open-government-data/">an executive order implementing an open data law</a> enacted six years ago --- it was too little too late. The Supreme Court won't address its appearance of wild impropriety. (I wish somebody would send me on secret trips to elite resorts too! I promise it won't affect my judgment.) The media, both "mainstream" and "social," has given up on standing up to power as they drown us in an expanding stream of homogenizing bullshit (forgive my language). Generative AI is making it worse. And we know what to expect for the Trump Administration's position on transparency and accountability since we've been here before.</p> <p>There are <a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/open-government-nonprofits-are-dying-off-just-when-needed-most">few organizations like ours left</a>. It's dire. It's really dire.</p> <p>I don't have a positive note to end on, and I don't know what to do. The trajectory of the last decade for transparency, accountability, and democracy will be hard to turn around.</p> <p>But we're not going anywhere. Stand with us. Stay the course.</p>

                                <h2>Transparency and Disaster Assistance</h2> <p>Most votes this week were overwhelmingly approved.</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr153">H.R. 153: Post-Disaster Assistance Online Accountability Act</a> which would "provide for an online repository for certain reporting requirements for recipients of Federal disaster assistance" passed <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2025/h10">426-0</a>.</li> <li><a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr144">H.R. 144: Tennessee Valley Authority Salary Transparency Act</a>, which would require the publication of salaries of executives of the Tennessee Valley Authority, passed <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2025/h14">423-0</a>.</li> <li><a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr192">H.R. 192: Amtrak Executive Bonus Disclosure Act</a> passed <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2025/h8">407-0</a>.</li> <li><a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr33">H.R. 33: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide special rules for the taxation of certain residents of Taiwan with income from sources within the United States</a>, which is intended to provide tax relief for some residents of Taiwan, passed <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2025/h15">423-1</a>.</li> <li><a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr164">H.R. 164: POWER Act of 2025</a>, which would permit federal agencies to provide additional assistance after a disaster, passed <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2025/h13">419-2</a>.</li> <li><a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr152">H.R. 152: Federal Disaster Assistance Coordination Act</a>, which would fund a study to improve information collection and damage assessments after a disaster, passed <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2025/h9">405-5</a></li> </ul> <h2>Banning Transgender Athletes</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr28">H.R. 28: Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act of 2025</a>, which would bar federal funding from any school K-post-secondary that allows trans girls/women athletes, passed <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2025/h12">218-206</a>.</li> </ul> <h2>Immigration</h2> <ul> <li> <p><a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr30">H.R. 30: Preventing Violence Against Women by Illegal Aliens Act</a>, which would "amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to provide that aliens who have been convicted of or who have committed sex offenses or domestic violence are inadmissible and deportable", passed <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2025/h17">274-145</a>. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/16/us/house-bill-deport-immigrants.html">New York Times reports</a>, "existing law already allows immigrants with contested legal status who are convicted of sex crimes to be deported".</p> </li> <li> <p><a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/s5">S. 5: Laken Riley Act</a> continues to work through the Senate. Last week, Democratic Senators said they were voting to move forward on the bill in order to improve it by amendment. So far this week, <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2025/s3">Democrats voted for an amendment to expand its scope</a>, but <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2025/s4">Republicans did not vote for an amendment to remove its most far-reaching provision</a> which would give states substantial new authority over immigration policy. Today, Democrats can, if they're unhappy enough with how the amendment process went, prevent the bill from coming to the floor by refusing to vote to end debate.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Missing Members</h2> <p>After the news at the end of December that former Rep. Kay Granger had missed several months of votes, due it appears to <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2024/12/22/texas-kay-granger-health-fort-worth/">significant and never disclosed health problems</a>, we set up an alert for ourselves and our users to try and prevent such lengthy absences from slipping past again.</p> <p>This week we were alerted that several CA legislators had missed votes last week, presumably because  of the wildfires around Los Angeles.</p> <p>Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA11) also missed some votes, presumably because she's still recovering from fracturing her hip in late December.</p> <p>When we can, we'll try to find out why someone might be out and note it in our recaps and on the <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/missing">Missing Legislators</a> page.</p> <h2>Nomination Hearings</h2> <p>There were about a dozen committee hearings for cabinet nominees for President-elect Trump's next term this week. We watched some where we could, but if there's an agency or nominee of particular interest to you that you missed, you can still watch the recordings. Go to <a href="https://www.congress.gov/committee-schedule/weekly/2025/01/13">Congress.gov's Committee Meetings</a> calendar and look for the one you want.</p> <p>Votes on the nominees will start sometime next week. Only a simple majority is needed and there are enough Republicans to get a simple majority even for nominees who do not have Democratic support. Of the nominees with hearings so far, all appear likely to be confirmed, possibly with some Democratic votes.</p>

                                <p>Today we have the last two of our series on former Congressmembers nominated for President-elect Trump's cabinet. We've combined them because we want to get them to you in time and still keep up our legislative recap posts while not inundating everyone's inbox. Noem's hearing will be on <a href="https://www.congress.gov/event/119th-congress/senate-event/336506?s=1&amp;r=28">Friday, Jan. 17</a> and Duffy's is <a href="https://www.congress.gov/event/119th-congress/senate-event/336508?s=1&amp;r=10">today, Jan. 15 at 10 am EST</a>.</p> <p>If you don't see this until after the hearings, the recordings are generally available to watch later at the same link as with <a href="https://www.congress.gov/event/119th-congress/senate-event/336480?s=1&amp;r=1">Pete Hegseth's hearing yesterday</a></p> <hr> <h3>How did Trump‚Äôs Homeland Security Secretary nominee Kristi Noem vote in Congress?</h3> <p><a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/kristi_noem/412475">Former Rep. Kristi Noem (R-SD0)</a>, now governor of South Dakota, is President-elect Donald Trump‚Äôs pick to replace <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/keywords/secretary-alejandro-mayorkas">Alejandro Mayorkas</a> as Secretary of Homeland Security. The position requires confirmation by the Senate.</p> <p>Her home state lies 1,500 miles from the Mexico border. But she‚Äôs made a name for herself in part through border policies, including <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/29/noem-national-guard-border/">deploying her state‚Äôs National Guard to the border</a> with Mexico three times, frequent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=826GeNuTLD4&amp;pp=ygUUS3Jpc3RpIE5vZW0gRm94IE5ld3M%3D">Fox News appearances</a> to discuss the issue, and famously declaring to her legislature: <a href="https://news.sd.gov/news?id=news_kb_article_view&amp;sysparm_article=KB0041679">‚ÄúEvery state is now a border state.‚Äù</a></p> <p>The Department of Homeland Security contains the border and immigration agencies ICE, CBP, USCIS, TSA, and the <a href="https://www.gocoastguard.com/about#:%7E:text=The%20U.S.%20Coast%20Guard%20is,the%20Department%20of%20Homeland%20Security.">Coast Guard</a>, as well as the Secret Service, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and FEMA which handles emergency and disaster relief.</p> <p>(<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/12/04/noem-fema-south-dakota-floods/">Some South Dakota residents say</a> that Noem as governor has done a poor job managing June‚Äôs floods in the state.)</p> <p>Noem served in Congress from 2011 to 2018.</p> <h4>Border wall funding</h4> <p>In Congress, Noem <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/115-2017/h435">voted for</a>  <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-gop-approves-1-6-billion-trump-s-wall-n787271">$1.6 billion</a> towards Trump‚Äôs border wall in July 2017, as did almost all House Republicans. Only five GOP members voted against it, while an identical five Democrats voted for it.</p> <p>But when that money was ultimately incorporated into a <a href="https://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20180319/BILLS-115SAHR1625-RCP115-66.pdf">2,232-page</a> government funding bill in March 2018, Noem voted against it. That bill divided House Republicans, who supported it by <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/115-2018/h127">145-90</a>.</p> <p>GOP supporters hailed the border wall funding and other conservative measures ‚Äì after all, Republicans controlled both congressional chambers at the time. But most Republican opponents <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2018/03/22/us-house-passes-13-trillion-spending-bill-includes-some-border-wall-fu/">aligned on the party‚Äôs right wing</a>, criticizing the bill for Democratic-added provisions attaching conditions to the border wall funding, including provisions funding medical services (other than abortion) provided by Planned Parenthood.</p> <h4>Bills introduced</h4> <p>For eight years before Noem rose to national prominence as governor starting in 2019, she represented South Dakota‚Äôs lone seat in the House with comparative anonymity ‚Äì and with far less policy focus on homeland security, immigration, or border issues.</p> <p>She was the primary sponsor of <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/browse?sponsor=412475">85 bills</a>, almost none of which focused on homeland security, immigration, or border issues.</p> <p>In fact, most of her legislation was very niche and state-specific in nature. These include bills with titles like the <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr686">Protect Our Prairies Act</a>, the <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr2801">Protecting Access to Rural Therapy Services Act</a>, and the <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/hr5871">Spearfish Canyon and Bismarck Lake Land Exchange Act</a>.</p> <p>An archived version of her House.gov website from 2013 had a webpage titled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130214033504/http://noem.house.gov/index.cfm/kristi-on-the-issues">‚ÄúKristi on the Issues,‚Äù</a> which listed 11 policy issues, none of which are in the current purview of the Department of Homeland Security.</p> <h4>Native Americans</h4> <p>As governor, Noem‚Äôs relationships with South Dakota‚Äôs nine federally-recognized Native American tribes deteriorated to such a level that by May, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/22/politics/kristi-noem-tribal-lands-ban/index.html">all nine had banned her from their lands</a>. But back in Congress, she introduced quite a bit of legislation promoting Native Americans or tribal issues. This included:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/hr6028">RESPECT Act</a> to repeal a number of antiquated or racist federal laws and provisions, mostly dating from the 1800s and early 1900s. The acronym RESPECT stood for Repealing Existing Substandard Provisions Encouraging Conciliation with Tribes.</p> </li> <li> <p>A bill to <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr1894">create an Office of Tribal Relations</a> within the Department of Agriculture.</p> </li> <li> <p><a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr1836">Protect Our Native Women Act</a>, which aimed to crack down on domestic violence and sexual assault on tribal lands.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>PRINT Act</h4> <p>In 2018, GovTrack <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/hr6031/summary#oursummary">covered</a> Noem‚Äôs PRINT Act, a bill she introduced specifically to <em>reverse</em> a Trump measure.</p> <p>Trump‚Äôs Commerce Department instituted a 22% tariff on Canadian groundwood paper, often used to produce physical newspapers. While the ostensible reason was that Canada subsidized its paper industry at a level the U.S. didn‚Äôt, many believed Trump also had another unspoken motive: to punish the journalism and newspaper businesses.</p> <p>Noem published an opinion column about her bill which <a href="https://highlandcountypress.com/index.php/news/supporting-hometown-newspaper#gsc.tab=0">strongly defended journalism</a>, in a way that‚Äôs much harder to imagine only six years later in 2024, given Republicans‚Äô pronounced turn towards attacking media as biased and ‚Äúfake news‚Äù even just since then.</p> <p>The bill‚Äôs acronym PRINT stood for Protecting Rational Incentives in Newsprint Trade Act.</p> <p>Ultimately, the legislation became moot, as the U.S. International Trade Commission <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/29/business/trump-tariffs-newsprint.html">reversed the Trump tariff</a> later that year.</p> <h4>What Congress is saying</h4> <p>‚ÄúFortunately, President Trump has chosen Gov. Kristi Noem, a trusted leader and proven executive, to undertake the essential responsibility of restoring the Department‚Äôs core mission and securing the American homeland,‚Äù <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/mike_johnson/412706">Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA4)</a>  <a href="https://mikejohnson.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1479">said in a press release</a>.¬†</p> <p>Back home, Democrats in South Dakota have expressed more concerns about her border stances.</p> <p>"Gov.¬† Noem made a statement today that all of the people coming across the southern border are criminals. We don't agree," South Dakota state House top Democrat Oren Lesmeister <a href="https://www.dakotanewsnow.com/2024/02/01/sd-democrats-respond-gov-noems-border-speech/">said earlier this year</a>. "There are a lot of these people seeking asylum in the United States, trying to get away from poverty and other issues that they have to live and deal with everyday. There's some good people that are coming across our border."</p> <p>In 2017, most Senate Democrats voted against Trump‚Äôs last Secretary of Homeland Security nominee Kirstjen Nielsen by <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/115-2017/s305">11-37</a>, though she was still confirmed in the Republican-led chamber. A similar result seems likely this time.</p> <p><a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/gary_peters/412305">Sen. Gary Peters (D-MI)</a>, the top Democrat on the Senate Homeland Security Committee, <a href="https://x.com/priscialva/status/1866908067666776563">told CNN</a> that he was "withholding judgment" on Noem‚Äôs pick.</p> <hr> <h3>How did Trump‚Äôs Transportation Secretary nominee Sean Duffy vote in Congress?</h3> <p><a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/sean_duffy/412488">Former Rep. Sean Duffy (R-WI7)</a> is President-elect Donald Trump‚Äôs pick to replace <a href="https://www.transportation.gov/meet-secretary/secretary-pete-buttigieg">Pete Buttigieg</a> as Transportation Secretary. The position requires confirmation by the Senate.</p> <p>Duffy served in the House from 2011 to 2019, when he resigned to <a href="https://www.today.com/news/congressman-sean-duffy-resigning-due-health-complications-9th-child-t161345">take care of his ninth child, an infant with a heart defect</a>.</p> <p>During his nine years in Congress, he was lead sponsor of <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/browse?sponsor=412488">108 bills</a>, almost none primarily related to transportation. By GovTrack‚Äôs count, by far his most common primary issue area was ‚Äúfinance and financial sector‚Äù at 42%. <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/browse?sponsor=412488&amp;subject=5852#terms=6359">Only two of his bills were <em>primarily</em> about transportation</a>, though others may have touched on it more tangentially.</p> <p>Those two bills were:</p> <h4><a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/hr3778">TIMBER Act</a></h4> <p>The 2015 bill would have eliminated weight limits for vehicles related to logging or other ‚Äúforest products,‚Äù though not nationally ‚Äì only for a specific <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/hr3778/text/ih#link=2_%7EQ1_m_2_D_%7ET1&amp;nearest=H466C5553BE8D4E8E83391ACD1B8302BC">13-mile stretch of Wisconsin‚Äôs Interstate Route 39</a>.</p> <p>The issue was personal to Duffy, who previously <a href="https://rollcall.com/2011/11/04/sean-duffy-no-stranger-to-logrolling/">worked as a lumberjack</a> and whose hometown Hayward is home to the <a href="https://lumberjackworldchampionships.com/">Lumberjack World Championships</a>.</p> <p>The legislation was ultimately <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/hr22/text/enr#link=A_I_D_1410_%7EQ1_o&amp;nearest=H6F188E940C694994AE89F8939DAC2BC8">incorporated</a> into the <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/hr22">FAST (Fixing America‚Äôs Surface Transportation) Act</a>. While that larger <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/hr22/text">490-page</a> law attracted overwhelming support by both parties in both the <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/114-2015/h673">House</a> and <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/114-2015/s331">Senate</a>, Duffy actually <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/114-2015/h673">voted against it</a>, his own provision notwithstanding.</p> <h4><a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/hr354">Railroad fines for blocking traffic during a shift change</a></h4> <p>Another 2015 bill would have fined railroad carriers $10,000 for each hour in which they blocked traffic at a crossing due to a shift change.</p> <p>The bill attracted <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/hr354/cosponsors">two Republican cosponsors</a> but never received a committee vote.</p> <h4>Thoughts on Democrats‚Äô 2021 infrastructure law</h4> <p>In 2021, Congress enacted the <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/117/hr3684">Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act</a>, a <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/117/hr3684/text">1,039-page</a> law comprising <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-congress-infrastructure-bill-signing-b5b8cca843133de060778f049861b144">$1 trillion</a> in infrastructure and transportation spending. The package passed on a mostly party-line vote, with almost unanimous Democratic support in both chambers, while Republicans largely rejected it by <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/117-2021/s314">19-30</a> in the Senate and <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/117-2021/h369">13-200</a> in the House.</p> <p>While Duffy was out of Congress by then, he publicly opposed the package, calling the high price tag ‚Äúsocialist‚Äù <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2021/10/29/sean-duffy-build-back-better-biden/">in a 2021 appearance on Fox News‚Äôs <em>Outnumbered</em></a>. Passing the package and the larger Biden agenda would be ‚Äúcatastrophic for America,‚Äù he claimed. (He didn‚Äôt elaborate on the claim.).</p> <h4>Environment</h4> <p>Transportation generates <a href="https://www.epa.gov/transportation-air-pollution-and-climate-change/carbon-pollution-transportation">28%</a> of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, also known as GHGs, marking the largest such contributor of GHGs to climate change. Biden‚Äôs Transportation Department has issued a series of rules and regulations <a href="https://www.transportation.gov/priorities/climate-and-sustainability/climate-action">aimed at curbing transportation emissions and pollution</a>.¬†</p> <p>Duffy‚Äôs congressional voting record on environmental issues rated a <a href="https://scorecard.lcv.org/moc/sean-duffy">lifetime 2% score</a> from the League of Conservation Voters.</p> <p>Why 2%? Of the 298 votes the organization marked as important environmental votes during his tenure, he actually cast what they deemed a ‚Äúpro-environment‚Äù vote in five:</p> <ol> <li> <p>A 2011 vote to <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/112-2011/h590">increase funding for Gulf Coast restoration projects in Louisiana by $1 million</a>. Unusually for an environmental vote, the provision attracted a <em>higher</em> percentage of Republican support than Democratic: 67% of House Republicans voted for it, compared to 57% of House Democrats. The measure passed, though it ultimately <a href="https://scorecard.lcv.org/roll-call-vote/2011-590-gulf-coast-restoration">wasn‚Äôt included in the final larger package</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>A 2011 vote <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/112-2011/h633">against cutting more than $3 billion from a pending Interior and Environment appropriations bill</a>. House Democrats unanimously opposed it by 0-179, while House Republicans were more torn, slightly voting for it by 126-105, pitting Duffy against most members of his party. The measure failed.</p> </li> <li> <p>A 2012 vote <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/112-2012/h262">supporting several reforms to the National Flood Insurance Program</a>, some of which would take environmental concerns more into account when setting rates. The vote was overwhelmingly in favor from both parties: 181-1 from House Democrats and 221-17 from House Republicans.</p> </li> <li> <p>A 2016 vote <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/114-2016/h570">giving $170 million to Flint, Michigan to fix its water infrastructure</a>. A 2014 switch to alternative water sources <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5353852/">promoted by state officials and the governor</a> seeped toxic lead into the city‚Äôs water supply. House Democrats unanimously supported the congressional bill by 183-0, while House Republicans voted majority against it by 101-141, pitting Duffy against most members of his party. The measure passed.</p> </li> <li> <p>A 2019 vote <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/116-2019/h372">against a provision that would have impeded governmental efforts to save the endangered North Atlantic right whale</a>. The provision was overwhelmingly rejected by both parties: 13-220 by House Democrats and 71-125 by House Republicans. The measure failed.</p> </li> </ol> <h4>What Congress is saying</h4> <p>‚ÄúSean is an excellent choice to lead DOT,‚Äù Senate Commerce and Transportation Committee top Republican <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/ted_cruz/412573">Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX)</a>  <a href="https://x.com/SenTedCruz/status/1866564667922858350">posted on X</a>, formerly Twitter.</p> <p>‚ÄúHis commitment to modernizing roads, bridges, and railways while advocating for equitable transportation funding resonates with Americans who often feel left behind by federal priorities skewed toward urban centers,‚Äù <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/marcus_molinaro/456925">Rep. Marcus Molinaro (R-NY19)</a>  <a href="https://washingtonreporter.news/p/op-ed-rep-marc-molinaro-why-sean">wrote in a <em>Washington Reporter</em> opinion column</a>. Duffy ‚Äúsignals a renewed focus on bridging the transportation and infrastructure gaps that have long hindered economic growth in communities across the country.‚Äù</p> <p>Democrats were more cautious. While they seem likely to oppose most of his environmental stances, they haven‚Äôt explicitly condemned Duffy to the levels they have for Trump‚Äôs more controversial Cabinet nominees.</p> <p>Indeed, "No specific criticism of Duffy‚Äôs nomination has emerged yet from Senate Democrats,‚Äù <a href="https://enotrans.org/article/duffy-likely-to-be-confirmed-as-transportation-secretary/">the Eno Center for Transportation noted</a>. ‚ÄúUnless something odd and unusual turns up on a background check, there probably won‚Äôt be much opposition."</p> <p>‚ÄúTransportation policy has a long bipartisan history, and I look forward to continuing to maintain the tradition under former Rep. Sean Duffy‚Äôs leadership and working together to pass the next surface transportation authorization, creating more jobs, if he is confirmed as Secretary,‚Äù House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee top Democrat <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/rick_larsen/400232">Rep. Rick Larsen (D-WA2)</a>  <a href="https://democrats-transportation.house.gov/news/press-releases/ranking-member-larsen-statement-on-former-representative-sean-duffys-nomination-for-department-of-transportation-secretary">said in a press release</a>.</p>

                                <p>This week is light on legislation but heavy on hearings in the United States Senate. There are thirteen hearings for Trump‚Äôs proposed cabinet nominees out of the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/committee-schedule/weekly/2025/01/13">hearings scheduled for this week</a>. One of those hearings, into the Attorney General nominee, is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s-ODI8He_s">two-parter</a>.</p> <p><strong>On Tuesday</strong>, there are hearings for the nominations of former-Rep. Doug Collins to be Secretary of Veterans Affairs (<a href="https://www.govtrack.us/posts/465/2024-12-30_trump-veterans-affairs-nominee-doug-collins">which we wrote more about here</a>), Peter Hegseth to be Secretary of Defense, and Doug Burgum to be Secretary of the Interior.</p> <p><strong>On Wednesday</strong>, there are hearings for the nominations of former Rep. Kristi Noem to be Secretary of Homeland Security (we‚Äôll have an article about that later this week), Pamela Jo Bondi to be Attorney General, Sen. Marco Rubio to be Secretary of State (he‚Äôll have to resign from the Senate if he‚Äôs confirmed), John Ratcliffe to be Director of the CIA, former Rep. Sean Duffy to be Secretary of Transportation (more from us forthcoming), Chris Wright to be Secretary of Energy, and Russell Vought to be Director of the White House‚Äôs Office of Management and Budget which assists the President in directing federal agencies.</p> <p><strong>On Thursday</strong>, there are hearings for the nominations of Eric Scott Turner to be Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, former Rep. Lee Zeldin to be EPA Administrator (<a href="https://www.govtrack.us/posts/464/2024-12-28_trump-epa-administrator-nominee-lee-zeldin">which we wrote more about here</a>), part two of Pamela Jo Bondi to be the Attorney General, and Scott Bessent to be Secretary of the Treasury.</p> <p>On the House side, I see a ton of committee organizational meetings where the committees adopt their rules for the upcoming Congress.</p> <p>There are a few non-nomination policy hearings in both chambers, but I expect they will be overshadowed by the pile-up in the Senate.</p> <p>Nine bills are lined up <a href="https://www.majorityleader.gov/schedule/weekly-schedule.htm">on the House floor</a> ‚Äî six bills scheduled on ‚Äúsuspension‚Äù (the fast-track path which takes a 2/3rds vote) and three bills set for consideration pursuant to a rule which means they need only a simple majority but may have limited debate. The three bills are designed to keep Republicans together, split Democrats, and appeal to the party base. They are</p> <ul> <li> <p><a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr28">H.R. 28</a>, aimed at preventing trans girls and women from competing in athletics¬†at any school from k-12 and beyond which accepts federal funding</p> </li> <li> <p><a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr30">H.R. 30</a>, aimed at deporting any undocumented person who has committed a sex offense or domestic violence, and¬†</p> </li> <li> <p><a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr33">H.R. 33</a>, which concerns lessening the tax burden for investments in Taiwan, but the real target is China. A 2013 <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CRPT-118hrpt309/pdf/CRPT-118hrpt309.pdf">committee report</a> on an earlier version of this bill described the purpose as to¬† ‚Äústrengthen the U.S.-Taiwan economic alliance and improve the United States‚Äô competitive position versus China‚Äù through ‚Äúrelief from double taxation on U.S.-Taiwan cross-border investment.‚Äù</p> </li> </ul> <p>Senate Republicans appear to not have updated their <a href="https://www.republicanleader.senate.gov/">website</a> as it indicates Sen. McConnell is still the Republican leader, so it is difficult to know their floor schedule. Nonetheless, Republicans are continuing to move their version of the <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/s5">Laken Riley Act</a> to a vote, with the open question of whether and what amendments they will allow. That legislation would allow the federal government to take into custody unlawfully present non-citizens who have been charged with theft, which raises policy questions like whether a <a href="https://immigrationforum.org/article/dreamers-in-the-united-states-an-overview-of-the-dreamer-community-and-proposed-legislation/">Dreamer</a> should be deported for having been charged with but not convicted of petty crimes like shoplifting.</p> <p>Happening in the background is the organizing of both chambers, with members being named to committees.</p>

                                <p>This was the end of the first full week of the 119th Congress. Much had been made before the start of this Congress of the House's very slim Republican majority which was presumed to (and may still in some cases) make it hard to pass legislation. Many journalists also noted that the new Republican Majority Leader, John Thune, said he was committing to the Senate working on Fridays which they have not been doing for quite a while.</p> <p>This week, neither issue was in play. The Senate left yesterday as usual and the two bills in the House up for a vote got plenty of Democratic support which made the slim Republican majority irrelevant.</p> <p>Only three bills got recorded votes in both chambers together and two were ostensibly the same bill even though there were separate Senate and House versions. Both were voted on last Congress in the House and both were on the list of 12 Republican bills given priority in the <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hres5">House Rules</a> which were adopted last week. Possibly ironically, the Rules passed by a much closer margin, <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2025/h5">215-209</a>, than either of the bills below when presented individually.</p> <h2>Illegitimate Court Counteraction Act</h2> <p><a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr23">This bill</a> would "impose sanctions with respect to the International Criminal Court engaged in any effort to investigate, arrest, detain, or prosecute any protected person of the United States and its allies". In this case, it's aimed at the ICC's efforts to pursue members of the Israeli government over the war with Gaza. It passed <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2025/h7">243-140</a>.</p> <h2>Laken Riley Act</h2> <p><a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr29">H.R. 29: Laken Riley Act</a> passed the House <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2025/h6">264-159</a>. This bill would allow for the detention of non-citizens who are charged with certain crimes. <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/house-republicans-pass-laken-riley-act-immigration-rcna186488">Opponents of the bill note</a></p> <blockquote> <p>The truth is that migrants arrested for crimes are already subject to detention, and there is little evidence that this law would have protected Riley, as ICE had made a previous effort to detain Ibarra.</p> </blockquote> <p>The bill further authorizes state attorneys general to sue the federal government if they feel that the federal government is failing to adequately enforce existing immigration laws. The consequences of the passage of this law are not yet clear, but it appears that it would change the existing model in which the federal government controls immigration policy, due to its overlap with foreign relations, to one in which states would start to exert some control over immigration policy and presumably, by extension, foreign relations.</p> <p>This bill passed the House last Congress as well, but was never brought up for a vote in the Senate. Now that the Senate has a Republican majority, it is already moving through Senate procedural steps with significant Democratic support. The first vote, a motion to proceed to debate, passed <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2025/s1">84-9</a>. Next they will debate the bill, then there will be a vote to end debate and then if that passes the 60 vote threshold needed, the bill itself will receive a vote.</p> <h2>Next Week</h2> <p>Coming up next week will be <a href="https://www.congress.gov/committee-schedule/weekly/2025/01/13">the first hearings</a> on President-elect Trump's cabinet nominees.</p>

                                <p>Hello GovTrackers,</p> <p>Happy new year and welcome to a very special edition of the GovTrack newsletter as we get ready for the start of the 119th Congress which began Friday, January 3rd at noon, when the legislators elected last November took office.</p> <p><strong>The House of Representatives</strong> voted on who will serve as Speaker of the House and on procedural rules for the chamber for the next two years. These votes are enormously consequential because they determine the playing field on which everything will happen.</p> <p>I‚Äôve written several lengthy pieces on my organization‚Äôs substack on <a href="https://firstbranchforecast.substack.com/p/previewing-the-house-rules">why the House rules matter so much</a> and what‚Äôs contained in the <a href="https://firstbranchforecast.substack.com/p/republicans-propose-rules-for-the">House Republican rules package</a>. (I also wrote about a <a href="https://firstbranchforecast.substack.com/p/the-new-years-eve-ethics-massacre">sneak attack on congressional ethics</a>.) They‚Äôre pretty wonky and contain a ton of detail. Let me give you the highlights.</p> <blockquote> <p>To fund Daniel's work tracking the House rules package you can <a href="https://secure.givelively.org/donate/fund-for-constitutional-government/american-governance-institute"><em>donate directly to his nonprofit organization, the American Governance Institute</em></a> (or since Daniel is also on our staff you could also <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/accounts/membership"><em>leave us a tip here</em></a>).</p> </blockquote> <p>At the start of each new Congress, every two years, representatives in the House are on a level playing field: there is no Speaker, there are no committees, there are no officers of the House (like the nonpartisan Chief Administrative Officer), and all the legislation from the prior Congress disappears. They start afresh except for what‚Äôs in the Constitution and some general parliamentary principles.¬† So one of the first things that happens is the chamber elects a Speaker of the House and then votes on rules to govern the chamber.¬†</p> <p>Those rules create the committees and the power structure for party leaders. As I write this there‚Äôs an open question as to whether Rep. Johnson has enough votes to become Speaker. Other factions within the Republican party are negotiating for power. The form of those negotiations include both modifications to the House Rules and appointments to powerful positions, such as Chair of the House Rules Committee.</p> <p>Although the Republican leadership‚Äôs proposed rules were largely a copy-paste of the rules for the 118th Congress, there are some changes. One major difference has to do with the procedure for removing the Speaker, which played a key role in the 118th Congress. Previously, any single member of Congress could bring up a resolution to remove the Speaker. Now, <em>nine</em> Republicans have to co-sponsor such a resolution for it to be considered. This strengthens the hand of the Speaker significantly and also undermines the ability of a majority of the House of Representatives to change who is serving as Speaker.</p> <p>The other major difference is that the Rules place twelve specific bills on a glide path to a vote on the House floor without allowing for hearings or amendments, by limiting debate, and waiving all the other chamber rules. (Some of these bills have already gone through committee, and fast-tracking those allows the House to pick up where it left off.) These bills are:</p> <ul> <li> <p>For compliance with ‚Äútitle IX‚Äù in athletics, to define sex based solely on a person‚Äôs reproductive biology and genetics at birth (a version <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hr734">passed in 2023</a>)</p> </li> <li> <p>To take into custody non-citizens who have been charged with theft.</p> </li> <li> <p>To make sex offenses and domestic violence deportable offenses. (a version <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hr7909">passed in 2024)</a></p> </li> <li> <p>To make the assault of a law enforcement officer a deportable offense (a version <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hr2494">passed in 2023</a>)</p> </li> <li> <p>To withhold federal funding that goes to ‚Äúsanctuary cities‚Äù to benefit undocumented immigrants (a version <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hr5717">passed in 2024</a>)</p> </li> <li> <p>New criminal and immigration penalties for intentionally fleeing a pursuing Federal officer while operating a motor vehicle (a version <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hr5585">passed in 2024</a>)</p> </li> <li> <p>To prohibit a health care practitioner from failing to exercise the proper degree of care in the case of a child who survives an abortion or attempted abortion (a version <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hr26">passed in 2023</a>)</p> </li> <li> <p>To sanction the International Criminal Court for issuing an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, or if it investigates, arrests, detains, or prosecutes any American or ally of the United States. (a version <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hr8282">passed in 2024</a>)</p> </li> <li> <p>A likely-<a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hr5988">bipartisan</a> bill¬† to fix double-taxation of residents of Taiwan who pay U.S. taxes</p> </li> <li> <p>To require proof of United States citizenship to register an to vote (a version <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hr8281">passed in 2024</a>)</p> </li> <li> <p>To amend the Controlled Substances Act with respect to the scheduling of fentanyl (a version <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hr467">passed in 2023</a>)</p> </li> <li> <p>To prohibit a moratorium on the use of hydraulic fracturing (a version <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hr1121">passed in 2024</a>)</p> </li> </ul> <p><strong>The Senate is a different story</strong>. It is a continuing body, so its committees and officers and rules continue from Congress to Congress. With power flipping to Republicans from Democrats, the Senate will need to pass an organizing resolution that places new senators on committees and redesignates who will serve as chairs of those committees.</p> <p><strong>In both chambers</strong>, the next major legislative step will be certification of the presidential election results on Monday, January 6th. There also will likely be a resolution to allow former President Jimmy Carter to lie in state at the Capitol. It‚Äôs reasonable to expect that the certification date will put some pressure on the House Republicans to elect the Speaker relatively quickly to ensure a smooth certification of President Trump.</p> <p>We also can expect to see the Senate lining up hearings and votes to confirm some of Trump‚Äôs nominees to lead various federal agencies, although the votes can‚Äôt take place before the 20th when Trump is sworn in.</p> <blockquote> <p>To fund Daniel's work tracking the House rules package you can <a href="https://secure.givelively.org/donate/fund-for-constitutional-government/american-governance-institute"><em>donate directly to his nonprofit organization, the American Governance Institute</em></a> (or since Daniel is also on our staff you could also <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/accounts/membership"><em>leave us a tip here</em></a>).</p> </blockquote>

                                <p><em>Here's our third article on current and former members of Congress that have been nominated to cabinet positions in the next Trump Administration. Congress returns this Friday to gavel out the 118th and gavel in the 119th. It may not go smoothly.</em></p> <hr> <h3>How did Trump‚Äôs Veterans Affairs Secretary nominee Doug Collins vote in Congress?</h3> <p><a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/doug_collins/412531">Former Rep. Doug Collins (R-GA9)</a> is President-elect Donald Trump‚Äôs pick to replace <a href="https://www.va.gov/opa/bios/secva.asp">Denis McDonough</a> as Secretary of Veterans Affairs. The position requires confirmation by the Senate.</p> <p>Collins served in the House from 2013 to 2020, However, as a Military.com article <a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2024/11/15/who-doug-collins-look-trumps-pick-head-va.html">noted</a>, Collins ‚Äúdid not play a prominent role on veterans issues during that time [in Congress] and never served on the House Veterans Affairs Committee.‚Äù</p> <p>Instead, he appears to have been nominated largely due to his military biography. Collins served as a Navy Reserve chaplain in the 1980s, left to earn divinity and law degrees, then rejoined the military as an Air Force chaplain after the September 11, 2001 attacks, including a 2008 deployment to Iraq.</p> <p>He declined to run for reelection in 2020 to run for Georgia‚Äôs Senate seat, but <a href="https://results.enr.clarityelections.com/GA/105369/web.264614/#/detail/10100">finished third in the open primary</a>, failing to advance to the runoff with the top two candidates. (The seat was open due to a resignation. Trump publicly <a href="https://www.ajc.com/blog/politics/collins-strongly-considers-senate-bid-kemp-doesn-tap-him/EWZt5MyKyGyVGQdWjMW1RN/">advocated that Georgia‚Äôs governor appoint Collins</a> to temporarily fill the seat, though the governor selected someone else.)</p> <p>Since leaving office, Collins has <a href="https://americafirstpolicy.com/team/doug-collins">served as Georgia‚Äôs state chair</a> for the Trump-affiliated America First Policy Institute.</p> <h4>Bills about veterans</h4> <p>Collins was the lead sponsor of <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/browse?sponsor=412531">117 bills</a> in Congress, several related to veterans issues:</p> <h4>Newborn Care Improvement Act</h4> <p>This bill would have doubled the maximum length of healthcare provided for a baby born to a veteran at a VA hospital or facility, from seven days to 14. Collins introduced the bill with bipartisan cosponsorship in <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr5475">2014</a>, <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/hr423">2015</a>, and <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/hr907">2017</a>, but it never received a House vote.</p> <p>Current law <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/38/1786#">remains seven days</a>.¬†</p> <h4><a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/hr2478">Expanding Veterans‚Äô Access to Choice Act</a></h4> <p>In 2014, a series of scandals emerged about VA hospital and medical facility backlogs and wait times, particularly focusing on one Phoenix facility. Ultimately, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/9/26/18080592/va-scandal-explained">up to 40 veterans died while waiting for medical care</a> in Phoenix alone. Overall, <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/06/10/what-led-to-the-veterans-affairs-scandal">at least 42 VA institutions were placed under investigation</a>. President Obama‚Äôs VA Secretary Eric Shinseki <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/31/us/politics/eric-shinseki-resigns-as-veterans-affairs-head.html?hp">resigned</a>.</p> <p>In response, Congress enacted a new law that same year with a number of reforms. Yet even after the enactment, Collins thought something was still missing. So he added a short addendum for clarification:</p> <p>Any veteran who lived within 40 miles of a VA hospital, but couldn‚Äôt be assigned a VA doctor or receive their needed medical care within that 40 mile distance, still remained eligible for the government‚Äôs Veterans Choice medical program.</p> <p>The bill attracted bipartisan cosponsorship but never received a standalone vote. As far as GovTrack can determine, it does not appear the measure was ever enacted.</p> <h4>Major votes about the VA</h4> <p>Collins voted for perhaps the three biggest veterans-related laws during his congressional tenure ‚Äì although that‚Äôs not too revealing about his priorities, since the vast majority of Congress voted for all three as well.</p> <p>However, the subsequent history of those laws reveal how congressional intent doesn‚Äôt always work as intended in practice.</p> <p>First was the aforementioned <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr3230/text">Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014</a>, a set of reforms after the VA health scandals. The House vote was almost unanimous at <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/113-2014/h467">420-5</a>, with all five dissents from Republicans. Collins voted for it.</p> <p>However, the Obama-era VA <a href="https://www.govexec.com/management/2016/06/congress-obama-administration-face-over-firing-executives/129191/">stopped implementing aspects of the law in 2016 related to firing and disciplining employees</a>, claiming the provisions were unconstitutional.</p> <p>Next was the <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/s1094">VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017</a>, which <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/s1094/summary#oursummary">GovTrack covered at the time</a>. That bill enhanced immunities for in-house whistleblowers and made it easier for the VA Secretary to fire employees, particularly after the revelation that some employees had <a href="http://www.militarytimes.com/articles/commentary-rubio-isakson-roe-va-legislation">watched pornography on work computers yet weren‚Äôt fired</a>. The House vote was <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/115-2017/h307">368-55</a>. Collins voted for it.</p> <p>That time, 54 of the 55 dissents were Democrats, concerned that avenues for <a href="https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2017/06/23/trump-signs-va-accountability-measure-into-law/">employee appeals were too restricted</a>. Indeed, an appeals court and federal labor boards subsequently curtailed the law. L.</p> <p>In response, Republicans in the current Congress introduced the <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hr4278">Restore VA Accountability Act</a>, which would create another mechanism making it easier for VA employees to be disciplined or fired in a way that might fare better in the courts. The GOP-controlled House Veterans‚Äô Affairs Committee <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CRPT-118hrpt425/pdf/CRPT-118hrpt425.pdf">passed it in March</a>, but it may not get a vote in the full chamber or in the Senate.</p> <p>Finally was the <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/s2372">VA MISSION Act of 2018</a>, which provided a series of technical changes to the agency. The House vote was <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/115-2018/h189">347-70</a>. All 70 dissenters were Democrats, who opposed the bill‚Äôs <a href="https://democrats-veterans.house.gov/news/press-releases/ranking-member-walz-statement-va-mission-act-becoming-law#:%7E:text=%E2%80%9CTime%20and%20again%2C%20House%20Democrats,cuts%20to%20existing%20VA%20programs.">lack of a sustainable funding source</a>. The acronym MISSION stood for Maintaining Internal Systems and Strengthening Integrated Outside Networks.</p> <h4>What Congress is saying</h4> <p>Collins ‚Äúknows the trials of the battlefield, having completed a deployment to Iraq‚Ä¶ and has a strong understanding of the policies that impact veterans,‚Äù Senate Veterans‚Äô Affairs Committee top Republican <a href="https://www.veterans.senate.gov/2024/11/ranking-member-moran-statement-on-president-trump-s-nomination-of-rep-doug-collins-to-be-secretary-of-veterans-affairs">Sen.

                                <p><em>Today we bring you the next in our series on current and former members of Congress nominated to a cabinet post by President-elect Trump.</em></p> <hr> <p><a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/lee_zeldin/412646">Former Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-NY1)</a> is President-elect Donald Trump‚Äôs pick to replace <a href="https://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/epa-administrator">Michael Regan</a> as EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) administrator. The position requires confirmation by the Senate.</p> <p>Zeldin served in the House from 2015 to 2023, when he declined to run for reelection to focus on his Republican nomination for New York governor, which he lost in an election that was <a href="https://www.cityandstateny.com/politics/2022/12/votes-lee-zeldin-outnumbered-registered-republicans-most-new-york-city-assembly-districts/381316/">much closer than expected</a>.</p> <p>Both Republicans and Democrats alike describe Zeldin‚Äôs expected nomination as about rolling back environmental protections to support big business.</p> <h4>Bills introduced</h4> <p>During his eight years in Congress, he was lead sponsor of <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/browse?sponsor=412646">84 bills</a>. By GovTrack‚Äôs count, by far his most common primary issue area was ‚ÄúArmed Forces and National Security‚Äù at 24%. Zero were primarily related to the category ‚Äúenvironmental protection.‚Äù</p> <p>That‚Äôs because Zeldin is generally opposed to environmental protection. Indeed, he introduced at least two bills that would kill <em>more</em> fish.</p> <p>2017‚Äôs <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/hr1195">Local Fishing Access Act</a> would have allowed striped bass fishing in an area called the EEZ (Exclusive Economic Zone) by his New York district. 2015‚Äôs <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/hr1888">Fluke Fairness Act</a> would have allowed fishers in his district to catch more fluke fish, <a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species/summer-flounder">also known as summer flounders</a>, as New York state‚Äôs commercial sector only reeled in <a href="https://riverheadlocal.com/2015/04/25/federal-fluke-fairness-act-would-correct-inequitable-treatment-of-l-i-anglers-schumer-zeldin/">less than 10%</a> of its estimated potential fluke haul. Neither bill passed.</p> <p>The League of Conservation Voters gave him a lifetime <a href="https://scorecard.lcv.org/moc/lee-zeldin">14%</a> score. Of the 235 votes the organization marked as important environmental votes during his tenure, he cast what they deemed a ‚Äúpro-environment‚Äù vote in 32.</p> <p>However, those 32 votes included several where Zeldin was one of the only House Republicans doing so. Here are three examples.</p> <h4><a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/116-2019/h525">Coastal and Marine Economies Protection Act</a></h4> <p>Zeldin‚Äôs 2019 vote would have banned offshore drilling off both the Atlantic and Pacific U.S. coasts.</p> <p>House Democrats almost unanimously supported it by 226-5, while House Republicans almost entirely opposed it by 12-183, making Zeldin one of only a dozen members of his party to vote in favor.</p> <p>The Senate never voted on the measure.</p> <h4><a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/116-2019/h383">EPA funding on carbon pollution</a></h4> <p>In 2019, Zeldin voted against blocking the EPA‚Äôs implementation of new tougher standards on carbon pollution.</p> <p>House Democrats voted almost unanimously in opposition by 1-233, with only <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/collin_peterson/400316">Rep. Collin Peterson (D-MN7)</a> in favor. House Republicans almost entirely supported it by 177-21, making Zeldin one of less than two dozen members of his party to vote against. Due largely to Democrats, the measure failed, meaning the EPA‚Äôs rule stood.</p> <p>(Interestingly, one of the few other Republican dissenters was <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/matt_gaetz/412690">former Rep. Matt Gaetz</a>, Trump‚Äôs original nominee for Attorney General before dropping out, and hardly known as an environmentalist.)</p> <h4><a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/116-2019/h634">Shark Fin Sales Elimination Act</a></h4> <p>Zeldin‚Äôs 2019 vote would have banned the shark fin animal parts used as a delicacy in some food items such as soups.</p> <p>House Democrats almost unanimously supported it by 221-2, while House Republicans opposed it by 89-104 ‚Äì pitting Zeldin against most members of his party. Though the House passed the measure, it never received a Senate vote in that Congress.</p> <p>Congress ultimately enacted it three years later as a <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/117/hr7776/text/enr#link=E_LIX_E_5946_b&amp;nearest=HA4D7B704DD9C419883DD735F0B7CD05A">provision</a> in the <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/117/hr7776/text">1,772-page</a> annual National Defense Authorization Act for 2022. Though that package passed the House overwhelmingly by both parties, Zeldin <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/117-2022/h516">didn‚Äôt cast a vote</a>.</p> <h4>What Congress is saying</h4> <p>‚ÄúPresident Trump has made a strong choice in selecting [Zeldin] to lead the [EPA],‚Äù Senate Environment and Public Works Committee top Republican <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/shelley_capito/400061">Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV)</a>  <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/republicans-ready-to-confirm-trumps-epa-nominee/">said in a statement</a>. ‚ÄúI look forward to promptly considering Rep. Zeldin‚Äôs nomination in the [committee] and to working with him to roll back regulatory overreach and unleash American energy production.‚Äù</p> <p>Democrats strongly oppose the selection.¬†</p> <p>‚ÄúDonald Trump has chosen to reward a 2020 election denier, whose only job will be to reward corporate polluters by gutting the EPA and making our air and water dirtier,‚Äù <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/edward_markey/400253">Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA)</a>  <a href="https://x.com/SenMarkey/status/1856102898892951756">posted on X</a>, formerly Twitter. ‚ÄúIn Congress and the courts, we‚Äôve got a fight ahead.‚Äù</p> <p>In 2019, <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/116-2019/s33">no Senate Democrats voted for Trump‚Äôs last EPA Administrator nominee Andrew Wheeler</a>, though he was confirmed in the Republican-led chamber anyway. A similar outcome seems likely here.¬†</p> <p>The Senate will vote on Trump‚Äôs nominees once they are formally nominated after he takes office, but senators have already begun meeting with the expected nominees. They may also hold hearings ahead of Trump‚Äôs inauguration, to expedite the confirmation process.</p> <p>===============================</p> <p><em>Update, January 5, 2025: we originally stated that Democrats had the majority in the Senate in 2019 which was incorrect. Republicans had the majority.</em></p>
